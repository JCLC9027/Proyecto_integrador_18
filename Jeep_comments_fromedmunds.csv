"I special ordered my car , waited patiently for 4 months I finally get it and I should NOT HAVE ACCEPTED IT. No Macintosh stereo like I paid for NO AIR RIDE LIKE I PAID FOR. I needed a car and i loved the way it looked. I accepted it so SORRY I DID. The 2nd month I had it the radio and navigation kept making loud humming sounds and screen go black this happens about 5 x till this day it blacks out , side mirrors don’t open when I start car. Ambient lights stopped working they fixed. Next while driving a sensor fell off. Then the sway bar broke and I never went off roading , then I get stuck 11 pm at night had to get it towed to dealer a valve was bad. Even service manager said it sounds like [non-permissible content removed]. They had car for a week they fix it . The cordless phone charger heats up my phone that my phone high temp come on. Mirrors again don’t open they replace the passenger side mirror.still most times mirrors don’t open when I start car. From day one I told them I smell antifreeze heater core they say no after a yr windshield is fogging up. That’s a sign of heater core. While driving my mud flap falls off they still till this day 7 months have not replaced it an they say they ordered it. Most recent my lane assist and automatic collision not working , when I was parked in a shopping mall I was in my car parked far from anyone with air conditioning on listening to radio. My dash light makes loud sound stop on dashboard light comes on. I jump no one was near me. I bring it in they change a computer module a break sensor and they change my steering wheel. A few days later I’m driving on highway getting off the exit two cars in front of me. The front car stops dead on the exit the car in front of me breaks hard just missing him and I break hard a hair before smashing him the automatic breaking system never came on. I had a lemon law case before the automatic crash and lane assist didn’t work and I LOST MY CASE EVEN WITH ALL THOSE THINGS WRONG ,they said the car wasn’t deemed unsafe. I have voice recordings of the service manager saying the jeep is a POS that jeep should burn it. He recently said on recording him that now it is UNSAFE. I RECENTLY OPENED ANOTHER LEMON LAW CASE. I WILL BEVER EVER BUY JEEP AGAIN. NEVERRRRR",1,6/25/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

"I leased a high altitude in August 2034. I did some research however after my last car was written off, I had to get something and getting a plug in hybrid quickly was an issue. I always wanted a jeep and see so many (non plug in) around I thought why not. After 2 weeks of owning it the apply CarPlay constantly cut out. Dealer said there is a wire behind the dash that needs replaced but the wire is being made so just have to wait. Okay not a huge deal. As the weather started to drop the vehicle went into a fuel and oil refresh mode. I had read about this but thought it would come back out of the mode when the engine got warm. Nope! The weather got decently warm for about two weeks in November where it should have come out of it but nothing. The change oil light came on and about a week later while driving every light in the car came on and the wipers went crazy and the car died however was stuck in “run” mode. While standing outside of the car it turned itself back on, did the weird lights thing again and shut off. After waiting a couple minutes the gas only engine came back on with the check engine light on. Took it to the dealership where it sat for a week. During the week I read in the US there is a recall. In Canada there is not so they basically flashed the computer and did the oil change. When picking it up I was told there is a dead speaker inside the front bumper (a pedestrian alert speaker) that came dead from the factory that they will order but also have no timeline. Fast forward 2 weeks later and the vehicle says it won’t go into electric mode for no reason. The fuel oil refresh came back on a day after that and now a week later, it says it needs another oil change! Im happy I leased this because brand new this vehicle was 73000 CAD and 4 months later another dealership told me its worth 51000 CAD. So much for jeeps not depreciating as much. Listen to the reviews before considering because the headaches are endless! And now I’ve got a vehicle I don’t even feel okay taking on a road trip! ",1,12/30/2023,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe

Great Jeep!,5,12/29/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"Wow, the 2023 GC L is the first jeep our family has ever owned, and I have to saw, we are pretty impressed, The one we bought is gray with the black roof. The exterior of the van has quite a classy look to it, it somehow manages to look Luxurious even on the out side and I really like it, one kind of strange thing is that ours didn't come with side steps, or mud guards, which is kind of strange, but because of the quadra lift air suspension it can lower down pretty low for ease of entering and exiting. The big 21"" rims on the summit reserve trime look really nice and they go well with the over all vehicle, the only problem with that is that they would negatively affect the ride quality a little bit. The interior is also not what you would expect from a Jeep, with tons of features and tech everywhere. The massage function in the two front seats work really well, and the McIntosh sound system is perfectly crisp, and clear, with deep bass. the ambient lighting really adds a nice touch. I also really like the big mode selector nob in the center console, it feels well built, sturdy and nice to use and looks like it would be perfectly at home in an actual high end luxury vehicle. There is also no shortage of power outlets in the jeep. There is at least 4 in the front, (2 usb c type and 2 usb a type), 4 more in the second row, and even 4 MORE in the third row. The third row is probably the best I've been in, in 3 row midsize SUV's, the leg room could be a bit better, but its livable, you even get things like slightly padded armrests back there, which might seem not very relevant, but in a third row that's like luxury. There is also some really useful tech in the jeep, like the ""fam cam"" in the rear of the cabin, so the driver can look at the 2nd and 3rd row passengers without turning around or using the rear view mirror, it would be especially useful when you have a baby back there in a car seat. The night vision camera on the front is also really useful for picking up pedestrians in the dark, and even highlights them to the driver on the screen. So far we haven't ford any issues with the build quality, like some people complained about, the material quality is also pretty good, even featuring things like real wood, which most of its competitors like the Toyota Prado, or Kia Telluride wouldn't have. The jeep also comes with something almost no other vehicles have which is a secondary screen in the dashboard for the front seat passenger. The angle of headrests on the fronts seats can also be adjusted to suit different people s posture. The Grand Cherokee we got came with the base 3.6L Petron V6, and from what I heard about it I expected it to be dead as nit, true it isn't exactly a speed demon, but the big van surely doesn't exactly feel under powered, and it actually produces quite a nice sound from the rear end. Of course it is not going to sound as good as the v8, or be as appealing, but it isn't actually that bad. Because of the quadralift air suspension system the jeep can lift up pretty high, and is surprisingly capable off-road, but I guess its a jeep, so it would have kind of have come naturally for it to be a competent off-roader.",5,12/27/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L
"Wife loves to drive her Jeep Cherokee. She likes the backup warning system, the lane centering and the large touch console. She does not like it is missing a CD player and missing a garage door opener. Passenger seat is not powered and the back lift gate is not powered. ( Dealer tried to tell us the reason for the missing items was they would cause or have problems if the Jeep was taken off road.) Jeep Cherokee was the only SUV in the OKC metro that could be towed flat. The Latitude LUX was the better riding, and had more sedan type features, but the Trailhawk was the only one with the proper transmission. Wife does not like the passenger seat, and there are items not in the Trailhawk, but the vehicle drives well.",4,12/26/2023,2023 Jeep Cherokee
I love the size and handling of the Jeep Cherokee. It’s just the right size for me. I also love the amenities in this Jeep ,5,12/24/2021,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"Battery died and left us stranded twice. Jeep customer service is terrible. It has been in the shop more than on the road in our first six months of ownership. Buyer beware these SUVs have serious reliability issues. For $56k, you can do way better!",1,12/23/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe

"I purchased a used 2021 Jeep Cherokee Limited 6 months ago. Its comfortable, not too high up. and has some very useful safety features that are standard equipment. It uses 87 octane gas and I get about 24 mpg in mixed driving. Definitely get the 6 cylinder, it has plenty of power. My only cons are it has a smallish gas tank and i dislike the lane keeping assist feature. Fortunately it is easily disabled. ",5,12/20/2023,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"I previously had a 2016 X5, then a 2019 F-Pace and wanted a hybrid. I heard Jeep were not the most reliable so decided to lease a 2024 High Altitude 2024 from Simi Valley in CA. The sales team were amazing, the service was super friendly and very quick. My commute to work is around 22 miles, I installed a fast charger at my office so Mon-Fri I drive entirely on my battery. I reduced my gas bill down to one tank a month vs 4-5 that I was eating through before. My insurance also reduced which was a pleasant surprise. The High Altitude has all the extras that you'd want, electric roof, heated seats and wheel, blind spot monitoring and emergency breaks. I love the look of it with the body colored bumpers and uprated alloys. It's incredibly practical and whilst it wont blow your socks off at the lights it gets around very well. My only negatives are to do with the battery - if you go uphill it will get through your charge very quickly, obviously having a longer range would be better but I am sure that will come with time. The car drives as you would expect, I honestly think it is great fun, it's practical and cheap to run. I've done a couple of road trips in it, obviously these were on gas rather than charge, the leather seats are very comfortable and I was able to store everything I needed with ample room for more. Genuinely enjoying my Jeep experience! ",4,12/20/2023,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"Just don’t!! Custom built Wrangler Sport 2.0 Turbo in 2021. Less than 9 months and 13,500k miles in experienced shaking, loss of acceleration, and overheating. Towed and was diagnosed as engine failure. Almost 7 weeks with a loaner. Get it back from dealer and 2 months in at about 15k, loss of acceleration and shuts down. Told needs new transmission. Reach out finally to Jeep wave where I’m informed the engine was never actually replaced, only part replacements. This is NOT the experience I was looking for when I purchased a brand new Jeep. Absolute nightmare. ",1,12/19/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"I bought a demo Jeep Cherokee Limited in December 2023 so there were lots of discounts for a cash buyer, over $11,000 off of MSRP in Canada. The vehicle is comfortable, has reasonable acceleration and genuine capability in bad weather. I found the uConnect system easy to use and setup and I do recommend the Sirius Guardian package for additional safety and convenience. I used some of my saving to buy the extended warranty up to 7 years. It does appear though that most of the issues with the Cherokees have been resolved. There have been no recalls on the 2022 models. I do recommend the V6 engine to avoid the oil leak issues with the 4 cylinder turbo engine. Cargo space is limited with the rear seats up and reasonable with the rear sears down. There are higher rated mid size SUVs but with the large discounts, the Jeep Cherokee Limited beat them all on value and features and the extended warranty keeps my total cost of ownership reasonable. I am a fan of HD Radio and the uConnect system does an excellent job of pulling in HD Radio stations compared to the Kenwood radio in my previous vehicle. It is a great feature if you want CD quality sound with no subscriptions. I was pleased to see that Jeep now uses both synthetic oil and synthetic automatic transmission fluid. This should improve long term durability in two keep systems. ",5,12/18/2023,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"I’ve had mine for one 8 month now ; 2023 Rubicon. I had one issue with the bat thery coolant pump that was all. I’m driving it as a daily and has 9300 miles on it in the last . The vehicle is fun to drive , and corners well. The Tires it comes with are the KO2 from BF GoodRich and they are great in all conditions but rain. The brakes however could be better, they are still sluggish even after they have been worn in. Must be ready for those folks who slam their brakes when they see a yellow light, or any sudden stoped Even after they are broken in they are still weak even with the regen brake . I’m 107k into thi$ vehicle and they should have put Brembo brakes on this thing with a 4 piston caliper . The vehicle is very heavy and is combined with with Barley adequate braking especially when not using the Max regeneration mode. Also I wish they put the max regeneration button on the stick shifter . Also the Max Regeneration button should be better quality . When I press it too fast it won’t register that I pressed it. It needs to be a button that clicks on and off & is guaranteed to work no mattter how fast it’s presses/depressed. I had it go into FORM after 1200 miles where the hybrid systems went down , I drove it to the top of a mountain and FORM went away just as I reached the top & started to decend. No it’s not a perfect Hyrid system, No it’s not as refined and polished as Others like Toyota , But if you can get a non lemon ?? that runs good , it may be well worth the trouble to figure out how this vehicle operates best. I just got my 240v charging station installed at home and it charges in 2hrs at 7.5KW. The wife loves the vehicle , and so do I. Although it needs mudflaps…. It sprays mud all over the side of the vehicle and even under the door jams …. Be sure to add 3M tape to your door hinges so they don’t get chipped up like mine. So far I usually go 2000 miles on electric for every 300 miles on gas ?? I’m getting 24-28 miles per charge dash now says 44mpg ",5,12/18/2022,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"Other than it taking 11 months since I ordered the Grand Cherokee 4xe, I was finally able to take deliver the first of December. Other than one minor glitch that my Jeep service department was able to rectify quickly, so far the Jeep has been a pleasure to drive. If I have a complaint, it seems to have less storage than previous Grand Cherokees. This is the 5th one I’ve owned and the glove box and center consoles seems to hold less. Perhaps I should be reviewing this again after owning for more than two weeks, but do far I’m happy with it.",5,12/18/2022,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
"I just got the jeep grand cherokee 4xe overland a month ago. I got it because I wanted a flat tow vehicle but I wanted an electric hybrid. Jeep has two electric hybrids that can be flat towed. I replaced a 2014 overland. This car is quiet and smooth as silk. The electric capacity may not seem like much at 25-30 miles, but most retired people seldom drive more than 30 miles in a day. I’ve used this car everyday for a month and haven’t used an ounce of gas. That makes me feel good for the enviroment. Not everyone will agree with me on that, but I doubt I’ll be buying gas more than once every two-three months, if that. The electronics on the car are top of the line. Apple car play and Alexa makes it all the sweeter. I find it very comfortable, quiet and as I said very smooth. Hook up for flat towing is exactly the same as my previous 2014 grand Cherokee…so again another plus for me., one push of a button to disengage the wheels and you’re ready to roll. I think it’s the easiest set up for flat towing. The car is slightly wider and longer than the 2014 one. For those that know the overland, it comes with most of the bells and whistles. What I was disappointed in is the fact that the overland does NOT come with a wireless charging pad….come on Jeep, at these prices, what corporate exec made that blunder…petty, very petty. You have to order an advance tech package that’s a couple of thousand more to get one. I honestly think jeep should provide a wireless charging retrofit to existing owners. Sticker is $70,000+ as it is. The only other thing I don’t like is the piano black finish of the console…it looks great, but finger prints have to be constantly cleaned off…again, another blunder by product management. Over all, I really like this car…it got good looks inside and out, I can run on electric just about every day, and I can flat tow this vehicle with ease. I know there are some naysayers out there that say this and that about the electric portion of the car…doesn’t save enough money to make it worth it, etc. I say I’m trying to do my share by getting this hybrid…I didn’t buy it to save gas money…I bought it to help out the environment however little that may be.",4,12/16/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
I believe you can’t go wrong when you buy a jeep especially if you live in Florida. Jim Browne Jeep is the only place I will purchase my vehicles in the Tampa Bay Area. The Jeep has performed excellent and the service at Jim Browne is superb.,5,12/16/2021,2022 Jeep Wrangler

It’s been in the shop on and off for the last 2 months. Jeep customer care is a joke and the dealership service department isn’t much better.

"During my search for a 2021 Jeep Renegade, I found it a popular choice. Few were available locally with people coming from out of town to pick them up before I had a chance to go to the Dealer. Not able to wait for the 2022 model, I expanded my own search and found the color and model two hours away. Internet made comparable sales easy to search and the result was limited time spent with my purchase at the Dealership and a smooth, comfortable drive home in a new Renegade.",5,12/15/2021,2023 Jeep Renegade

Below average quality. Heated seats stopped working after 1 year.,2,12/14/2022,2023 Jeep Renegade
"I had the misfortune of renting one of these for a business trip from Denver to North Platte, Nov 2023. Cold morning (18F) starts the engine sounded like a bunch of ball bearings in a spin cycle and was sluggish. The only way to warm the interior was to have the front defroster on ""max,"" setting; otherwise the HVAC puts out cool air. The engine will not run whilst idling, unless the defroster is as noted before. Hard to believe a vehicle this expensive would get crap real-world mileage (21.4 mpg, mostly highway) and not recharge the battery via regen braking or from the motor. Especially since the hotel did not have a charging station. The battery level never rose above 1%. The dashboard materials are cheap and marred by the slightest touch; uConnect is quirky. Sightlines are bad if one tries to park forward into a parking spot, resulting in kitty-waumpus parking. Some good: stereo quality, seat comfort, steering wheel feel, and bun warmers. Your money is better spent buying a Sequoia. Heck, even an Outlander. No wonder Jeep has 6 months inventory on hand.",1,11/30/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
We ordered the New Jeep 4 e Wrangler Rubicon in 2021 ! We just had our second episode with our New Jeep just dye while driving it for no reason. The first my wife was driving 60 miles an hour on the freeway and the new Jeep just shut off . She was blessed enough to maneuver the Jeep to the side of the road. We had our New Jeep at the dealership garage for over two weeks and they found nothing wrong with the vehicle. Last week I was driving our New Jeep with my entire family including my two kids. We were on a City road at 40 miles an hour. Our Jeep suddenly stopped on me & before I could react we were in the middle of the road. We all got out & tried to push the vehicle to the side but we were unsuccessful. For the next 15 minutes I was directing cars around us. Both time the Jeep started 30 minutes later & ran B perfectly. I just contacted the dealership we purchased the Jeep from & am asking them to purchase the Jeep back from us ! Very soon they will have a Multi Million Dollar lawsuit when there Jeep dyes & others are killed. I decided I don’t want that family to be mine !!!

"Did it! Did not even wait for the Title to come in on the 2023 Toyota Highlander, see my review on Toyota Highlander ""bye-bye."" First of all, we already own two Jeep Wranglers we would never trade off so we are partial to Jeep, 2018/2020. We would never own a 4xe, **** REALLY and not because it is EV which I have no problem, we owned an old Toyota Hybrid 2009 that was awesome...WHAT HAPPEN TOYOTA they put profit ahead of consumer CHEAP QUALITY, with but the hassle for only 25 miles EV time and cost of plug-in set up, and that is all you can find today on the lots not even $7500 Tax Advantage on your leases only, AND the new 2024 Wrangler Rubicons wasn't impress with interior quality....I digress...We were looking for a small SUV...something we could drive into town or the golf course, LOCAL meaning SoCal...Found a 2022 Jeep Compass Brand New, BEEP BEEP WILL ROBINSON Red Flag as 2024 is approaching, but let's give it a spin anyway... Yes, a Jeep Compass they have CHANGED, ELITE Limited 4x4, yes it is a 4x4 with a lock system not an AWD, when Jeep says 4x4, it is a 4x4, with 27% taken off, used is more expensive, the top(2022 24 miles) but you can get a great deal on a 2023 not 27% off however..People they have changed....Notice I wrote LOCAL driving, SoCal, and let me tell you why: The 2022 Compass has got a 2.4L engine, that's it!!! Would I want my kids driving a 2.4L commuting the freeways in California, NO!! We found it to be a peppy little engine, no whining noises, transmission have a decent transitions, we are averaging 29 MPG in town, 31-32 MPG highway...The Compass has changed insofar as looks and quality for the BETTER..I have driven Lexus, current models have also gotten cheap along with Toyota, and Volvo, always a awesome car XC40's, but expensive both in price and maintenance, you will not find a small SUV with, the Elite Package, high-end materials and quality comfort, than this little Compass has...Better Insulation from road noise, Real Premium Leather seats with both power and lumbar for driver and passenger: as well as the two-tone dash and door panels also premium leather, heated seats front and back, two many options to list..Comfortable and Roomy with plenty of head room, my husband is a big guy at 6'2"" and found the driving to be comfortable as well as front seat passenger, tall people will not do well in the back seat leg-room department for me anyway, I like to stretch out, head room is fine.... U-connect 5 NAVIGATION/Infotainment System, no one beats Jeep extremely easy to operate and yes, for those that prefer Apple CarPlay and Android also on deck I hate Apple CarPlay...Cargo space is perfect for a couple WITHOUT kids, golf clubs, suitcases..Ground clearance, 8.1"", on the Compass was higher than the Toyota H, and found I was hitting higher curbs we have in SoCal with the door, Toyota, when opening, not the Compass..Plan to put 235/50/19 Falken Trail AT on the Compass..The new compass is the Newer Grand Cherokee miniaturized..So if you are looking for a secondary vehicle for just a couple or single, I would highly recommend the Jeep Compass 2020-2022 with Elite Group. Going to commute? Buy the 2023 with upgraded Turbo Engine, this engine is a game changer, so look out competitors ......Side note 4 Stars because this 2022 is not a Turbo..go with the 2023 commuters..",4,11/26/2023,2024 Jeep Compass
"I bought the jeep Willy’s about a week ago. For the last 2 years I have been driving a Tesla model Y long range and I should say I love that car. However I needed a 2nd car. I test drive many cars. BMW X5, Audi Q7 and A7, Audi A4 and more. However the moment I test drive the jeep Willy’s 4xe, I fell I love with the car. Everything with this car is amazing. I love the classic look, I love the 20+ range if EV which is more than enough for my daily commute. With Tesla, the car does the driving for you! With the Jeep you go.

"I rented a 2021 Wrangler Sahara for a week while on vacation because I was thinking about buying one. Our family loved everything about it. It drives smoothly and the freedom tops come off quickly. The turning radius is great and the storage behind the back seats was surprisingly large (from my wife).We both found the front seats to be super comfortable as they hug your body. I'm only 5'8 so I don't need a ton of room, I find too many car seats are large and aren't comfortable because of this. Our 3 kids fit well in the back seat. The shifting was smooth and the pickup was good. Will definitely be buying a Wrangler in the near future. I had a smile on my face the whole time that I was driving it. We took the top off, rolled down the windows, and cranked the tunes, my 18-year-old son said that my coolness factor went way up.

"Like the title says, I bought my vehicle in May, 2023. I bought the cheapest version I could get with 4x4 and air suspension. I even bought it in white to save a few extra $$'s. I read the reviews that trash this vehicle with amazement. My experience so far (at 6,000 miles) has been great. I find the vehicle smooth, quiet and responsive (not so much so for the V6, but referencing the vehicle in turs, braking, things like that). A couple of times, the screen has frozen on me, but it resolves itself after a couple of minutes. I do think the V6 could use an increase of 30 horses & 30 lb/ft torque though. I also think the lane keeping needs refinement, although I hear from my dealer a software update is coming (?) As for major issues/complaints, I just don't have any. This is my first Jeep and it is far better than my 2020 Explorer (multiple failures in that vehicle) and Mazda Cx-9. I'm really happy with it, and I think for the most part, others will be too.",5,11/17/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

"I’ve been driving my GC 4xe for almost a month and I reluctantly love it… It is the “entry level” for the 4xe and it still feels very luxury and nice. It has all the important to me features 4x4, quiet smooth ride, nice leather seats, nice screen, extra large moonroof, alpine stereo, and it is the perfect size. The worst part is that the hybrid engine probably isn’t what the X5 or RX is. If your daily drive is within 25 miles you’ll love it. If it’s much longer and better gas mileage is very important to you go elsewhere. The transition between engines isn’t always smooth. It’s works well just not $60k+ well. If having a jeep in this segment is more to you than excellent gas mileage you’ll love it. For me it really is the sweet spot. I commute 2 or 3x a week and get between 22-25 mpg on other days it’s full electric and great (I’ve yet to buy gas but getting really close) Charge times are long, it’s 10-12 hrs and the charger gets warm. I was planning on plugging in the charger in my ceiling outlet for my garage door opener and leaving it plugged in while hanging the charge cord next to the car from there but that doesn’t seem safe. I unplug both ends each time… not as smooth as I hoped but a non issue if you get the better charger (only 3 hrs) My wife hit a pretty big pot hole going fairly fast the first time she drove it and all seems as good as new so I can tell this is well built and a real jeep. I think it looks great, again it is the perfect size for me. I’m 6’4 and fit in Just fine. I wish the seat would go down a bit more but it isn’t bad at the lowest.

But my big complaint is the ""help"" the Jeep gives the driver while steering. I live in an area with few bike lanes and lots of cyclists. When I go to give a cyclist a wide berth, I have to cross the middle road line. The Jeep doesn't like this. The first time I went around a cyclist, the Jeep unexpectedly TURNED MY WHEEL TOWARD THE CYCLIST. It's a good thing I was paying close attention! I get that it's trying to keep me in the lines, but it needs to trust the driver better. The wheel-turning is not subtle like in a Tesla, you really have to grab the wheel hard and take good control over it. Also, the acceleration from a stop is terrible. The first time I needed to *quickly* merge into traffic, I expected the Jeep to get up to speed much faster. It was SO slow, I almost ended up getting hit by faster traffic. I didn't make that mistake again! I would not recommend the Jeep Renegade.",2,10/31/2022,2023 Jeep Renegade
I love my renegade! It rides great! good gas miles with the new 4 cylinder turbo. Thank you Jeep! I love that it was made in italy!,5,10/30/2023,2023 Jeep Renegade
Love the features and color. Great for our additional family member.,5,10/28/2020,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"I recently leased a 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit Reserve 4xe. I chose it for six reasons: 1. It has a comfortable interior that is also aesthetically stunning and very functional. 2. It boasts a wide range of advanced safety and driver assistance features. 3. The McIntosh sound system is hands down the best I have ever heard in a car. 4. It gets 25 miles of all-electric range — which means that I do almost all of my daily driving on electric power. I’m buying a tank of gas about once every six or seven weeks. 5. I prefer SUVs because of the higher seating position for visibility, the flexibility for luggage and cargo, and four wheel drive for winters (it can snow heavily where I live). 6. Because of a loophole in the revised federal law covering eVehicle incentives, a lease of a Jeep PHEV still qualifies for a full $7500 capital cost reduction incentive. Positives: 1. The infotainment system is easy to use and allows a remarkable degree of customization. Apple CarPlay works great, wirelessly, and the 10.1 inch screen is fully utilized and well-positioned. 2. The climate controls include physical buttons (including for seat heaters and the heated steering wheel). 3. The driver assistance functions all work well and can be customized. 4. The front seats are fabulously adjustable and the seat massage is highly configurable — and the front passenger seat gets all the same goodies as the driver’s seat. 5. The air suspension provides a smooth ride, but not floaty — even with 21 inch wheels. And the cabin is very quiet, even at highway speeds. 6. Virtually all the electronic controls and features work as described and are easy to figure out. 7. The interior screams refinement (which I realize is a contradiction in terms) and the ambient lighting is gorgeous, and adjustable. 8. The car accelerates like a demon, for an SUV. It is literally faster than the old Jeep Grand Cherokee with the Hemi. 9. There are a number of nice features that don’t get mentioned much in the literature, like automatic high beams, easy access features for the driver, two ports for usb drives holding music (nice for his-and-hers playlists) with both USB-A and USB-C ports, a 120 volt outlet in the rear seat, four zone climate control, remote start with automatic climate setting memory and window defrost and wiper de-icing (great for returning to the car in a commuter lot in the middle of Winter), and washers for the front and rear cameras. Nits: 1. Shiny black plastic on the center stack. Lots of it. A really, really stupid design choice that looks nice in the showroom but immediately collects scratches and fingerprints when in use. 2. The only way to get the heads-up display is with a rare extra package that includes night vision, which is mostly an expensive toy unless you live in a rural area with lots of deer (where I’m told it is helpful). The heads up display should have been standard on this trim. 3. There is no wireless phone charger — one should be standard. 4. Also, a cargo security cover should have been standard. However, a good after-market version is available for a very reasonable price. 5. The Jeep handles like what it is — a big, heavy SUV — the European SUVs of the same size, like the BMW X5, handle noticeably better. Bigger issues: 1. The transmission is not well matched with the engine (which is especially disappointing because the same eight speed transmission worked seamlessly with the Hemi). It jerks and pulls at low speed — accelerating from a standing start at a stoplight can be an annoying experience. The four cylinder turbo also whines while accelerating. 2. At the end of the day, you are still interacting with a Chrysler dealer for maintenance and repairs. Anyone who has experienced a Mercedes or BMW dealership will understand what I mean. Bottom line — This Jeep, at this trim level, is soooo close to being a top-tier production luxury vehicle — it already rivals Mercedes, BMW and Audi SUVs in many respects. If Chrylser could address the nits, and the transmission, it would be a class-leading luxury car. As it is, and given that all cars have shortcomings, it is a great luxury SUV and competitive at its price. This last point is a sore spot for me — I have seen multiple professional reviews saying “It’s so expensive for a Jeep” — that’s definitely “badge snobbery.” This Jeep, in Summit Reserve trim, is as well-designed, well-featured, and as reliable (better than Mercedes and Audi, actually, if you look at the statistics) as the anointed “luxury brands.” Update: Now that I have owned the Jeep 4xe for several months, I thought I’d provide an update on my experience, both positive and negative: 1. The car has over all been a joy to own and drive. It is comfortable and quiet. 2. The new Jeep mobile app is a vast improvement over the old UConnect app. 3. Carplay stop working once, and I had to reset the system to get it to re-initialize, which erased all my preferences. I have not had a problem since, and Jeep at least made it easy to perform the reset. 4. One evening recently, a family member was driving the car and ran out of gas (long story). It happened near our home, so I went to assist, and learned three things: • The 4xe does not behave like other cars when it runs out of gas, if it has already depleted its electric-only range. The dashboard lights up like a pinball machine, with warnings that multiple systems have failed — which is not true. This because when the engine doesn’t run, the car detects all sorts of resulting electrical faults when you press the Start button. • The estimated “range to empty” is not even close to accurate when the tank is near empty. The car was reporting it still had 35 miles of gasoline range when it stalled. • The Jeep “Assist” button and the alleged road service is worse than worthless. It is borderline criminal. When you press the “Assist” button, you don’t get connected - you get an infotainment screen asking you what service to connect you to — there are several choices, no clue as to which is the right one, and the whole process only works if the ignition switch is in the “accessory” or “run” status. Then, when you finally figure it out, you get connected to an automated system that asks if you want to buy a subscription to the service you are already subscribed to. Eventually, through perseverance, you get to a live person — who is very clearly sitting somewhere in India and barely speaks English. You are told that “Dispatch” is “seeking to find a provider in your area” and you will be notified when they do. When you hear nothing for 45 minutes and call back, they tell you “Dispatch” is still looking to find a provider – to be clear, not that someone is on the way but it will be a while (which I could understand), but that they are still looking to find somebody at all. Bear in mind this all happened in a Western suburb of Chicago at 9 PM, amid a concentrated population of several million people. There were at least ten 24-hour towing and road service companies within 10 miles of the car’s location (I checked later). When the local police stopped to check on us and offered to help (thank you, Officer Beth), they had roadside assistance there in ten minutes. Whoever at Stellantis signed off on this miserable excuse for a roadside service should be summarily fired for incompetence. I have deducted one star from my prior review because of the miserable ""Assist"" service.",4,10/26/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe

"We had a Jeep Cherokee 2019 which we enjoyed for 3 years+ without any issue. We switched to 2022 Toyota Rav4 and it wasn't a very comfortable ride for a family of 4 with a little one. Tried Kia Telluride SX, Hyundai Palisade Limited, Toyota Highlander and Jeep Grand Cherokee L Limited/Overland. Jeep outmatched others by far when it comes to comfort, style and available options, though pricier of all 4. Highlander was quite cramped. Telluride/Palisade seems to have only price advantage, which may not work always, given dealership markups (especially for Kia Telluride). Now, we own a Jeep Grand Cherokee L Overland and very much enjoying it after putting 1000 miles on it. The only complaint we have is it's gas mileage which is averaging 17 mpg, but not sure if it would improve after first free service (yes, you get 3 free maintenances). Others in competition have similar mpg except Toyota Highlander, so they all need to work on MPG. Apart from that we are really loving Jeep Grand Cherokee L 2023 Overland 4x4.

"I took a test drive and I absolutely loved the vehicle. It was all black (interior and exterior) with nearly every option I wanted. The engine was responsive while the transmission was quick to shift, maybe too quick. I had to watch the acceleration while driving the first mile or two. I took the Renegade onto the freeway and cracked open the sunroof. This particular model have the removable panels. The car got up to speed briskly, but the sunroof, once opened, let in a lot of outside noise. If you purchase this vehicle, be advised you will be cranking up the volume on the sound system. The hood seems big, but that’s part of the Jeep experience. The infotainment worked flawlessly, with a large 8.4 inch uConnect being easy to decipher. It has a fast response time. Seating was very comfortable, with the power leather seats making finding a perfect position easy. Looking around the interior, it felt spacious, even with the black headliner. The A/C worked well, considering I took the test drive during a record-breaking heatwave in Las Vegas. Next, the rear seating area. I was able to sit back there with some room to spare. I’m 6’1”, and I was able to sit behind the driver’s seat with a couple inches to spare. There is plenty of headroom for everyone, front and back. So, if I ever need to sit I the rear (which would be rare, if ever), I could be reasonably comfortable. I checked out the cargo area and found it to be more than adequate. There is a compartment under the cargo floor to store the removable sunroof panels (with a sleeve to put them in) which I found to be a great bonus. Going to Sam’s Club for a run would not be a problem for me. Upon returning to the dealer, I took some time to look at the exterior in more detail. All the Easter eggs aside, I really like the look of the Renegade. The wheels were 19”, painted a granite color. It really gives it a polished look. Shiny and gleaming in the hot sun, it stands out quite well. What prevented me from purchasing? The dealership. The car was discounted by “$5K”, but that was due to the rebate. They didn’t even bother to negotiate with me. While I was upside down on my current vehicle, the was no way in hell I was going to pay over thirty grand ($34K to be exact) for a Renegade that has been sitting on their lot for six months. This was even with their rebate. Jim Marsh Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge/Ram lost a customer. I ended up finding the exact same Renegade with the exact same options at a dealer 250 miles away (Lake Elsinore Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge/Ram) for four grand less. They gave me a better rebate and took an additional $4500 discount. Oh, and I used TrueCar to get an additional thousand dollars off the price. With my less than perfect credit, I was still able to buy the Renegade for significantly less that what Jim Marsh tried to shackle me into. I’ll be driving my new black Jeep Renegade home in the coming days. When shopping around, take your time. Do your research. Know the pros and cons of the make and model you want, read the reviews, take the car/trick for a real test drive and shop around dealers in the area. I saved over $8K off MSRP by being patient and sticking to my guns. Thank you for reading this review and hope this was helpful.",4,09/27/2020,2023 Jeep Renegade

"It’s been a year and 9000 miles in this 2022 Willies Wrangler. This wrangler continues to be what I wanted. The engine provides for great acceleration on the highway. The ride is, as expected, for a Wrangler with off-road tires and suspension. Highway speeds of 65+ are no problem & the highway mileage average is approximately 20-25mpg. Backroads at 45-50mph can yield 22+ on daily commutes. The convertible aspect is an outstanding feature with the Wrangler and the newer soft top feature makes it much easier to take the top back 18” in seconds. The exterior gets complements all of the time. Although, in a pinch, adults can ride the back seats of the Wrangler, the back is only spacious enough for children. The option of the “all wheel drive” transmission selection has been a benefit. Winter driving with mixed road conditions makes the “AWD” selector the choice and minimizes the need to constantly shift into 4WD. Overall, the looks, mpg, and all season conveniences make this Willies a great selection. This Jeep could only be made better … with the option of a rear-locker. Why the locker? Having owned and driven SUVs Trucks & Jeeps for decades —- when you need a real locker —- you need a rear locker. One time can make the difference. If anyone truly plans to take their Willies off-Road - opt for the locker. ",5,09/25/2023,2022 Jeep Wrangler

"2023 Grand Cherokee L 4x4 Limited Options are trailering package, 506 watt 9 speaker sound system, and black appearance package. Great ride quality, quite and smooth. It's good looking and the interior is comfortable. Awesome sound system, third row searing works well with plenty of room. This generation Limited version lacks auto windshield wipers but retains the auto high beam lights. Versus our 2017 model, the auto high beams on the 23 are overly sensitive or just plain quirky, switching to high for a second or two then back to low at odd times. The upper control arms on the front suspension have a knuckle that hangs about an inch or two over the top of each front tire, severely limiting your choice to put a taller set of tires later. It is odd. The v6 engine gets the job done, but it does feel sluggish probably due to the additional weight of the L variant. There is some trickery in the way they chose to program the throttle response. What I mean is that it feels like by pressing the pedal 25 percent in its like you are getting 60 percent of the engines power and further pressing of the pedal yields lackluster results. Quick throttle response, but in the end it just doesn't have much power. Should have been a standard v8 in the L trim. One can dream. The air condition works well, but..... When the rear air is on or in auto the fan is loud in the front dash. It's strange, in that when you turn the rear air off it suddenly quites down to a normal level. If the rear air is on auto, then the fan in the front will blow at an abnormally high level no matter what you set the temperature to, period. The lock buttons as well as the rear window lock button are each backlit with a red light. These red lights are obnoxiously bright during the day time lighting. Super bright. I've tried dimming every setting I can find to no avail. Night time, it dims to an appropriate level. Strange. Overall, it is a great vehicle though, it just needs the kinks ironed out, especially at this price point. ",3,08/30/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

We traded in a 2021 BMW M50i which was a nightmare to get into the third row. Hit the wrong button and you’re in a Major waiting game. Jeeps system is much better. V8 is a must. We drove the six cylinder and it’s underwhelming at best. Love the night vision for deer in PA. McIntosh system is terrific. Massage seats are so much better than the BMW and Mercedes we owned before it. Ours is fully loaded with exception of rear entertainment and high alt pkg. Factory running boards look and work great. Wireless charging of iPhone works great. BMW’s was dismal. We get many compliments on this Summit reserve model. The only thing we miss are heated and cooled cup holders & soft close doors.

"I am glad I didn't go by ""expert"" review, test drove and took this car! I had 2021 Compass leased and received promotional offer from dealer to turn it it 5 months in advance with no penalty, if I lease newer Jeep. I am so happy that I took the offer! This newer Compass is such an improvement compared to 2021 model. Engine is a lot more powerful, I drove 100 mph in a short stretch of remote highway, and I didn't even feel the speed. Transmission shifts just fine, in fact it is much better than the older Compass. I don't know what car was tested by review writers who complain of quick shift to upper gear, may be they drove defective models, or need the electronic adjustment of transmission. I always felt the 2021 Compass was too sluggish and had to sometimes switch to 'manual' mode to keep it in lower gear long enough before shifting. This newer Jeep has no such issue! It will shift slow if you push accelerator, literally telling car to 'accelerate'. Now, if you touch gas pedal too slightly then it will read this as your desire to save on gas and upshift earlier, but it's UP TO YOU how you want it to go. So, you have a control and the car is very responsive. I like the large infotainment screen, which isn't confusing at all. It took me less than a minute to get used to it and intuitively figure how to use it. Interior materials are top notch. I have a Lux with leather seats, with optional panoramic sunroof, Alpine sound system with 9 speakers. LED lights, automatic high-beams, wireless Carplay, automatic collision warnings and breaks, blind-spot detection, this car has everything to make a comfortable and safe ride.

"I've wanted a Jeep for 12 years. When I learned that this Jeep was a plug in hybrid, I decided this was the one. I decided to buy it because it was advertised as getting 56 mpg. I've had it nearly 3 months now. I do not get 56 mpg. I get closer to 40. That being said, it is the nicest vehicle I've ever owned. I went from an anemic Prius to a Jeep.

"I love this vehicle. I’ve had the jeep 12 days, done daily in-town and highway driving and still have a half tank of fuel. Definitely take a test drive to experience the max gen when you take your foot off the gas and the turbo when you get on the highway. To understand and get the most out of this PHEV, pre-purchase research is essential regarding the different modes and how to avoid potential problems. My only complaint is that there are more wind sounds on the highway than I like so I just turn up the sound system…which is awesome.",5,07/25/2023,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"I currently own my 5 th jeep in the last 23 years! Have loved most of them.. Some of them have had some minor issues- leak from back seat a/c ( corrected in the next years models), a/c leak in front (corrected in next year model), and current one, leak from radio fin on roof ( my brother the mechanic fixed it- needed additional better glue). My only horrible experience - similar to one posted by someone else was in 2016, I traded my v8 jeep for a new, blue one with V6. It was leaking oil from the day I brought it home! After about 10 trips to their "" so called service department"" I had had enough! They had put in a new transmission and then wanted to put in a new motor! I refused and filed a lemon law claim. Worked directly with Chrysler and fought with this awful dealer (Collierville Chrysler/Jeep) for over 6 months! They finally were directed by corporate Chrysler to GIVE me a new identical jeep. By then, it was December 2016 and the 2017 had arrived. They had no 2016 with the same equipment. They tried to make me pay an additional $2000 for some additional equipment on the new one. I refused and demanded the new one at no additional cost- due to the ridiculous amount of time I had spent trying to get it fixed and time it was out of service, and time spent trying to get them to do the right thing. Chrysler told the dealer to give me the 2017 at no additional cost. I've been driving it since 12/16 and it has been great! Have 80,000 miles and I plan to trade it soon, Possibly for another jeep. But am looking around at other similar vehicles. ",5,07/25/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

This 2020 Jeep Renegade that I purchased with 11 miles. I was never told that this vehicle needed a software upgrade when I purchased it. This vehicle would not turn off during the first 30 days of me having the vehicle. The start button was like jelly. The windows on the vehicle there's air in the windows the car uses a lot of gas. The vehicle also drives very roughly. I was told when I took the vehicle in that in order for me to be comfortable I would have to undo the battery wait 5 minutes and then I could probably start the car at that point in time. And we must remember this was a brand new car a 2020 with 11 miles on it when I purchased it I am not a happy customer. So when my attorneys try to get Chrysler to do the buyback they refuse to do that. So they did do the software upgrade and they told me that if and when it happens again bring it back. So I am driving a vehicle that I am not comfortable with and making large payments this is unacceptable. I will never own another Chrysler Jeep Dodge or Fiat vehicle in my life and I will tell everybody else that I know not to own one,1,07/20/2021,2023 Jeep Renegade
Ac vents only in the front. This does not work in Tx heat. My kids are sweating in the back and I’m freezing up front. This car does not come with a spare!!! I guess I’m not used to that not being a standard feature. Not even a donut? I got a flat within the first few months and had to get the vehicle towed because I didn’t have a spare! Low acceleration and hard shifting and already have an electrical short in my running lights.Also the carpeting in this car is the worst I’ve ever seen It’s like Velcro for dirt. Even using professional vacuums does not get it very clean and if you have a dog that ever rides in your car I’d advice having covers or you will never get the hair out!!!Over all not super happy to pay that much and already have this many problems.

When I first bought the Compass trailhawk I was very excited. It was my first new car purchase and I loved the look of it. After getting it off the lot I realized that the odometer doesn't work and resets every time I entered the vehicle. That was the first issue. After 11k miles it began to every month start stalling I believe from either the engine consuming too much oil or the auto start/stop feature on the car. Unfortunately it spent 82 days in the shop for the first 18 months of ownership which lead to a lemon law. After not much deliberation at all Jeep agreed to buy back my car so as of this week I no longer own a Jeep. I honestly don't think I'll ever buy a Jeep again,1,07/13/2023,2024 Jeep Compass

"The GC 4xe is an amazing plug in hybrid that can tow 6000# (in the pricier trims). But don’t expect to get a hitch on the base model. To tow 6000# with the base, you have to order a $600+ tow “prep” package which does not include a hitch or wiring, which will cost another $2000 or so for 2” receiver, wiring harness and installation (you practically have to disassemble all the base trim to install). So get a Trailhawk or Overland if you’re going to tow. The 26 mile electric range is great for running errands or commuting and will increase the mileage if the gas motor is only used sparingly. The technology is amazing and will tell you anything short of Santa’s arrival time. It handles very well, cruises the highway with ease, and absorbs bumps well. The 4x4 system is reassuring, and interior adjusts well for your comfort. If you have Yakima rack components, you’ll want to get their landing pad #19 to attach to the 4xe roof rails, then you can use control towers and anothers to carry crossbars and stuff. Oh, the radio manual is almost as thick as the owner’s manual ??. I’m very satisfied with my Overland so far! Update: Starting with a fully charged battery, I recently got 27mpg on a 200 mile trip, driving 75mph on the Interstate along with about 25 miles of 62mph on State roads in Wisconsin. Not bad for a truck with 375hp that can tow 6000#! Update 2: On a recent Wisconsin camping trip towing a 4000# travel trailer for a combination of 777 miles, 508 miles gas and 269 miles electric(recharging for local sightseeing, etc.), I averaged 18.2mpg driving 56-58mph State Hwy and 68-71 Interstate. Very satisfied with that compared with 11-12 with my old Tahoe! Incidentally, someone mentioned the lack of a 4xe tachometer, but there is a lineal one across the bottom of several heads-up display screens(1. Driver Info for one), when the engine is running. It is also referred to in the Hybrid Supplement manual page 31",4,06/20/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
"Its been 4 after my car purchase and I absolutely LOVE my JEEP..... I've been seriously looking for over a year so when I saw it on Edmunds I made an appointment to see it the very next day. Since there is a limited supply of cars I was open to travel. I traveled 120 miles to get it. The car meets all expectations. I purchased the 2021 Jeep Wrangler, Unlimited Sahara, 6 speed manual transmission. The clutch placement needs a bit getting use to, it's not like other manual transmissions. After reading Jeep forums and talking to dealerships Jeep is aware of this. What also made my car search longer was I wanted the Sky One Touch top. It was definitely worth it and makes the open air experience so much easier. It's a perfect alternative if you don't have the storage space for the hard top. I'm so glad I didn't compromise this option in my car search. ",5,06/18/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler

"Lessons learned summary: Test the car on the expressway 1-2 hours. Drain the battery and drive on a 4 cylinder for a while on highway speeds. Check the roof for blistering paint. Look up the Jeep 4xe hybrid/ev/e-save and compare to standard mixed mode. Check KWh efficiency compared to other PHEVs or EVs. Look up FORM. Wow. What a bad experience as a first time Jeep buyer. Check engine light at 150 miles. Transmission jarred the car and I had to pull over and restart at one point. I've had it for a day. Issue with ""performance limited service fuel system"" which is on multiple forums for the 4xe, supposedly can be ignored, been around since 2022 models, and can actually stall you out mid drive. This happened to me! Couldn't accelerate beyond 50mph on the expressway. Unsafe to drive. Have to have it towed. Extremely limited and inefficient battery. I burned through 50% battery in ~8 miles in Hybrid mode, express way, constant speed. Apparently there's no true ""mixed"" mode for the EV and ICE. You have no choice, all 3 modes (hybrid, ev, esave) use both, and Chrysler has determined you want to use up battery always first. That means good luck having acceleration when you're using a 4 cylinder under-powered ICE when battery runs out. Look up FORM as well with the 4xe, and decide for yourself if there's times you would like to drive for an hour before EV mode is available. Happened to me in 60 degree weather. Also discovered a substantial strip of peeling paint and rust on the roof. Do some research on body shops and Jeeps coming off the line - tons of claims coming in. The Uconnect entertainment system is overly complex and doesn't provide shortcut buttons for common functions. HCAV could use actual knobs instead of switches, placement of certain controls don't make sense. Multiple touchscreen buttons to get to the front and rear camera. Hard to find Android Auto settings. Paddle shifters right next to radio controls on steering wheel. Below average storage space in the mid console area. These are all minor inconveniences eventually you will get used to, but just adds to an overall substandard experience for a 65k MSRP vehicle.",1,05/31/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe

"When the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (4-door version) was released in 2007 I knew it was in my future. Extended wheel base for smoother on-road travel and extra cargo/human capacity moved if from a fun thing to have to something more practical for every day use. Watching the Wrangler Unlimited evolve over the past 15 years only underscored what I already knew: it was the ultimate go anywhere, do anything vehicle. True: you're trading some other things for the security of knowing this guy will get you down any road and back again safely. But as the Wrangler evolves the gap between what you're giving up and what you're getting shrinks, making it a solid choice for your all around car. Assuming, of course - you want a Jeep. And the improvements made to the Wrangler JL from the previous JK series (2007 up until 2018) are nothing short of jaw dropping. The JL is equipped with all the modern tech you expect in a contemporary car: countless safety features, backup camera, easy smart phone pairing, keyless entry, etc. The tech in the modern JL Wrangler is on par with most vehicles. What it adds to the equation though is its unique spin on how the whole package comes together. The Wrangler is a more solid a vehicle than many others on the road. It is built with a predisposition for sturdy dependability. It is not a light weight, slippery, injection-molded plastic car designed to last until your loan is paid off, then move on to the next one. It is designed to be safe, dependable, viable for many years. If you're looking for an ultimate vehicle that will literally take you any place you can think of - and bring you home safely - there's no need to look beyond the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.

I brought the vehicle to Jeep to get the problem looked at. I was told it is a known problem and they are working on a fix. This was over 4 months ago.

"I bought my 2022 Snazberry Wrangler Unlimited in January 2022 and I am very happy with the overall performance, styling, rugged feel and utility of the Jeep Wrangler. I have the V-6 engine with Automatic Transmission with the premium soft top and upgraded stereo with 8"" video screen. The Jeep has all the creature comforts and more anyone could ask for. I really like the acceleration along with the visibility of traffic around me. I even think the gas mileage is good for the power it delivers. I have 2100 miles on it and i m averaging 21-22 miles per gallon. The Jeep came with Michelin tires and they handle very nicely. I really only have 1 complaint I have about the Jeep and it has to do with the soft top. The soft top is quite easy to put up and take down. However, the side and back curtains when taken down do not afford much 'flex' when it comes to folding them up to keep in the Jeep. Also, the Jeep does not really provide a compartment for the back and side curtains. The curtains have an edge to them and I don't want to put a crease or bend the edges so it is a bit difficult to place them properly in the Jeep when taken off so they do not sustain any damage. There is a slight rattle in the upper passenger side when the top is up that is a bit annoying. I have placed a towel along side the frame to absorb some of the rattle and has been effective. Otherwise, trying to pinpoint that rattle has been difficult, It is a small nuisance and really something I probably should not notice, but I do notice. It does not, however, lessen my appeal for the Jeep, as it is a very quality vehicle and one I am happy to own. I have personalized my Jeep by placing some nice side steps from Extreme Terrain, Smitty Built seat covers and a patriotic tire cover on the back. So far, very pleased with the Jeep and I have received many praises from people who have seen the Jeep.",4,04/19/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler

"One issue with locking axles that was rectified under warranty, no other mechanical issues in two years so pretty good for a Jeep. Bought for the wife who loves it. Needless to say it doesn't do any hard core off roading but it's capable. I've had Jeeps forever starting with an old, used CJ. Most have been mechanical nightmares but I had a 2004 Wrangler Sport that was my daily driver for nearly 18 years and it was great. This 2021 so far has been great too. Very reliable except for a slow leaking tire from day one. Even the cheap electronics have held up so far such as the screen and all its functions. I'm 6'2"" 320 pounds and it's miserable for me to drive long distances because it's just not designed for big/fat people. Very uncomfortable as a passenger too but everybody else is fine with it as they are all considerably smaller than I am. Its rough riding too but that should be expected since it's a Rubicon designed for off road. Bought this to replace our original Hummer H3. A Hummer exceeds a Jeep in about every category in my opinion and I say that having owned both. The Hummer is far more comfortable, rides and drives better and is all wheel drive so it outperforms in bad weather situations. That said, I have no regrets buying the Rubicon.

"I’ve had my 22’ 4XE Rubicon for 11 months and 1,100 miles. I still have 40% left until an oil change as I mostly drive in EV for errands/kids. When I drove it back from the dealer (500 miles) it was way too loud on the highway. So I put on a Hot Head Headliner and the sounds much more quiet and bearable. In the warm months I get around 25 miles of EV, but cold months I’d say it’s under 18. The Firecracker Red is a head-turner! The 1 touch skytop is a must and so convenient, especially with kids. The leather seats are comfy and I’m never sore. I bought aftermarket running boards so the kids and my spouse can get in easier. I disagree with Edmunds about the loose steering. It feels good to me and the ride isn’t as harsh as I expected. My fathers Stelvio TI Sport feels bumps more. I don’t personally like the transition from ev to hybrid. The Jeep revs/idols at around 1,700rpm for several minutes until it calms down. Jeep said it’s normal. I had some loose parts get tightened by the dealer under warranty. It feels slow in 2H, but if you put it in 4H it feels fast. All in all I really like my first Jeep. I wish it was fully electric. I just don’t care for the loud, small 4 banger sound. I use a MJJC foam cannon and SunJoe pressure washer to clean it a few times a week. That’s fun and waving to all the Jeep owners is fun the first few times.. lol. One quick update: This happened a day after my review, where 4WD, the battery, electronic stability control and ABS lights are on. The dealer said it’s still fine to drive and probably needs a new sensor. I’m driving it for 10 days like this until service can get me in. Wish me luck!",5,03/24/2023,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"Please be careful before buying this vehicle. On my 4xe, the Check Engine light came on the first day I took the possession of the vehicle. I feel this is a safety issue, as when the check engine light comes on, it turns off all the safety features - traction control, collission warning, cruise controle, regen braking, etc. My vehicle has been in the shop for last 3 months. They couldn't figure out the problem for the first 2 months, but then later they figured out it was something related to ABS. Now the replacement module is on backorder and they don't know when they will receive it due to chip shortage. Fortunately they hooked me up with a temporary rental, which allows me to get around. ",1,03/24/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"I ordered this car early May with the Gorilla Glass windshield. I did not receive it till August 9th due to production of the GG windshield not beginning till mid July and honestly it was worth every day of the wait. This car is so well put together I am honestly shocked because of all the whiney complainers that complain about the quality of this Jeep. I got a 4 door Willys fully loaded minus the one touch top; I got the Hard top instead. The Safety and Advanced safety packages are definitely worth the price especially in urban areas like Miami where the drivers are horrific, and adaptive cruise in constant stop and go traffic alleviates so much stress and fatigue. You may not think you need the advanced safety but when someone with broken taillights during the day slams on the brakes in front of you, the frontal collision warning will save you. I probably can not state this enough but this Jeep is so much fun to drive, the ride quality is surprisingly supply and taught. Compared to Range Rovers in the family it is pretty competitive and that says a lot when it comes to comfort and ability. The 2.0 with 8 speed combo in this is a perfect combination that I wanted to hate but can not. Obviously the 2.0 is not going to sound as good as the v6 but the the pros of the 2.0 outweigh the sound. Ive gotten up to 26mpg on highway driving at Florida highway speeds. That is saying alot because my Infiniti G35 did not get over 17. I have gone around the car multiple times and pushed almost every single piece and not a single piece squeaks or rattles. You push on a plastics in a mercedes, audi beemer, they all squeak but not here. Who would've thought? Not me haha. If you can get the 8.4"" Headunit with Alpine audio; the sound system for a factory system is incredible. Even with the top off its way louder than I need with crisp quality. We had a 2015 JK and it was fun to drive but so many compromises. I got this Jeep and drove 2900 miles in less than the first month of having it because of how great it is. Driving on the highway is great because of visibility; and being able to see above everyone is great during constant rush hour. The only con I guess you could say about this Jeep is that in the severe thunderstorms in FL, you have to slow down more than a normal car because its shaped like a brick so the wind pushes you around but at the same time that does not make that much of a difference. Alot of drivers will be remaining on the road when they are buying their Jeep and that is ok. I plan on off roading in a few weeks and with the Mud terrains that come on this Jeep I expect a very pleasant experience. You don't need my review to tell you, if you want a Jeep get a jeep. They are not cheap though. I've noticed these Wranglers are very cheap to lease but I am not someone who does that. The good thing is that these Jeeps hold their value extremely well. I have no plans to sell my Jeep but I have been made multiple offers for my Jeep over what I paid for it which is crazy to me but current market and demand is real. Also also, the Jeep comes with 3 years of free oil changes and tire rotations if that is your thing called Jeep Wave. Plenty of FCA dealers are offering 3 additional full synthetic oil changes and Tire rotations for $100 so that's 30k miles of service if you get it done every 5k which is generally a good rule of thumb for only $100? Say less. If you are cross shopping the Bronco, go ahead and test drive it, because that's what I did. I went in with the intention of cancelling my Jeep order but driving a fully loaded bronco made me realize Ford has alot of catching up to do. Quality of the entire vehicle is just not up to par and hopefully Ford fixes that because I really want to love the Bronco. The plastics were not good at all and altogether the car felt cheap and the sticker on the one I drove was 60k because of the Sasquatch package and other features. Unacceptable. To recap; Get a Jeep. Its awesome in every aspect, reliable, the doors come off, the roof comes off, its like having a splash of adventurous paradise every time you drive anywhere it makes me so happy. If you get a Jeep make sure to wave when you see other ones too :) 10k Mile update: it’s been over 6 months and 10k miles and I’ve seriously loved every single mile. I didn’t think I’d appreciate the Advanced Safety Group and Adaptive Cruise as much as I would. It’s aggressive enough to use in Miami rush hour and that’s speaks for itself. The car gets better MPG in the city then when I first got it. Where I used to get 14 I now get 17-19 and I still get 20-24mpg on the highway. It’s also very comfy and just all around a very fun amazing daily driver. Everything is still solid no squeaks and rattles. My only gripe is the brakes aren’t as tight as when I first got it but I’m sure a quick pedal tighten can fix that. I take the front 2 freedom panels off almost everyday and they still seal tight with no whistling or gaps. Everything is wearing good and extremely happy with the car. I may trade in for a 392 V8 Rubicon before those end production I just love this platform. If you are debating options get the upgraded audio because it’ll blow you away at how good it is, the navigation that comes with it is Also pretty good, the Mud terrain tires on the Willy’s package look great but can loose traction a bit more than a normal tire but opportunity cost for the great look and both safety groups are a must!",5,03/23/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"I liked the car a lot until the electric mode mostly quit on me. The dealer says that it goes into hybrid mode when it decides it needs fresh fuel or oil. It was recently serviced and had a recent fill up, so that makes no sense. To make matters worse the car will lurch into a low gear and won't recover until I stop the car and restart it. This has happened several times with me and my wife and it happened when the mechanic drove the car. Still, they are telling me that that is the way the car is engineered. That's dangerous and I'm dumbfounded. Has anyone else experienced the same behavior? What recourse do I have?",1,03/21/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
"This my 4th Jeep in a row, and the 2nd Renegade. No burning reason for trading in with only 68,000 mi. Maybe COVID boredom. I was so happy driving away in the new car... until it quit working after 10 miles. Had to be towed away by the dealer. My guess is the transmission failed. In spite of my years of loyalty, this experience makes me say I’ll never trust a Jeep again! So far, the dealership has been great, but I’ll have to wait and see what they offer to do about this. I want nothing to do with this car, even if it’s fixable. WTH!",1,03/20/2021,2023 Jeep Renegade
"After over 3300 miles and a major road trip I have to say this has been a flawless vehicle. Drives nice, features of the Summit reserve are spectacular. Mine has the V-8 which I would recommend if 18 mpg doesn't bother you as the power is just right and the V6 reviews show a lack of power and towing capability . The trim is high end, the conveniences especially the driver assist features with adaptive cruise, massaging 12 way adjustable seats were great on my road trip. Some of the reviews I read gave me some caution, but I've not experienced ANY issues, and I have almost all options available. Handling is excellent. Someone mentioned loose steering, but I find that hard to believe as it's firm and tight. Lighting is excellent at night, night vision is a nice feature, and visibility is good, Climate controls are nice and easily adjusted from either the buttons, or screen. This is a technology loaded vehicle so don't expect to learn it over night and if fingerprints on your screens bother you, might want to buy something from the old days. It will amaze you on what it can do after time. So many menus, and selectable features to figure out may be frustrating at first but after learning them, you will love it. One small thing I love is mine didn't have that stupid start/stop function, which in my Cadillac I had to disable every start as it's annoying. Seating is excellent and plenty of room. The McIntosh radio is excellent upgrade. Would I recommend this vehicle, absolutely but be patient on the learning what it can do.",5,03/19/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

"My G/F just bought a 2020 after her Rogue was totaled when a 15 year old in a 4x4 ran a stop sign. She shopped very little and didn't ask me for any help (mistake), so bought this Altitude thingy with zero off the asking price. IMO not worth it even if she had talked them down. For the money and the vehicle class there are far better values. The ride it harsh and the acceleration is awful. Very few amenities compared to the Rogue (and I'm not a fan of Nissan either), and just not there for the price. There's a difference between ""cheap"" and ""inexpensive"". This Jeep thingy is cheap. The Rogue was better built, rode better, had more features and was more efficient. But...she likes it and she's paying for it. Just don't expect great reviews because she did.

"We have owned our 4xe for about a month now, we bought it used with 6000 miles on it. After doing a lot of research on it before buying it, I was comfortable with purchase as it already had been driven 6000 miles trouble free. My wife primarily drives it because her commute to work is 3-5 miles one way, most days she is in full electric mode the whole time. So far we are still working on our first tank of fuel 600 miles in and averagin 28 mpg. As it is new to us and completely awesome, we have been driving it around on the weekends just enjoying the ride. Is it the most comfortable vehicle in the world? No, it is a Jeep, but the Rubicon fit and finish is very enjoyable. Would I have bought this if I had to commute on the highway every day, probably not.

I've been driving it around town for a few days now and am quite surprised by just how much fun it is to drive and live with. I am also fascinated that one could potentially strip this car bare using simple tools, and put it back together any way you want. I think it's an extremely competent vehicle for the money. Very thoughtful engineering throughout, and with a clear mission. Very happy with our purchase so far. Update: it is now my daily driver, and I'm loving it! Perfect for hopping around town, but not something I'd want to do a long trip in. Zero issues, 100% fun.",5,02/18/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"This jeep is perfect for the size that I wanted since trading in my Trax. It also has more power compared to my Trax. The interior is great and comfortable with the leather seats and right now it is winter and snowing so having good heat in the car is wonderful. The safety features are great all around. This Jeep has it all parking assist, lane assist, blind-spot monitoring, etc., and luxury on the inside. The technology that is in my Jeep is everything that I always wanted and more with a 360 camera, 10.1 touchscreen, rain-sensing windshield wipers, auto trunk liftgate. And let's not forget the color is beautiful, normally I get black cars but the crystal granite makes it beautiful with the all-blacked-out tires as well. I had nothing but Chevy and never thought about Jeep and loved my Trax and couldn't think that no other SUV but Chevy could excite me.

"I had my trailhawk for a few weeks before I noticed the hood rattling and lifting off the front stops while driving. I had to stop twice to make sure that the hood wasn't going to pop open . I went to the dealer the next day and their tech. looked at it and said that these composite hoods are extremely light and will appear to want to pop open but they won't because the secondary latch will catch it and if that fails, there is a kill switch that will turn the engine off. I don't know which is worse, having the hood pop open or having it pop open and no engine.

"I learned to drive in a 1954 CJ-3B on our farm. At 2200 lbs our little red jeep was nothing but the bare essentials. A simple 6volt electrical system lit the way. Most everything was mechanical except the lights. 72 Hp whisked you along. I bought the bright yellow 2021 80th edition Wrangler to have a vehicle to pull along behind our RV. I quickly found out it was not my father's jeep. Now grown to about 4000lbs, my jeep is fully loaded with all the tech that we have come to expect in a modern car like Apply play, adaptive cruise control, backup camera and all the rest. With a blast furnace heater, heated steering wheel and seats, it could easily serve as a year around daily driver. I'd guess the heat features were spaced to work on an open topless jeep because they really produce heat. Off the road, the jeep is, well, a jeep. The unstoppable go anywhere vehicle that earned Jeep its reputation. It's comfortable enough to cruise a highway but it's really at home off the road. You have to be careful on the road at higher speeds because it is a high vehicle with an off-the-road suspension that can be a challenge to handle. I don't recommend it for drivers that don't pay 100% attention 100% of the time. That said, it's fun to drive. I like the 2L turbo. It has good low end torque and revs up quickly. It has plenty of grunt when needed. In 6500 miles of driving I have had zero defects and no repairs needed. If you know what you're getting into a jeep can open up a whole new world of joy. No, it's nothing like that CJ-3B but true to the name, it rules off the road and adds a very modern high tech road vehicle to the mix,",5,01/29/2023,2022 Jeep Wrangler

"Bought my 2022 Compass Trailhawk in September 2022 from a Toronto Dodge Dealer. Within 3 weeks with less than 1000 km put on the vehicle after approximately 40 minutes of driving the volume of the radio would fade and eventually no sound would come from the speakers. I turned the vehicle off for about 10 minutes and turned it back on where the volume would come back. After 5 minutes it would again turn off where I couldnt not hear the radio, NAV or bluetooth. I took the vehicle to get looked at by the dealer multiple times where eventually the radio was replaced which didnt fix the issue. Took the vehicle back for a 4th time where I was told ""this is a KNOWN"" issue and the engineers are dealing with it back at Dodge. Basically I was told it is a software issue most likely related to the U Connect. I was then told my file is now closed and for me to contact Dodge/Jeep Home office which I did the same day. The call taker stated he does have other owners with the exact same problem but there is no ETA to when the issue will be resolved. So I am now stuck with a NEW vehicle that does not have sound which makes for a very boring travel into and out of work.

"I initially fell in love with this car. The thoughtful luxury interior Is absolutely beautiful. We bought the summit reserve for our large family of five. Our children are teenagers and play lacrosse and travel teams so we needed comfort style and fuel economy. We are moving from a 2002 Hummer H2 gas guzzling rust bucket and family 2012 Honda pilot touring that after 100k needs a new engine to a Honda Accord for my husband’s commute to work. After much research, deliberation and test driving ionic Hyundai, Mustang Mach e GT, Mazda CX-90 and the Grand Cherokee 4xe I decided on the Summit Reserve. Being a plug in electric meant that all my daily needs around town and schools would be met in the electric mode which allowed me to fill the gas tank just once a month if not going on a road trip I loved the fuel economy, and the luxury interior. The two-tone blacktop with blue body was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately early on and driving it it started to reveal that. The technology is not up to par. It started with different glitches in the electrical system error codes, beeps flashings, which sometimes cleared up or sometimes lasted for days the worst of it Was the three instances when while driving the engine turned off! This was incredibly dangerous as I was traveling with the children on a busy highway. The last two times this happened I happened to be alone, it died in the middle of the street and it required a tow back to the dealership where they gave me a loaner.

"First of all, I am motivated to chime in on the piano black interior. I love it. It looks high class and holds up way better than the fake plastic in other cars especially old jeeps. It is way better than my BMW 5 I had. Yes, I wipe it down often with the nice cloth provided. It is very satisfying and cleans up perfectly… and yes I have kids and yes I’ve used it for over a year… all is well. Why is everyone so worried about scratching it? What are they doing in there? Yes, dogs probably will scratch it but complaining about piano black scratches while the whole car is covered in hair and probably pee is… typical I guess. Second, I think jeep could do better with sound of the raspy engine. However, I have learned to drive the car to where I almost never hear it and I’m an aggressive driver. It has to do with the when and how you hit the accelerator in connection with the transmission. Not unlike me transitioning from a tundra to a 5 series before… people in 4xe forums say the car will learn your driving style but I think it’s the other way around. That said, this car has nearly 400hp! Smooth freeway drives with a full battery on sport mode are every bit as good as my bmw. Off the line it’s good but that’s where the raspiness can come in. I love to take the muddy way to baseball practice in my jeep and it pulls it off without a problem. Also, when people say this only gets 22mpg or so that is only if you never charge it. This car is built to run on both gas and electric power. I commute 30 miles to work 3x a week and my overall mpg is 30 after charging nightly. This SUV is fantastic, the electric X5 is probably better and it’s bothersome that their price is so close but I want a jeep! This thing is great! ",5,01/16/2024,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
"I am beyond upset! The Jeep Wrangler Unlimited has been on of me dream cars. So finally the High Altitude came out with Sky Touch. I said that’s it I’m buying one! 14,000 miles later, I hear a clicking noise every time I turned. My ball joints were torqued wrong. 56 compared to 70. Told everything is fine and good. 3 weeks later I have a severe death wobble on the highway. Luckily I was not hit by anyone. I finally came to a complete stop. The dealership told me the steering damper needed to be replaced. Yeah ok quick fix but under warranty ok. 1 week later squeaking on right front, now my right shock is bent from the death wobble. Another week later hear grinding, now my rotors need to be replaced. Another week later, there is squeaking in the back while tires are rotating. Well finally a few employees gave me the truth. Since 2020 Chrysler has been pushing vehicle out as fast a possible. Jeeps have become prettier with better features, but take the body off they are [non-permissible content removed] underneath. The cheapest parts you can find on a vehicle. It’s sad because they will ruin there reputation because of the [non-permissible content removed] production. I am still waiting for my vehicle back.

I have had this 4xe for a couple weeks and put 1500 miles on it. The exterior and interior are great and the ride is smooth. The engine needs more refinement because when it kicks on it sounds like a diesel . If you are looking at purchasing this SUV I wouldn’t recommend it if you drive to work hwy speeds. The battery would just be extra weight you are hauling around because the battery would be depleted quickly. If you are less than 25 miles from work and don’t go on the Hwy like myself and can charge at work it works out great. ,5,01/14/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe

Had this vehicle from brand new back in January 2021...it is now May 2023 and it has 45000 Kilometers on it..absolutely NO issues along the way except 2 cabin filter replacements when being serviced..I have a hairy dog!! Oil changes using synthetic oil are done at the dealership every 8000 kms. I live in Northern Ontario Canada and the Jeep handles beautifully in deep snow and on ice with winter Blizzaks on it....has always started at -35c and warms up quickly with heated seats and steering wheel and a great heater. No issues at all and I thoroughly recommend the Jeep... it has the 6 cyl engine and good gas mileage too...Cheers!!,5, 11/17/2023,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"It was a fun vehicle to drive, until it wasn't. I have owned 2 prior 2 door Wranglers previously. Purchased this one to order, and I received it in September 2020. Now only has 5k miles. It has not been driven off road, just on normal roads. Now all of a sudden, it needs constant correction, to drive STRAIGHT! Yes it was taken to the dealer twice, and the alignment checked, and other tweaks done, to which they didn't believe they fixed the problem. So we brought in Jeep Cares, the hope that they would care about their actual Customer. Especially a customer who has owned multiple Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler products over the years! So far we are back at the same dealer, who doesn't know what to do with it. Or knows exactly what is wrong, and it has sat on the lot for a week. So we talked to our Jeep Cares Rep, who called the dealer, whose response was to drive it to the other side of the parking lot to sit. So far our confidence has dropped in Jeep. If you want a Wrangler maybe you will get lucky, if you end up with one with a problem good luck! ",1, 08/26/2021,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"I've been one of lucky ones who have already received the new 392. What an absolutely incredible experience! I had an absolute visceral experience the first time I heard my new Jeep and then again the first time I pressed this pedal. Jeep took what was already an incredible vehicle and elevated it. The old saying of 'there is no replacement for displacement' can easily be applied to this Jeep. We loved my wife's 2020 Rubicon so much that when the 392 model came out I had to have it. If you're on the fence, get off and buy this Jeep. This is absolutely the best vehicle Jeep has ever produce. My only complaint is I wish they had upgrade the braking to the same level of the engine, but is nothing that would keep me from buying it.",5, 07/19/2021,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"I am just falling in love more every time I drive this wonder. Not a good gas saver as my 2020 sentra but definitely more fun. Wind noise on highway is not to bad, nice and smooth drive even when passing the train tracks, you don't have to slow down at all, nice! My only complain is the tiny nonsense, I would say ugly infotainment and instrument cluster vehicle information display on the Latitude LUX. It only display info on black and white. And the forward collision warning/stop device not working at all. It just displayed a massage saying sensor blocked, clean windshield. You got a be kidding me ??. Just brand new 2021. Already had an appointment for this issue. UPDATE: 2021 Cherokee latitude lux bought it brand new Dec.2020. with already 75k miles.

First my car had several recalls, and then my lane departure system continuously malfunctioned within the first few months of ownership. It took 3 months, 4 visits to two different Jeep service departments, 2 module replacements, and a new camera to “fix the issue”. Within months of repair, the lane departure malfunction happened again ???????. Now, not even a year into ownership and with only 7,000 miles on my vehicle, i have to have my transmission replaced due to an internal malfunction. Just when you think it couldn’t get any worse, they have no clue when they will get the transmission or the timeframe for repair. Can you say LEMON!?!

Bought a 2023 Jeep Compass thinking that buying a new car we would not have issues. Turns out that all we have had. Driving down the highway with no other cars around the cruise control randomly shuts off. At night the headlights will change from bright to dim with no on coming traffic. Wipers randomly start and you can shut them off. Engine sounds like it has a miss. When taken to the dealer for support they tell us it is functioning properly. They even told us the wipers and cruise control go off because of a blink sensor. I would not recommend any Jeep product to anyone as they are unsafe and dealers do not know how to asses them for issues. ,1,01/05/2024,2024 Jeep Compass
"I’ve had zero concerns with my Sahara 4xe after 13k miles. It has all the non-drivetrain DIY improvements you can make on all Wranglers. I keep the roof and doors off from May-October and I get about 27 miles of pure electricity on a charge. The engine sounds pretty rough the first 10k, but with the oil change it starts to sound a bit better. Much quieter than my ‘17 Sahara. For long trips it isn’t going to get even decent gas mileage, but for the daily driver you can really cut back on gas consumption. The OEM Bridgestone Duelers tires aren’t anything special and I would recommend getting a more rugged set if you are doing anything more than gravel. The concerns I had when I got it in August ‘22 were reports of the wrangler 4xe suddenly turning off while driving. This turned out to be a decent amount of cars with loose fuses. I checked mine and there were probably 10 or so loose (not good!) about a week after purchase. They’ve stayed in place since then. Another big concern that people would mention was a F.O.R.M. Notification. This meant that the car would not turn off the engine even when the battery was full. This primarily occurred when the gas would start to degrade (I’ve gone more than 5 weeks at a time without filling up even a 1/4 tank), or regular oil service was due and the oil was past prime. Getting the oil service would clear it and expending all but an 1/8 of a tank then refilling it would clear the other FORM notification. ",5,01/04/2024,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"This is the first brand new SUV I have bought. While I was a bit skeptical about getting brand new, I'm glad I did. There were a couple of glitches in the beginning, like the passenger side mirror didn't close when I locked it and the sensor for the back lift gate didn't register, however after driving it around for a bit those issues seemed to correct themselves. This is not my daily driver, more of a weekend vehicle. I am quite pleased with the features it has, such as the massage seats and the TVs in back can have 2 different shows at once. No grandkids yet but when I do this will be a nice feature. ",5,01/03/2024,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

"Turned in my 2020 Limited X when the lease was up, and decided to go with 2023 4XE simply because the EV tax incentive brought my monthly payments down significantly versus staying with a traditional Limited model. (note: the dealer took the incentive amount off of the sticker price but I understand that is not the case with all dealerships!) Not one month into leasing, my engine light comes on and my roof begins to leak inside the car after a rain storm. Brought it back to the dealership - after 10 days they said they couldn't find the problem with the roof and said my coolant was low which is what caused the light to go on. Shortly after picking my car up from repair I experienced a random down-shift one day while driving to work, which was extremely dangerous given I was on an expressway. The only way I could get back to driving was to turn it off and restart it! Last night we had another heavy rainstorm in the Northeast. Surprise.. it was also raining in my car again. Called the dealership and will now need to bring it back to be looked at again. Unbelievable. My 2020 Limited X was so reliable, well-made, and I never had one single issue with it in the 42 months I leased it. I can't believe Jeep has a $60K+ tag on this particular vehicle because it's quality so far doesn't match up with that number. My sister drives a 2022 base model Compass and has had nothing but an amazing owner experience this far. Pros and Cons to Jeep Grand Cherokee xe (based on under two months in my possession) Pros : Sleek interior Nicely upgraded technology Beautiful exterior Comfortable cabin Quiet driving experience in electric mode Cons: Loud 4 cyl engine, esp when battery charge runs out Sluggish Experience of leaking roof, engine light, and near stall Key fob not always reliable Longer front hood with no front park sense feature If I could go back to two months ago, I would have chosen a different vehicle.

"We have owned many Jeeps over the years. My favorite is our 2020 Rubicon unlimited. Anyways we purchased a new 2023 Jeep Compass Latitude Lux 2 weeks ago. A week into ownership it throws a service transmission code. I took it in to the dealership to have it repaired. They said it's a bad transmission control module. They ordered a replacement, which Chrysler cancelled. Told them to reinstall the original TCM and drive it 40 miles. If it doesn't throw the code again, give it back to customer. I'm sorry but this is not acceptable. I will not trust this vehicle anymore. Only 280 miles on it. This vehicle was purchased as a daily driver and for long trips to save fuel. Needless to say we will not drive it on long trips, since it can't be trusted. The TCM should have been replaced.

"Once again, electric range is great for our needs. We've filled this car 3 times in the last 7 months. Unfortunately, the issues reported below persist and new ones have appeared - all with the infotainment system. I recently had all of the software updated, but it didn't eliminate the issues: 1) occasionally a VERY loud buzzing sound and *boom* - the entire system reboots. 2) Sometimes when parking and getting back in after just a few minutes, the system 'loads' for several minutes. Other times, everything is fine. 3) After the software updates the blinker speed is now about 1/3 normal. Apparently this requires a Stellantis tech to reprogram it and my dealer isn't making this a priority 4) The TPMS issue is apparently a big one and there is a STAR case open to resolve it 5) Occasionally the heads-up info configuration changes. This gets fixed when restarting the car. So...while the driving and comfort is still nice, these nagging issues significantly take away from the ownership experience. I have a hard time being okay with these (and the lack of fixes/updates) on a $75K vehicle and think back to my tech-heavy X5 which was a much more satisfying experience. At this price point I will switch from Jeep unless they make big improvements in this area. Update 2/2/23: *** After owning the GC 4xe for 6 weeks I'm pleased to find the electric range still meets our needs. With normal driving I can get 26-28 miles from the battery. We put around 700 miles on 1/2 tank of gas and have still not filled up :) After living with it a while here are my biggest complaints...the 4 cyl engine is NOT refined. It's quite loud and thrashy and is very noticeable when it kicks on. Once cruising at highway speeds its fine though. The car assigns profiles to the memory seat 1 and 2 positions. When switching a profile it switches everything: map destinations, seats, radio presets, etc... Unfortunately this effectively reboots everything. That means the widgets reload, the TomTom map restarts, the stereo restarts, etc... which takes several minutes! Imagine driving somewhere with navigation, hitting the memory seat button, and everything reboots...not good! I'd like to save all settings and only have the seat readjust with button #2. From what I can tell, not possible. Still getting the TPMS fault on startup which requires adjusting the cluster screen. The HVAC system seems to trigger on at a high (and loud) setting...would like to see more subtle management of the automatic climate control. Most of those items are annoyances that I can adapt to but as mentioned below, not what I would expect to deal with on a $75K vehicle. So my biggest complaint remains the luxury pricing without the luxury experience. Loaded with options, this is an excellent $60-65K vehicle. **** I bought a 2015 GC Summit for $48K, so the idea of a $75K Overland was difficult to say the least. This is BMW/Mercedes/Land Rover territory. In fact I came from a loaded X5 that I really enjoyed but was leery of owning out of warranty. I drove the standard GC and the powertrain is just too outdated, couldn't compete with the twin turbo V6 in the X5. The Jeeps 375 HP PHEV powertrain made it compelling though. With a true 25 miles of electric range the GC meets our needs for daily driving on electric. Stomp the pedal and it scoots close to X5 performance. The interior is luxurious but a bit buggy. I assume this will improve with software updates. Seats are very comfortable, McIntosh is great, and the overall tech is great. I thought the night vision was gimmicky until testing it on a dark street and it highlighted a person walking that I couldn't see. Definitely has value in certain situations! Several weird things though like the passenger screen can control FM stations but not Sirius, the TPMS system faults at startup until you start driving. Not a big deal but the warning message stays up so I have to cycle through cluster screens to get back to the right view. The heads up display nav instructions are tiny. It's hard to read street names and the text cuts off. They should have designed the HUD like BMW as one big screen instead of assigning content to small quadrants of the HUD. Massage and seat cooling works very well. Adaptive cruise and lane keeping is solid. Quiet ride with excellent suspension. So far I'm enjoying the GC and got this on a lease since they were including the full EV credit to reduce the cap cost. Take away the credit and I'd likely go for the X5 PHEV if it was a dollar for dollar comparison. Why? Feature-wise it compares well against the luxury brands, has off-road capability, and includes 3 years of maintenance. Overall I feel the GC 4xe is very good at a discount. Jeep really needs to rein in the sticker price or up the ante with what they offer though. For example, the Pentastar V6 is an old powertrain...why not offer the new Hurricane 6? Why is the destination charge hundreds more than other makes when this is coming from Detroit? Why only a 3 year warranty when luxury makes are 4 or even 5 years? Why do I only get a 3 month 'trial' of connected services on a $75K vehicle? If Jeep wants play at this price point they need to up the offering. I jumped on this car in 2015 for $48K and hesitantly got this 2022 at a discount. Though I'm enjoying the GC this is priced squarely in luxury territory and faces serious competition.",4,07/11/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
"TL;DR-Mom loves it, Dad loves it, the kids love it. For those who want the full version, here we go. Mom and Dads who need the 3rd row but don’t want to drop $85k on a bloated Tahoe or, and more importantly, can’t bring themselves down to the minivan, hear me! Btw if you’re reading this and don’t have kids get out of here, why are you even here? The regular grand Cherokee will haul your dogs just fine, this is ours. We had a 2018 grand Cherokee from our 1 child days, back when one kids crap could fit into anything. Fast forward to today, the crotch goblins have doubled and so has the required supplies. One faces forward and can grab the back of my neck while I’m driving. The other one faces backwards so I can’t see what the heck it’s doing, but it’s usually trying to choke on something. Add my tired (but still beautiful) wife to the passenger seat, and it’s a tight ride. We rented a 2023 Durango R/T for a week and took a road trip to Disneyland, because we apparently hate our sanity. The Durango was a godsend (I swear I’m gonna get to the Jeep). All the room we could ever need. The oldest was banished to the 3rd row, the 2nd row captains chairs allowed my wife to comfortably sit in the back and soothe the demon spawn. And there was plenty of room for all the junk that had to come with. It was amazing. We got back home and put the car seats back in the 2018. The next day we went car hunting. Once you have a taste of the 6 year old not being within its arms reach you can’t go back. Durango was #1 on our list, but the Kia Telluride had better reviews. Drove the Kia, felt small and cheap. It felt like it was a minivan pretending not to be a minivan. I don’t know where all the hype came from, I didn’t see it. Especially when I got torque steer during the test drive (not insulting intelligence, but that’s when you give a front wheel drive car the beans and it pulls to the right). You want $50k for a front wheel drive imposter SUV? Nah We have a Jeep. We like the Jeep. Jeep saved wife’s life when she got t-boned. Let’s go look at a Jeep. We made it. Enter the 2023 Grand Cherokee L. There was one Jeep with 2nd row bucket seats (wife only wanted the bucket seat). It’s a limited 4x4 in a blackish browish green kinda color. It’s actually beautiful. And inside is even better. 3rd row for permanent exhale for the 6 year old. Heck, I, a 6-00 200lbs man fit comfortably. Baby cam to watch the other terrorist. 10 inch TVs in the back of the front row seats that you can monitor on the whatever inch gigantic screen up front. 4x4 so I still feel like a man, and can actually go places with decent ground clearance. When it’s not in 4wd, it’s rear wheel drive, like god intended. The interior is just beautiful, and it’s comfortable to drive. No, it’s not gonna win any races, if you want speed get the Durango, which isn’t even that fast anyways. Your speed days are done regardless, so who cares. It still gets up and goes better than a 4Runner so good there. I’ve put a few hundred miles on it, so far none of the day 1/week 1 problems. I love this Jeep, I think they nailed it. I’ll do an update in 6 months or so, or if any problems arise. Thanks for reading my 1700 word wish.com version of Ted talk. ",5,06/11/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L

"I love my new Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit Reserve extended. Purchased it in the fall of 2022. On December 26th 2022, I was backed into in a parking lot. Both passenger doors need to be replaced. The body shop and the Jeep Dealership that has ordered the parts but cannot get the doors (backordered), and Jeep is not even giving a date when they will be available. Very frustrating. If you are going to provide a new body style, then should there not be parts available to repair a vehicle. I have essentially a brand new vehicle that cannot be repaired. Love the brand, am very disappointed in Jeep part practices. I have also had similar issues with the radio system. It is always acting up in different ways.

I bought my 4xe on December 7th 2022. On the way to work on the 9th it died at a red light and said service transmission soon. It started back up and I took it to the dealership I bought it from. They pulled the code and test drove it and said they couldn’t find any issues but if it happened again to bring it back in. On December 10th I was at a light again and it died only this time it would not restart. Roadside was going to take 2 hours and the police gave me 2 choices. 1. Tow at my own expense 2. Have it impounded and pay the impound fee. I went with option 1. It took almost 2 weeks for the Stellantis engineers to determine my car with 122 miles needs a new transmission and it would be another 6-8 weeks before I got my car back.

"I was looking for a new daily commuter that I would pass down to the kid in a few years and ended up going with the Compass after test driving just about everything in the subcompact SUV class. I almost dismissed it due to some of the mediocre reviews I had read but I honestly believe these reviews are spill-over from previous generations. Im not saying the Compass is the best thing on the market but it is way better than half the SUV’s that are consistently ranked higher than it. The Compass wins in looks compared to almost every other subcompact and now that it has the new 2.0T and 8speed it performs just as well. There were other subcompacts that I liked better in certain areas but the Compass was the best well-rounded pick. The Mazda CX-5 2.5Turbo was the better performance vehicle but the interior was outdated and the infotainment system was not good. The Dodge Hornet GT plus looked amazing and drove great but there was minimal technology and I couldn’t find one with leather. The Rav4 TRD Off-Road had a mean rugged look but everything else about it was lackluster. The Honda CR-V checked a lot of boxes for me (ie. Safety, space, MPG’s, etc.) but the Compass felt better. Pros: • Exterior design looks great, it literally is a small Grand Cherokee. • Interior design and materials are top-notch. • New engine and transmission make it a completely new Compass. • Tons of tech and safety features. Cons: • $$$$ My Compass (High Altitude w/ Driver Assistance and Elite packages) was $44K… that’s Grand Cherokee / Wrangler prices! • I didn’t notice it until I read this review but there is a significant amount of engine noise in the cabin although the Alpines take care of that. • Engine is better but wish they could’ve squeezed 25-50 more horsepower out of it. • It is on the smaller side of it’s class.",4,06/08/2023,2024 Jeep Compass
Ive had mine for 3 weeks now .Loveit! easy to get in and out of prior car owner all of my life . Took this baby on a florida road trip no issues at all. especially of the 275. It was ready for challenge. Highly recommend,5,03/08/2023,2024 Jeep Compass
Just bought on Monday it’s amazing so far don’t let people tell you it’s too small I’m 6’4 and have to scoot the seat up to reach the peddles it’s bigger on the inside than it looks. The backseat is comfortable and easy to get out of for my older parents (60-70) one rides up front. The turbo is amazing and I’m getting 27 mpg. I got the billet silver which changes color almost depending on angle you look at love it. The interior is black leather and those seats are so comfy I’m looking forward to driving from Alabama to Florida in the summer ,5,12/07/2023,2024 Jeep Compass

"Over all i love my Jeep but i have complained to the dealership about the dashboard lighting during the day not lighting up enough so i can see my gas gage, speed, and etc..., they told me there should be an update to the Uconnect system soon well that's been 3 months ago. I haven't heard anything since. I looked into recalls but no luck there either, i will be contacting Jeep headquarters today to see what we are doing to fix this issues because it is very inconvenient when you cant see your gas gage. Anyone else with this issue had it resolved? ",4,03/07/2023,2024 Jeep Compass
"I am very pleased with my Compass Trailhawk. I have had it for 7 months and it has been outstanding. One concern I had about the 2.4 multiair engine is oul consumption but my Jeep has not had that issue. In fact, I drove from south Florida to Northern California and have not used a drop of oil. I check every fill up and it is still at the top mark on the stick. I have changed oil religiously and only use 0w-20 Mobil 1 and I have no complaints. The Jeep has a great ride, many safety features and a nice stereo. I am very happy with the vehicle overall. I would recommend this SUV for anyone.",5,01/07/2023,2024 Jeep Compass
"The 4xe is our third new Grand Cherokee in four years. We had a 2019, 2021 and the new 2022. We put 38,000 miles on the 2019; 73,000 miles on the 2021, and so far, 14,000 miles on the 4xe. Everything considered, we'd take the older models. First, the positive. Overall it's a lovely vehicle - - - comfortable, roomy and silver smooth going down the highway. The exterior finish is impeccable and the sheet metal fits flawlessly. All electric is quiet, smooth and responsive. And then there's the negative. (1) Engine noise. The worst is the engine noise in the standard 4 cylinder. At times it sounds like a mad bumblebee and at others it's as silent as the desert at midnight. IMO there's no excuse for Jeep to install an engine in a $70K vehicle which sounds like it's ready to explode at any moment. This is pure, plain unacceptable. (2) Center console finish. Next is the black plastic coating on the center console, etc. Cheap, cheap, cheap! For fear of scratching the finish, as soon as we brought the car home we covered the finish with blue 3M masking tape. In our previous models, the center console area had a metallic like finish which was much superior. Why change a good thing? (3) Instrument cluster. The instrument cluster has 20+ bits of information, ranging from the vehicle speed to the mileage range in both gas and electric to the average mpg to the total range to the percent of electric charge available. In short, it's information overload. (4) Lack of tachometer. Where's the tachometer when driving in engine only mode? (5) Engine idle. While in Florida, we met some folks at an Elks Lodge. The outside temperature was 90 deg. Our dog was with us. We left the vehicle running in ""engine only"" mode with the air conditioning set at 68 degrees. A few minutes later, THE ENGINE STOPPED RUNNING!!!!!!!! People were alarmed and advised us that the dog was in the car and seemed distressed. I immediately went outside and started the car again, only to have it stop again a few minutes later. In 50 years of driving, I have never had this happen previously. JEEP, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??????? I have a call into Jeep, but a week later they have yet to get back to me. (6) Shifting from park. I have remarked to my wife that this Jeep would not make a good getaway car. Sometimes it doesn't want to shift from Park to Drive or to Reverse in anything resembling a timely manner. There are other issues, but I don't want this review to become too long. The one thing I would add, however, is that Jeep needs to decide who their customers are and why people want to buy the Grand Cherokee. The thing has become too ""refined."" It's a JEEP!!! If I wanted a BMW or Land Rover, I'd buy one. And all the talk about what a wonderful off-road vehicle it is - - - who cares? How many people spend $70K and then go off-roading over a mountain pass trail, across rivers, over boulders and careening through the snow? We will be looking for a new SUV in the next year. Will it be another 4xe or any other Jeep? At this point, we just don't know.",3,05/06/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
"Yes, it looks nice. Yes, it is lovely when working in electric mode. Yes I've owned Jeep before (my 4th Grand Cherokee) but WTH is with this hybrid battery life??? Cant even get to work without draining (17 miles) Charger is awful unless you upgrade to a 240V - but even then - you can't exactly take the charger with you because noone has the requisite socket. Once the car switches to gas mode - you're talking about a 4 cylinder with a heavier payload (due to 500lb EV battery), no pulling power, noise that'll make you think the transmission is shot and overall awful performance. I tried to give the car back 3 days after purchase - trade it for a Gr Cher limited - but was told no go. Not surprising. Anyone who gave a positive review is either lying, a bot, or hasnt driven this thing long enough",1,12/05/2023,2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe
It has all the bells and whistles and definitely has some spunk. The customizable dashboard panel is very handy. The ventilated seats for summer are a must have! ,5,11/05/2023,2024 Jeep Compass
I love everything about this car. It’s beautifully designed on the inside. Too many of these cars are black and dark and just ugly inside. The gray material is so classy. I’ve had it for a year and my only complaint is that I wish it did not have the self charging pad. We could use that space to put keys etc. They suggest putting keys there could damage the fob. My iPhone Otterbox case prevents it from charging anyway. I must also add that we bought the car brand new and after 1500 miles it started burning oil. The dealership replaced the entire engine immediately and we have had not a problem since. You know I must like it after that experience. I told my husband I still wanted another one just like it!,5,10/05/2023,2024 Jeep Compass
"Ran out of gas twice when displaying over 100 more miles of range. Dealership couldn't find the problem with their computer diagnostics, so officially the problem doesn't exist. Lemon lawyer said the same, if the dealership equipment cannot identify the problem, ""There is no president established and you're stuck."" Thank the Lord I bought it at a low price (less than 900 miles used). So, I felt guilty but I had to take it to Carmax. It was too risky and the electronics acted weird at times too. Plus the ride and noise isolation were subpar for this price point. Panoramic Sunroof was nice. This vehicle will wreck your life.. though. Gotta love the pro reviewers who drive car for 2-7 days and give a glowing report though! Ps: Seems the Wagoneer is cut from the same mold as well, glitchy and iffy everywhere.

"well I must say I am rather impressed with the technology and work Stellantis put into the Grand Cherokee L . My last vehicle was a 2017 DDRT which is a wonderful vehicle as well, however I had to try the GCL because it is such a Handsome Vehicle. I am glad I made the switch. Smooth ride on the Grand Cherokee L Limited with the luxury package. Its the change I was looking for in a vehicle. I've had it for 3 weeks now ,I have no complaints concerning the way it handles. It actually feels high end in the SUV arena. If you are thinking about one you must take the test drive.

"We actually have two of these - a highlighter yellow 2023 and a black 2022. Unlike many of these reviewers, we actually started with full EVs (Kia Niro and Mini Cooper SE) and backed down to plug in hybrids after one too many Electrify America close calls. They are more comfortable and efficient for short trips than the Jeep wrangler ecodiesel we traded in, but the ecodiesel ruled on highway trips with an average of 32 mpg (the best we can get with either 4xe is 23 mpg when appropriately using esave mode). We have had 0 mechanical or software issues. Why do we have 2? My job has fca affiliate pricing as a benefit, at the time of purchase both jeeps had full $7500 tax credits attached, and the 2022 was a hugely discounted leftover with the exact colors my wife wanted (and I didn’t). So far neither have had any issues at all, although I do wish they had had the upgraded icdm that allows V2L like our F150. One thing I’d like to correct in many of the other reviews is that they are full hybrids - there is 17kwhr-ish lithium battery, which includes the protective buffer, the hybrid partition, and the portion of the battery you can access in hybrid/electric mode. Just because you exhaust the electric range doesn’t mean the hybrid partition is empty too - you can demonstrate this every time you coast to a stop at a stop light and the engine turns off while you coast in and then stays off while you sit there. You have the full 375 HP all the time, whether your battery says empty or not. Our F150 hybrid only has a 1.5 kwhr battery all the time, which is probably the same size as the 4xe partition. So does a Prius. We’ve always had at least one Jeep (we live in Arkansas, so it’s written into the county codes here that you must). If you plug in every couple of days (yes we have a level 2 charger at home from our EVs), you can go 800-1000 miles easily on a tank with short work commutes - literally the Jeep will make you use gas so it doesn’t go bad. One hidden downside of this is that your maintenance costs are exaggerated- every time you change the oil, the oil only has about a thousand miles on it. We will sell off one of these next year to get another tax credit (probably Tesla, but we’ll see), but if you love jeeps (and paying less taxes) and commute less than 25 miles to work then the math can be in your favor.",5,09/04/2023,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"First off, it was hard letting go of my Kia Stinger GT2. It was a great dad car: dogs loved it, hatch was spacious, and fit a child seat no problem. This issue was fitting all of it plus another 2 humans. Couldn’t take the dogs and the kid at the same time. Trading it was rough. But my dogs, two kids, and gf love the L. Got the Altitude model in all black with everything stock and then added side steps and more tint. Went with this over the others (Telluride, Palisade) because of the offers and over the Durango and Traverse since those are very outdated. Exterior Looks: 8/10. It’s a dad SUV Interior looks: 7/10. Glossy black is terrible and the all black trim leaves the interior very cave like. The higher trim two tone dash is nicer, but the button layout and screens are nice and responsive. Wireless charger works well. Lots of vents in the rear. Child seat fits easily in the 3rd row but the 17 year old likes it back there more than the middle so he’s happy and has plenty of space. Power: 7/10: V6 isn’t nearly as fun as the Turbo Stinger but for the city it’s just fine Refinement: 7.5/10: quiet but the models without air suspension are pretty rough. Just remind yourself it’s a Jeep not a Cadillac Cargo: 9/10: huge. Tailgate opens fast and high too Value: 8/10: Wish the 2023 got the Hurricane engine and the better/smoother ZF transmission since it can be pretty jerky switching gears. Other than that I have no complaints. It’s an easy choice for a manly, non-minivan, dad mobile that won’t win races, doesn’t have drift mode, but will make everyone happy. I also disagree with the site regarding visibility. I can see perfectly fine out every window and the large hood is awesome, not a hindrance. The buttons are also easy to use and not confusing at all. ",4,07/04/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L
"I leased this new about two months ago. As the dealer continued to assure me the MPGe was accurate and I would get 56 mpg for 100 miles of driving, I knew that wouldn’t be the case unless under the perfect conditions. Nonetheless, I was hoping for in the 30s regularly. This hasn’t necessarily been the case. The hybrid setting heavily favors the electric motor than the gas, so unless you plan on driving 30 miles or less regularly, you will drain the battery and run on the gas motor, getting 21 mpg for the remainder of the trip. The car has a lot of technology and is extremely comfortable. When driving full electric, it is quiet and smooth, but when using the gas, especially in colder conditions, the car tends to whine and lack acceleration. So much to the point that I am considering a trip to the Jeep dealer because it doesn’t seem right, despite only 1200 miles on the car. Regarding the 4x4, I buy Jeep because living in NY state in the winter, you can’t find a better car for a very snowy day. However, this is the first that I have owned that has a button vs. a shift for 4x4 and adjusts “automatically” as needed. In a few inches of snow, this Jeep slides far more than any of the 4 previous Jeep I owned that had a shift. Jeep UConnect has issues where the screen will just go black. It’s not affecting anything, but seems concerning. I had this one black out and cut all functionality and reboot mid drive. This used to happen on my Wrangler weekly. I was hoping it was due to it being newer tech in 2018 or that a Wrangler is not really known for the technology, but it apparently is just something with UConnect, unless I’m just the unlucky one with two lemons in that area. All in all, it’s beautiful, comfortable with a lot of technology, but unless you drive under 30 miles a day, you’re not really saving any money because your mpg may be high 20s to 30 mpg, but a full charge will also cost about $2.50, which needs to be considered. These models cost $15k more than the Grand Cherokees, and you will not be saving that in return because it’s a PHeV. The acceleration may be specific to mine, but something to consider prior to dropping $65k on a car. There are others out there that could provide more value and consistency for that price tag.

"Mine is a 2023 Grand Cherokee L. I will start with the negatives. The 3.6 L V6 is adequate. The Uconnect system randomly reboots itself while driving. This is a nitpick, but the doors feel hollow when you close them. The positives: The Limited L comes standard with Captain’s Chairs, and my two kids love those seats, The transmission is great, making up for the just adequate V6. The front seats are incredibly comfortable over long distances. The Limited comes with front and rear heated seats, and a heated steering wheel. Unlike most other SUVs, there’s no giant display sticking up from the dash. The display is elegantly integrated into the center of the dash. The chassis feels very solid, with no flex when driving over railroad tracks or rough roads. All three rows have air vents, and USB A and C slots. The second row has its own HVAC controls.",4,12/03/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L
"I would like to say that I love this Jeep, but it has been nothing but problems. The sensors keep malfunctioning. I have had it back to the dealer 3 times and they still don't know what is wrong. At night the interior dash and screen lights flash bright and dim continuously. Somehow Jeep does not see this as a ""safety"" concern so they won't rent me a car now. I have to continually adjust the windshield wipers while I'm driving in the rain because the automated system slows down when it rains too hard. My Jeep only has 5000 miles on it.

Speakers making a weird sound when you have the base on. It has no power to lift off or when you trying to pass someone. Very stiff on bumps even the small ones. It’s only 10 months old, I tried to get rid of it and the value dropped down dramatically from 83k to 50k within 10 months.

"When we bought the Jeep, we were in a financial bind due to our newborn being in the hospital for 7 months. We needed a quick fix, which was to get rid of the vehicle we had to get back GAP money, etc. to help us out. We told the salesman that even though we needed a quick fix, we needed a cheaper note and a reliable vehicle for our family. This vehicle is NOT reliable in any way. For starters, we have had automatic windshield wiper issues from day one. The wipers don't work when it rains and will turn on when it isn't raining. We have brought it back with those concerns, and the problem was ""fixed""... it was not. I have tried making other appointments about this issue but they are swamped and never have an appointment time that we can make (we have jobs). They also never have a rental car for us to use but expect to hold my vehicle overnight. How do they expect a working family to get everyone where they need to be without a vehicle? Other issues that make this vehicle unsafe and unreliable for my family is: -the automatic start doesn't work (it is 104 degrees in Louisiana and my 1 year old cannot get in a vehicle that hot) -The keyless entry works when it feels like it. (I had to put my one year old on the ground in the parking lot of walmart, along with my groceries, to find my keys and open the door. In this environment, that is NOT safe and not okay.) *Both if the previous complaints have been shown to other car salesmen and they could not figure out why it wasn't working. -The air vent system is a design fault. (my one year old son, who is in a rear facing carseat, has to have two fans attached to his seat to feel any air. The vents are in front of his seat. With the vehicle only having one blower motor, it is as if it doesn't have the capability to cool the entire vehicle. We have had to put growing our family on hold because I WILL NOT have an infant die of SIDS because it gets too hot in the vehicle.) -The front,center lights have to be pushed 4-5 times for them to decide they will stay on. I have pushed them on to try and find something and while looking for it, they turn off. This is not okay. -the liftgate will malfunction from time-to-time, where it decides it will not open. Even when the keys are present, it will not open. -On top of the tech system freezing up all of the time and us being told that it is just ""an update issue""... For a vehicle at this price, we should NOT have these issues. We fill as if we were taken advantage of at a low point in our lives for them to profit off of our tahoe, and give us a piece of crap vehicle. If I wasn't paying for all of these things, then it would be understandable for me to have a car with issues, but that is not the case. We are ultimately frustrated with the vehicle and the dealership.",1,10/03/2023,2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee L
"Excellent new rig from Jeep. By keeping it in hybrid most of the time I'm averaging 26mpg in city and 30+mpg highway - a major improvement over my old gas powered TJ and JK rigs with their average of 13 mpg on a good day. Engine doesn't feel like I've traded any power for this efficiency, which is fantastic. It took a bit to get used to how the engine sounds, but that's a me problem. You're not going to get that big, powerful Jeep rumble with a PHEV. So far it's been a dream on light trails and on the beach, as well. I haven't tested the towing capacity yet, but expect it will handle my trailer just fine. We have a lot of mixed terrain and slick weather where I live and the Jeep has been stable to drive: hugging the pavement when it's icy, surefooted in snow, good traction in wet sand, and solid on rain-slicked winter roads. It hasn't given me any problems on hills at all, though the real test will be when I go over the pass for the first time. I expect it will handle that well also. One aspect of having a PHEV Jeep that I find delightful is the ability to put it in esave mode and then run on electric once I reach the trailhead. It's been a pleasure to do some light off roading in relative quiet and actually hear nature instead of a loud engine. There is a tradeoff in my gas use efficiency when I do that, of course, but it's worth it. Just like my standard shift Jeeps, I expect choosing the correct dealer is going to make a difference with these Jeeps going forward. With my stick shift TJ and JK, finding a dealer in this decade that still understood stick shifts and their quirks was essential. Now I think finding a dealer that understands the combined complexities of a hybrid engine and a rig built for off road use will be key to owner happiness. My only personal gripe with this Jeep so far has nothing to do with the rig - it's that I detest the color blue ;) Happily, a quick de-badging session this summer when it's not so cold will take care of that. My only broad gripe with this Jeep is the price point! This Rubicon feels like it would be more appropriately priced in the $50K range new but I see it being sold as high as $80K in some areas. Overall, 10/10, absolutely pleased with my purchase. Can't wait to see how the models continue to improve and innovate as Jeep gets more time in the electric vehicle space.",4,02/03/2023,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"At first, this was an amazing vehicle; then within two (2) months of owning it, the Infotainment System went completely black while on a trip with my daughter. Took us a while, but after looking at YouTube videos in the middle of a gas station parking lot in another state...we did a hard/factory reset and the system came back on. Made dealership aware, they ""updated"" the system and told us that it was fixed. Problem continued and even after sending video to dealership, they still would not fix it because they ""could not duplicate it"" in the garage. Taking the Jeep into the dealership for the 3rd time with the same issue, we were able to show them what happens; after the dealership representative tried multiple times to get the screen to come on, she was shown how to do the factory reset and the screen came on. NOW they say they will replace it... Also, kept hearing a knocking sound when the vehicle was in idle; took it to Dealership and was advised that the water pump needed to be replaced, yet so did a gasket. That has been completed. We're still waiting on a new Infotainment System, and now the knocking is back, and we've not even driven it more than 50mi since the replacement.

On multiple occasions driving on the highway it will start shaking for no reason as if we were going down a gravel road. Also for an electric vehicle it's actually really loud.

"We purchase the grand Cherokee Summit Reserve 4XE. It has tremendous. Curb appeal and high end finishes inside. The McIntosh system pushes It over the top along th the night vision and auto elevation. Driving for fuel efficiency takes some learning. Also you will receive a level II charger at home. I you morning errands under 30 miles total, return home for lunch and charge for two hours, you can knock out afternoon miles and barely use ANY gasoline. For my driving (less than 50 miles per day), I’m only using one tank of gas (18 gallons) ever six weeks. With intermediate level 2 charging in the middle of the day, I’m killing the statistics on fuel efficiency. However, long trips are a real game change. I’d you venture further than 13 miles from home for your average trip, you will burn significantly more fuel. It will drag down your fuel efficiency something serious. Will you save money on fuel? That depends on your reference. For a big substantial SUV it does ok. Better than a gas version by far. But e price is way too high to save money in most instances. Factor in the cost of a Level 2 charger and it will take a long ti for most peopl to recover the added cost of the EV power plant. Just going to close by saying I love this SUV.

Writing to the CEO, the new guy that wants just battery powered Jeeps on the road and is concentrating more on China and other markets vs. the United States - so do not see it going very far with him. Trying to write Attorney General's office, BBB, who knows, anyone who might even care about the life of a teenage (responsible) driver driving a unreliable Jeep at night from work. I'm at a loss that these in the service departments are avoiding the Transmission and Powertrain warnings so this time around, I am not budging. I'm going to start a Jeep instagram relaying the story of the uncaring way they are sluffing off this dangerous experience - I'm horrified and wonder why I keep supporting ""American"" products. I bought NEW so I would not have to worry about service, safety or reliability - Jeep proved me wrong as are each service department within the Phoenix metropolitan area. Frustrating for certain. Looking into Lemon Law, Lawyers, justice courts as this is ridiculous. Suggestions? Anyone experience this? If so, please direct me to what you are doing. ",1,09/12/2022,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"I love my Jeep! It’s roomy, solid body, and has back up camera! I have the soft top. I love that I can push it back to the second roll bar by myself. The ride is much smoother than older models.

Purchased a 2022 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk in May of 2022. Vehicle is fine .. my 7th Jeep. OEM Firestone Destination AT tires are extremely loud. Under 40 mph sounds like a Leer jet landing. Since they are original equipment neither Firestone nor the dealer would do anything since they were not “defective”. I’ll probably have to pay myself to replace these tires since the road noise at times is unbearable. Only 3000 miles on the car. Pay close attention to road noise before buying a vehicle with these tires.,4,07/11/2022,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"So far so good. I like the way the seat kind of wraps around me. It is comfortable. Everything is easily accessible in my field of view or within my grasp. This Jeep has some zip to it. I only wish it had the option of turbo or something but alas it has that lumber that a Jeep has. Overall, I am enjoying the experience. ",4,01/11/2022,2024 Jeep Compass

"I've had mine for 4 weeks and just put gas in it for the first time. The all electric mode in town is perfect for me. Most of my daily commuting is 12-16 miles. I pay attention to keeping it charged which is more enjoyable than always paying at the pump. The 375hp/470 lbs of torque is an absolute blast! I'm coming from an Ford F350 and F150; and the other vehicle in my garage is a 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser HE. Certainly the Land Cruiser's fit-n-finish, ride quality and extremely powerfully V8 are great but, the off-road prowess and quality build of this hybrid Jeep is second to none. And yes $68K is expensive but, the heritage (1941), over-built reputation and ability to tackle anything in New Mexico and/or Colorado is an incredible confidence boost. Not to mention there are Jeep dealers/service almost anywhere in The US is very comforting. Hybrids make good sense when you think of the storm that just hit my home state of Florida where there was no electricity available for an extended time. Finally it's a Jeep and that's pretty cool.",5,10/10/2022,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"I’ve had mostly BMWs and Audis over the years and cycled through a few TJs and a YJ as a weekend car. I’ve been driving my 4Xe as a daily for 6 weeks now and love it. It’s quiet, comfortable and generally fun to drive. Not a rocket but definitely quick enough to merge. It is loud on the highway and something to consider if you travel long distances. For me and my short commute, it’s perfect. I got 900 miles on my first tank of gas and average 32 MPG in hybrid. With everything going on in the world, it just makes me smile. Is it for everyone? No. Update, 7 months and 3,600 trouble free miles. I also took it offroading and loved the regen braking, quiet ride and torque.

My wife was recently left stranded on the side of the road because spare tires and jacks are no longer provided. I was told that a tire inflator is provided instead. What good is a tire inflator if the tire is punctured? They also told me that this is to reduce weight and improve fuel economy! Who was in the meeting that approved this [non-permissible content removed]? Where is the common sense in this? I’ll give up a fraction of a mpg not to have my family stranded.

"Update: After 30,000 miles, I haven't had any issues with the Cherokee besides the sluggish downshifting that is well-known on the 9-speed. Putting it into Sport mode eliminates the issue, but sometimes you need speed quickly, and the delay can be frustrating. Other than that, there has been few complaints, and I still love how it handles on and off road. I needed an SUV with some real off-road ability while maintaining on-road drivability, and this has come through in spades. It drives beautifully, and its off-roading ability is supurb. Just a first class combination. I am not one of those people that buy a 4x4 because I ""might"" need it. I do need it because I hike, snowshoe, go to the dunes, do off-roading, etc. I have already done very technical off-road trails, went through deep snow and mud, and driven on dunes, and it has handled them all beautifully, and I have had all the power and torque that I needed on road and off. There are a lot of smart details that I love about this. As an example: when driving on the sand, you need to lower the psi in your tires. Well, when you are back on the road, you need to air up your tires again. When airing up, the Trailhawk will actually honk the horn when your psi is correct. When I was in the snow, it automatically turned on the heated seats and steering wheel. Those are just a few of the details that have set the bar to a new limit. A few cons are the gas milage and purported reliability, but I will have to see about maintenance issues down the road. My second choice for a vehicle was going to be the Subaru Forester, but I can guarantee you I have already been in situations where the Forester would have been stuck in the mud, both figuratively and literally....",5,07/06/2022,2023 Jeep Cherokee

"A bolt was installed on a harness causing all the wiring to fry and blow fuses. The vehicle has been at the Chrysler Jeep dealership service department in Culpeper, VA since June 1st and is still not repaired after 4 months.

"I just recently traded in my 2012 Jeep Liberty, as a military wife of an active duty service member that Jeep has followed me all over America and Europe. I did a lot of research before I purchased my new 2022 Jeep Wrangler 4xe, I pretty much engulfed myself with all things Jeep for over a week. Well, my new purchase did not let me down. I still had the same comfort I did with my Liberty, but with all the technology perks. I basically have a computer assistant while driving, the ride was really smooth and quite, most of the time I couldn’t tell it was on. I drove 23 miles on a full charge and didn't need the gas to take over. It was raining really hard on the highway, and it wasn’t that loud like the older Wranglers used to be. The battery comes with a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty, that’s long enough to keep my mind at ease. I purchased the extra 85,000 mile warranty from the manufacturer, and was told that if we get stationed overseas it will be honored at any Jeep dealership. This was a huge plus for me and my family. Over all, yes read the reviews but I am really happy with my purchase. I’ll be able to charge my Wrangler overnight, and make my commute to work completely on battery power, and I still feel safe enough that if I run out of battery charge my gas will kick in smoothly without me doing anything. Because that’s exactly what happened, when I did run out of battery and the engine kicked in on the highway I could hardly feel the change. This Jeep will not only save me money on gas, but it’s going to be fun for my family. I strongly recommend it, and I look forward to the day that the price will go down so everyone can be able to see how great this Jeep really is.",4,09/04/2022,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
Have 7000 mile on it now and no problems at all. I bought it because it fit in my old model T garage built in 1920 along with the house. Do not like leaving my cars outside so this fit perfect.,5,07/04/2022,2023 Jeep Renegade
"2 months after I bought it, the charging module died. When the part finally comes in it will have been 5-6 months of not being able to charge it. It likes to do a fuel and refresh mode which is extremely loud. It is supposed to be because when it's not using the motor it needs to get the oil and gas moving around. My jeep won't let me charge it but it still makes extremely loud refresh mode noise. Chrysler should not build vehicles they can't fix right away. What a joke. There is also less room in it because of the battery. I couldn't use the employee discount and I couldn't get a tax rebate for getting a hybrid. You only get that if you buy a Pacifica. I should have just kept my 2017 Jeep Wrangler.",1,07/04/2022,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe
"I was forced to buy a new car because of an engine failure so I was not excited about getting this car. It was on the lot and in my price range. Overall it is not a bad car. I used to drive a GMC Acadia and this is ALOT smaller so that is a big change for me. The car has some nice features, fuel economy is pretty good. I am averaging about 26-27mpg with suburban driving. The 4 cylinder engine is a little sluggish (not terrible for average driving) and the transmission has some strange shift points under load and from stopped. My car doesn't idle that smoothly for a 4 cylinder. I have a 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L that idles smoother with the V6. If you can afford it the Grand Cherokee L is a great car. I'm 5'11"" 190lbs and if you are bigger than that I would look for something else. I feel a little cramped when driving. Maybe I would like it more if I wasn't forced into buying a new car during the absolute worst time to buy a new car. Would I buy it again? No, but just because I would want something else not because it's a bad car.",3,03/04/2022,2024 Jeep Compass

The uConnect system is outstanding, wireless Apple CarPlay with multiple users is awesome, along with the audio sounding excellent. Plenty of space, plenty comfortable. So many professional reviews complain about the power train, but let me tell you , it is more than ample, I have no complaints whatsoever, it's got plenty of ""go"". Keep in mind, this is an SUV, not a Challenger. My previous experience with another brands direct injection engines was horrible. Avoid those engines at all costs !!

"If you're buying this to flat tow behind an RV, BEWARE. This is the worst possible transmission for disengagement. It's all electronically controlled and there are literally 20 numbered steps required to complete this process and 15 to reverse the process. While towing the vehicle there is no way to lock into this mode or to know if the car might have slipped back into engagement. The result is burning up your transmission at a cost of $15,000 for the dealer to fix it. Yes, this is the voice of experience. The service manager looks at his computer, which tells him that the transmission was not disengaged therefore it's your fault. I can't imagine a more ridiculous design and the dealership is not going to tell you about it because most of the sales people don't have a clue how this transmission works. By the way, if you opted for the extended warranty, don't count on it. That funny little man that said, ""If anything happens you come see me."" didn't mean a word of it.",2,05/03/2022,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"There are several big issues. First, it's not a hybrid. You either use all your battery or all your gas. Second, it's not for road trips. Only 18mpg over 60mph. It's lugging around 800 lbs of electric weight if it's in gas mode. Third, when the gas engine doesn't run much, the extra gas isn't burned off and ends up in the oil pan, increasing the oil level. Read up on it in the groups, it happened to mine as well. Fourth, if you live in the cold weather, just be prepared to go out some days to a completely empty battery. Don't know what drains it, but happened to me on more than one occasion. But, I still give it 2 stars for the smoothness, refined materials and feel. Driving it was super smooth, only wish the battery would last more than 20 miles. 240v charge time is 2.5 hrs. 110v charge time is over 14 hrs. It was built for mall crawling or beach rides. If you even think about going on a trip, just make sure you know its only going to be 18mpg in ""hybrid"" mode. ",2,11/02/2022,2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe

Engine isn't ""that"" bad. Wireless Android Auto. Wireless Carplay. Great safety features. Auto high Beams, Adaptive Cruise Control. Cons: No Homelink, Back window visibility, while the engine isn't ""that"" bad, it definitely isn't ""that"" good either. Needs a tune on the transmission... although Pedal Commander fixes that right up.

It has plenty of options to upgrade and the best part of this vehicle is the engine; 2.0L I4 DOHC Turbo Engine with Start Stop - this feature can be manually shut off if you don't care for it. Unless you're going to be hauling a very heavy load or doing serious off-roading, you should buy the 6 cylinder engine. The engine's HP/Torque ratio compared to the 6 cylinders are very close. I purchased this Jeep without any running boards b/c I can save a few bucks by purchasing an after-market kit. It comes with a Jeep toolkit, extra wheel locks, and a rear backup camera cover in order to protect it while you're driving off-road in gravel from any debris that may damage the lens.

"I decided to buy a 2021 Latitude Lux as I needed their Active Drive II in order to flat tow the vehicle behind my RV. Active Drive II is a Jeep 'secret' that you only (hopefully) learn about after telling a dealer's representative that you intend to buy a Jeep primarily so you can flat tow it behind your RV. This is one of the very few Cherokees that can be flat towed! Does Jeep know how many hundreds of thousands RV owners are looking for flat towable vehicles and how few there are? Also, why Jeep forces potential Cherokee buyers who need this feature to buy the Lux (Or the Trail Hawk) rather than make it available on all models, especially a more expensive one, is beyond me. That said, our LUX is loaded with other features that make driving it a pleasure! It's quick, steers easy, and handles great! We love our new Latitude Lux and look forward to driving it on a warm sunny day with the sun roof open!",5,04/08/2021,2023 Jeep Cherokee
"We chose the 2020 Jeep Renegade Latitude 4x4 due to features and lease price around 300 a month. Jeep has reduced the price quite a bit on the 2020 year. It has a lot of Latitude features like the bigger Cherokee. Have not driven it much yet, but so far we like it more, compared to my old Patriot. Update; I have driven it the past week and it has no problems with acceleration or transmission. It is great for either highway or city driving. It is every bit a small SUV, and this the sixth jeep we have had in our garage. Kim has the 2016 Jeep Cherokee which is far better than the Mazda CX5 she had. Overall, I give any negative reviews on this Jeep a thumbs down for bias. This jeep is fun to drive and it performs well in traffic. We don't have any passengers besides the two of us, so we don't use the back seats much. Maybe in three years we will get the model with a tow package and make a trip. I like the added altitude package in this jeep. One thing I don't like is there is no full sized spare in many current vehicles, unless you order it or get a tow package. The tire repair kit is OK, but not for long trips where you may need a real spare. I will be getting a full spare tire and wheel soon. MPG may get better after more highway driving.

"I bought this car a little over a month ago and I love it so far. It has better mileage than my last SUV and has much better and updated tech. The A/C is great and I have no problem with the handling or the speed, but it does take some getting used to. The best part is the exterior styling, the off road and 4x4 capability, Apple Car Play, and cool little Jeep easter eggs all over the place. I have 0 complaints with the quality of the interior and there’s plenty of head and leg room up front. The cloth seats are comfortable and UConnect Infotainment system is very easy to use. Price wise I got a really good deal on it and the only cons I have are the cargo room, the confused 9 speed automatic transmission and that the Infotainment screen goes blank in extreme heat but once the interior is cooled and the screen is rebooted, then all is well. That may need to be dealt with at the Dealership soon but otherwise I love my Renegade and am really looking forward to taking it off roading and am confident come winter that my Renegade Trailhawk will get me to where I need to go.",5,02/08/2021,2023 Jeep Renegade
"This is a fun vehicle. It’s great to drive in town or on the highway. There are plenty of things to buy that personalize the Jeep. And I keep the top and doors off much of the summer. But don’t expect any support from the dealer after you buy your Jeep. In this calendar year I went or called two dealers. One for routine service….which never happened. After two hours I went into the garage and drove it out myself. I couldn’t find the service manger anywhere. Not long after that I got back to the airport from a trip and the battery was dead. No doubt my fault, though I’m not sure what I didn’t do. Probably didn’t turn off the car. So I called AAA, who came right out. While I was waiting, though, I called the nearest dealer and asked about towing (just in case). Three days!! I might buy another Jeep. I’ve had others.

"Had to have a rental and unfortunately was given this vehicle to drive. I’ve had many different types of cars/trucks including 3 Jeep’s in my life. This one is such a pain. First off I hate the start stop push button feature which most new cars have nowadays, but the engine cuts to low gear when stopped at a light which affects the ac. Super annoying!!! The front window is pointless. You can’t see squat out of it if you plan on driving when it’s dark. The condensation is horrible snd can’t be remedied unless you’re using the windshield wipers constantly. It doesn’t matter if the ac is on or heat is blowing, or if the front windshield defrost is on or off. Be prepared to run your wipers and constantly hit the wiper fluid to keep the windshield clear e ought to drive. And it’s obviously a design flaw because the right side is even worse than the left! What kind of class are they using?! Huge oversight on this!! Seeing out the windshield….kind of mportant!!",2,10/05/2021,2023 Jeep Cherokee

"I've wanted a jeep for *years* but it was never the right time til this year, and boy is it worth the wait! I drove a friend's jeep back around 2011 so I came in with those expectations - but i was completely wrong. The handling is so much better, not so wishy washy, so smooth and precise. Sturdy wheel, sturdy materials, and well laid out. This thing is literally fun to drive even in the city where I'm at. I had a 2016 mazda 6 before and liked it but I love this car and its features. Finding a 2 door was tough but there was one in the metroplex that just happened to be an 80th anniversary edition they just got in and i'm so glad i took the extra price plunge. The sound system and subwoofer in the back is awesome! The upgraded touchscreen is on point and the navigation system is surprisingly quick with directions and rerouting. Pairs with my phone every time with no issues. It's everything I wanted it to be and more! We took out the backseat in less than 5 minutes and just use the space take our pups to the dog park. I love that you can just customize it however you like; take off the freedom tops, off with the doors, off with the hardtop. Jeep life really is a lifestyle and you buy into that when you get one. If you're on the fence about getting one or waiting for the perfect time, just do it. There's hardly a perfect time for anything in life, you'll just be stuck waiting thinking 'one day' like I was!",5,12/03/2021,2022 Jeep Wrangler
"Time for a new lease as my Tiguan  went back. I looked at a  new Tiguan, Subaru Outback,  Jeep Cherokee and the Volvo X 40. I chose  the Jeep Cherokee. 
The Jeep felt the most substantial by far. I was surprised by the cheap plastic center in the Subaru and the Volvo. The Tiguan was all plastic but for 289.00 a month all in (including all taxes and fees) the Tiguan Se was the least expensive vehicle I have ever leased. The same equipped Tiguan was 370.00 a month. I really missed the heated steering wheel from my previous BMW so it was a must for my new lease. A Tiguan with a heated steering wheel was 407.00 a month. I set out for a new compact SUV for 350.00 a month. I never thought of leasing a Jeep but in my budget it kept coming up so I test drove it. I knew instantly this would be my next vehicle. I leased a Jeep Cherokee V6 Limited with Elite Pkg. for 381.00 a month including taxes and all fees.  This was the most equipped car I ever had. Cooled seats front and back it even can parallel park. I love the remote start which automatically  turns on the heated seats and steering wheel. This Jeep is on par with my X3. Which was 500.00 a month a new one 700. a month to lease. Value wise this is the best vehicle you will find. It took months of tracking prices and negotiating for me to get this price. 
  The Jeep ride is great, acceleration is great too. The Volvo was slightly better but the Jeep was pretty close. It rides more like the X3. The info entertainment is easy to use intuitive and fast which really makes for a great driving experience. The Jeep is compact unlike the Tiguan which felt like you had so much space in the cabin. Handling is sharp seats are comfortable. Since it mainly me and one other person most of the time I can live with the snug cabin. I took Delivery at the end of November and have had no problems. Fit and finish is great  so I am thinking it should be pretty reliable.
Update: I still love my Cherokee. The Adaptive cruise control is amazing. Life changing feature. The stop and go really takes the sting out of heavy traffic. The automatic high beams are amazing.  The ride is great it really takes any size pot hole no problem. Well not quite the razor sharp handle of a BMW it’s much more comfortable. The ride, handling, and acceleration strike a great balance. The lane keep assist is the cars big down fall. It’s will pull slightly at the wheel for no reason. Less on the highway than around town. It feels like you hit a piece of ice. I doesn’t bother me as much  now but at first it was annoying as hell. I tried to disable it but couldn’t. I just put it on the lowest setting. Hopefully they will use a lane centering on the next update. The car feels so high tech it’s  quite unexpected.. I am so glad I got this Jeep. I would have never considered it, if not for the chip shortage. Inventories were starting to get tight and they had the inventory. I got this lease at such a great deal.I am so grateful as prices are skyrocketing on leases.  Blown away by the luxury driving experience from a Jeep, Who knew!",5,12/02/2021,2023 Jeep Cherokee

I've owned my 2020 Renegade Latitude for almost a year and now trading it in at a loss I hate it so much. I've owned lots of Jeeps before and loved them but this one rides like an 18 wheel truck. The gas mileage is 23 combined but the 12-gallon gas tank is horrible. Gasing up 3 times a week,1,10/02/2021,2023 Jeep Renegade
Super happy with my purchase ,5,06/01/2021,2023 Jeep Cherokee
Just the right size. the only complaint is the seats that pick up every piece of lint in the air. Hard to keep clean. I had them install leather seats and its much better. Its a shame they don't give you the option,5,06/11/2020,2023 Jeep Renegade
This subcompact SUV is roomy enough for my family. It has the head room we need. The back seats are roomy also with plenty of head room. The cargo area has plenty of room for groceries for my family too.,5,09/10/2020,2023 Jeep Renegade
Gorgeous vehicle loaded with details comparable to Grand Cherokee. The 6 cylinder is responsive with quick acceleration and tight turning radius. Very quiet interior with minimal road noise. Smooth ride. Love this Jeep Cherokee!!!,5,12/09/2020,2023 Jeep Cherokee
