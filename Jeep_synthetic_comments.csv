"Decent SUV, nice features, Jeep is usually always overpriced but resell doesn't usually lower either. Maintenance is usually always needed. Check engine lights usually always on.

I also have a few different styles of tires and a few different sizes and colors. I am also happy with the way the Jeep is driven. I've never had a problem with the car driving on a bumpy road, or when I was riding in a car.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Kitten from I love my TJX I'm a Jeep fanatic. I've owned a few Jeep Wrangler's and I'm always looking for a nice, quiet, and well-built car. This is my first time owning a Jeep Wrangler. I don't like the look of the car, and feel that the Jeep is too small. It's also not a great car. I'm not a big fan of the looks of the interior, and I'm not a huge fan of the way the car looks and feels. I also don't like the looks of the inside of the car. The interior is a little too big and it looks like a Jeep, but it's",1

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great! I bought this for my wife. It is a great car for her to drive. She likes the interior of the car to be more minimalist and has a lot of fun driving it. She also likes that she can use the trunk to get to the car and not have to get out of the car. The windshield is a great feature for her and she can use it to get to the car quickly. She would also recommend this car for anyone who wants to take her to the park.

Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Poor quality. Needs to get tires replaced. My wife and I bought this car and it is just not ready for over a year and it has to be replaced. If you are looking for a car that can easily be changed and keep it fresh for 20+ years, this is it. We are buying a car so we can get another one.

I'm a big fan of the Jeep Renegade, because the styling is very nice and the styling is pretty good. It's got a big, hard, big bump and a big, hard bump on the rear end. I think this is a good value for money. The Renegade is a good Jeep, but it's not going to be for everyone.

I'm a big fan of the Jeep Grand Cherokee. It's got a 6.4L V8 with 6 cylinders, a 3.8L V8 with 4 cylinders, a 6.1L V8 with 6 cylinders, and a 5.1L V8 with 8 cylinders. It's also got a 6.1L V8 with 6 cylinders, a 6.1L V8 with 8 cylinders, and a 5.1L V8 with 8 cylinders. I've even seen a Jeep Cherokee with a 4-speed manual transmission.

I can't think of a better way to drive a Grand Cherokee than to drive it in a single-seater. It's not a good idea to drive a Grand Cherokee on a single-seater, so I'd do that.

Sudden Unintended Acceleration (SUA) or Sudden Acceleration Incidents (SAI) involving Jeep Cherokees/Grand Cherokees was reported by Diane ** in a March 1997 ABC News Primetime segment and the ""phenomenon"" still exists today!

Sudden Unintended Acceleration (SUA) or Sudden Acceleration Incidents (SAI) involving Jeep Cherokees/Grand Cherokees was reported by Diane ** in a March 1997 ABC News Primetime segment and the ""phenomenon"" still exists today! It is a driver's accident that occurs when the Jeep is traveling at a slightly higher speed than the normal speed of traffic. It is not something that is a coincidence, but it is something that happens. It is a very serious accident and it could be fatal. It is a little more common than you might think. In this case, the Jeep was traveling at a slightly slower speed than normal traffic. It is a result of the Jeep's braking system. This system is designed to make the Jeep accelerate at a faster rate. The driver of the Jeep has to stop the Jeep, pull out of the way, and the Jeep is in motion. The Jeep speed is usually faster than normal traffic. It is not a coincidence. If a Jeep is traveling at a slower speed than normal traffic, the driver of the Jeep is probably going to be in a more dangerous position. They are going to be in an extremely dangerous position.

Sudden Unintended Acceleration (SUA) or Sudden Acceleration Incidents (SAI) involving Jeep Cherokees/Grand Cherokees was reported by Diane ** in a March 1997 ABC News Primetime segment and the ""phenomenon"" still exists today! The problem is that it's not even a problem with one car or one person. It's a problem with multiple cars. If a Jeep owner wants to get involved in a car accident, he or she can do so at any time. But if a Jeep owner wants to get involved in a vehicle accident, he or she must get the proper insurance.

What's going on here is that the number of cars in the parking lot of a Jeep Cherokee or Grand Cherokee is increasing. So, if a Jeep owner is driving a Jeep Cherokee or Grand Cherokee, he or she has to get insurance.

A Jeep Cherokee or Grand Cherokee has a $250,000 annual deductible. If a Jeep owner earns more than that, he or she must get a $25,000 deductible. If a Jeep owner earns less than that, he or she must pay $100,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.

"Jeep has always been a reliable brand and I love my Renegade. The interior is super roomy and very comfortable. This model also includes a fair amount of cargo space. The only features missing from this particular model are no hatchback and its lack of a cargo hitch. It'd be quite useful to be able to haul a small trailer if need be, as we have motorcycles that sometimes need hauled. But other than that, the safety features are great. As a parent, it makes me much more confident knowing my daughter is the safest she can be. The Jeep Renegade drives very smooth and it's a comfort to know that when the weather turns snowy, that 4-wheel drive can save you.

The exterior is a little more on the comfy side. The rear seats have a little less padding than I anticipated, but the seat covers do a good job of covering the rear window and the side windows are very comfortable. The cabin is very spacious, and there are plenty of room for all your favorite activities. The interior looks very nice, and the interior is very comfortable.

The Jeep Renegade does have a large cargo area, so I wanted to take it in a different direction. If you're looking for a smaller vehicle that is capable of handling more cargo, the Renegade is definitely one for you. It has a really nice interior, and if you're looking for a vehicle that can handle more cargo, this is the car for you.

Rated 3 out of 5 by ken from I would definitely buy this again if it had a cargo hitch, but this one is a little bigger. It is larger than a typical Jeep but I think it is only for the most extreme of rides. I am on a long ride on the highway and I'm constantly seeing this hitch. It has a little bit of a hitch and a little bit of a small hitch but overall it is very comfortable and a very nice value for the money. The only thing I would change would be that I will be looking for a Renegade in the future.

"I own a 2009 Jeep Patriot and my transmission went out. Since I bought it new and it came with a lifetime powertrain warranty, which includes the transmission, I didn't think getting it repaired would be a problem. Little did I know that in order for the warranty to remain effective, you must have the transmission inspected within the first 5 years of ownership. That little fact was never revealed to me even though I have had all required maintenance performed by the dealership. Has anyone else had this problem and what was down to resolve it short of paying for the repair - which is going to run $4,200.00 plus shipping and handling? I would like to know!

Rated 3 out of 5 by Tom from Great for the price I bought this car for my daughter's birthday. She has had a few problems with the steering wheel on her Jeep, but it's all working fine. I have had it for months and it's working great. The car has been a great addition to my collection. It is very well built and has a high level of reliability. The only downside to this car is that it is expensive. I would recommend this car to anyone who has a Jeep.

She has bought her own Jeep Patriot for about 2 years now and has not had the issue with it running out of power. She has had the engine replaced and a new one installed and the car is running great. Our only issue is the transmission is broken and the factory can't fix it. It's pretty much impossible to fix.

I know that I will have to pay for the repair. So... I have been to the dealership and they have already paid for it. What's your excuse for not paying for the repair? So I hope you are paying the reasonable price for what you paid for it. I am not asking for money to fix the problem. I am asking you to be patient.

"On February 12, 2020, I was in a major accident that should have cost me a lot more than a vehicle. I was hit in the driver's door by a dump truck at 60mph. Thankfully I was in my Jeep! The frame took the force of the blow and it slid 50 yards before it came to a stop beside an electrical pole. While my Jeep was totalled, I was lucky enough to walk away with only a few scratches and bruises. I think I have sold all my friends and family on how safe Jeeps are. My son has asked for one for his 16th birthday and I think it's a wonderful idea. Just wanted to say Thank you, had I been in our van I wouldn't have made it.

I love my Jeep and the amount of people who come to visit my shop. I couldn't have done it without you. I believe that if you have a Jeep that you can put into a car and drive to school, to work, to school, to your job and to the place you want to be, you can do it.

"The Jeep Patriot is by far one of the best vehicles we have owned. It gets great gas mileage and does awesome in snow. This past Christmas my family went to visit family in Jamestown NY and ran into blizzard like conditions and if it wasn't for the 4 wheel drive I don't know what we would have done. The Patriot had no problems getting us through the snow storm. We like the 4 wheel drive. It gets up and goes with no problems. There's plenty of room for the family and groceries. We like all the other features as well. But we find it hard to look both ways when there's a passenger or you're by yourself and it's hard to see down the road cause of the door frame. Other than that we don't have any complaints. My family loves the Patriot and was sad to hear that they are stop making them. I'm a dad and my daughter loves the Patriot. She loves the Patriot, but she is really happy to have it. The Patriot is one of the best things to have. It's a great car for a family and it does what it does. I can't say enough good things about the Patriot. I am hoping for a very happy family and I am glad I have the Patriot. I am sure it will be a great vehicle for our family.

This past Christmas my family went to visit family in Jamestown NY and ran into blizzard like conditions and if it wasn't for the 4 wheel drive I don't know what we would have done. The Patriot had no problems getting us through the snow storm. We like the 4 wheel drive. It gets up and goes with no problems. There's plenty of room for the family and groceries. We like all the other features as well. But we find it hard to look both ways when there's a passenger or you're by yourself and it's hard to see down the road cause of the door frame. Other than that we don't have any complaints. My family loves the Patriot and was sad to hear that they are stop making them. I think they might be getting a second life.

I'm a fan of the Jeep Patriot. I always heard about the Jeep Patriot when I bought it in 2012. The Patriot is a great car and we all know about it. It's the same great car that we all love. As a passenger, I would use it for all I do and I would be happy to have it with me for all I do. I don't know why we didn't have the Jeep Patriot, especially because we are a family and it just might be the only one that we have. We are so glad that the Jeep Patriot is back. I will be going back to the Jeep Patriot for a long time. Don't let them beat you up.",1
"I love my Jeep Patriot. It is extremely reliable, and in wonderful condition. Since my car is front wheel drive, it is common for my front tires to skid in the rain if going at a fast speed. I love the color of my vehicle, and the shape of it. The trunk of my car is very spacious, I am able to fit a lot of things back there. Also, the back seat of my car is spacious. I enjoy having cloth seats because it is hot where I live, and leather seats would burn me. The only complaint I have in regards to my vehicle would be concerning the middle seat in the back row. It is uncomfortable to sit in that seat because there is not much space to put your legs. Sometimes I wish the car was a little more technologically updated, but other times I love the simplicity of my car. Less technology, less problems. This is a great car, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good for the price I ordered this Jeep Patriot for my daughter and she just loves it. It is so comfortable, and it comes with a few extras. She has had it for a few days now and she really likes it. She is currently on her Jeep Patriot to run laps.

Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good car But I'm a Jeep fanatic and don't want to buy a Jeep for my kid. I have a Jeep Patriot and I have a family of 4. I bought this car for the two of us and it is good. It has a decent price. I'm not a big fan of the interior. The rear seats are very small and I can see that the back seat is not comfortable. I would highly recommend this car. I would also recommend this car to anyone who loves a good Jeep.

I'm a huge Jeep fan because it is a great car with a great look. I have 4-wheel drive, and like to keep my Jeep Patriot in my Jeep. It can get a little hot when I drive it for a bit, but that is not a problem. The only thing that I would change is the front bumper. I would recommend doing a little more trimming and just getting rid of the bumper. I would also like to see a little more interior trimming.

Rated 5 out of 5 by jcjr from Great car, but the price is a little high. I didn't expect this car to stand out on a price scale. I think so. The price is high, but the performance is an issue. The hood is a little tight, which is a good thing. The body is a little too short. In fact, it is a little too small for a road bike. I am a heavy sleeper and I am not one to spend a lot of money on a vehicle that is not good for me. I am a big fan of the Jeep Wrangler, but I think the price is a little high.

"My Jeep Patriot is good and reliable. I drive easily to work every day, over 50 miles, and get around on my rural gravel roads, which can get really wet or slick in the winter and spring, and don't always get plowed quickly. Plus they are hilly, so I need 4 wheel drive often after bad weather. The engine is good, but not very powerful. I would like to feel a bit more power when I press the gas pedal. I also got bigger tires for my jeep, as the original tires were kind of small, and I wanted more powerful looking tires. Other than that, I like that it's an SUV, a 4 wheel drive, has lots of room in hatch, leather seats and is comfortable. I really wanted a Jeep, as I had a Jeep in the past that I loved, with the classic Jeep look.

The interior is clean and nice, and it is very pleasant to drive. The front seats are nice and comfortable to sit across from. I also love the fact that the back seats are small, and that there is a long front zip lock for the front seats. It's very comfortable, and I like the way the seats are folded up. The only thing that I will change about the Jeep Patriot is that I have to give it a 2.5 star rating for its small size. It is not a good value for money.

I ordered a Jeep Wrangler with a 2.0L V6 engine, had to replace the wheels and had to remove the front and rear wheels. I had to replace the front and rear wheels of the Jeep Wrangler and install the rear wheel. It worked great. I'm not a huge fan of the paint job. I have to use a brush tool to paint the front and rear windows but it works great. I am happy with the quality and the installation.

I had a few minor issues and the car was very broken down and not very happy with the parts. The car was sitting out in the snow and I was starting to get tired of it and was looking for something else. I found this car. It's a great car that is well built and all the parts are in perfect condition. I had to do more work to get it to the dealer. It was my first time buying a car and I'm very happy with it.

I have had it for three years and it has been great. The interior is great too, it is well built and has the best steering and brakes. I love the steering.

Upon arrival, they told me that the problem was in the driver's seat, but the driver's seat was totally off. I told them that I was going to run it again and they told me that it was a good idea to put the car in the back seat. I told them that I was going to take my wife and my son and bring them to a local tow truck. They said that was possible, but I had to pay the tow truck a $25 fee. They told me that they did not want to take my husband and my son, so I told them that I would take my wife and my son.

"I've now owned five Jeeps. Two Grand Cherokees and three Wranglers (two JK models and one JL model). While I've had a hiccup or two, Jeep has been great about making things right and the vehicles have been reliable. The reliability and versatility have kept me a loyal Jeep customer. Recently, and unfortunately, we were the victims of an F-250 Super Duty red light running hit-and-run driver that hit us and ran totaling the vehicle with only 4980 miles. Me, my wife, daughter, and son, all walked away the kids with zero injuries and my wife and I with minimal airbag related injuries. To say I am thankful is an understatement. I'm so bummed that I lost so much of what I invested in my Jeep and am having trouble finding a replacement, but at the end of the day, we all walked away from a collision that had we been in a smaller vehicle, there would have likely been severe injuries or even death.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good, but not great. I bought a Jeep Wrangler this summer and my wife and I have been using it for over a year now. The Jeep Wrangler is the best value on the market. It's got the best handling, front-wheel drive, and suspension. The interior is well made, the seats are comfortable and the interior is great. The only downsides are the tires. On the one hand, I prefer the Jeep Wrangler's chrome trim and the $40 price tag on the tires. The JK Wrangler is a nice vehicle, but it's not as good as the Jeep Wrangler. The JL Wrangler has more room for improvement because it's less expensive and it's available in a larger package. I've been looking for a new JL Wrangler and I'm happy to report this is the one that I've found. I have a question to ask myself when purchasing a new Jeep Wrangler",1

I love the fact that it has a full suspension, even with the seat. The front seats are great too, even when there are a lot of seats. I was able to have my Jeep sit perfectly when it was parked, and I can also drive it in my car without it getting stuck.

I had a few issues with the car and it was starting to feel a bit stiff on my hands and it started to wear down. I was going to purchase another Jeep but decided to go with the Jeep because I am a huge Jeep fan. The Jeep was great. The only problem I have is that the steering wheel is a little loose. I had to replace it.

"The Wrangler is a distinctive vehicle. Love it or hate it, it’s not your typical truck or SUV. It has a fun, bouncy ride, with uncanny turn radius. It’s the go-anywhere car that gives an underlying sense of freedom. They haven’t changed that much over the years, mine is the 2018 JL model.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Matt from Nice, sturdy, and reliable Bought this on a whim to go on the road after my wife ordered a new Toyota Camry. I took the car with me on a long drive, and it was a pleasure to drive. The only thing that was a little annoying was that the steering wheel was on the outside of the car, and the steering wheel wasn‪t attached to the steering wheel. There was one side of the car that was not attached to the steering wheel. The car was too big, and it was a little hard to drive. The steering wheel is a little loose, but I would say that it is a little more comfortable than its predecessor. The only other thing that was a little frustrating was the steering wheel and the steering wheel were too tight. The only thing I would say is that it was a little heavy, but I think they may have adjusted it to make it a little more comfortable. Overall, I would say",1

Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from The Wrangler was a good choice for what I needed and what I needed. I received the Wrangler for free. I was very happy and pleased with the choice of vehicle. I am a big fan of the Wrangler. It is a great car. I was surprised by how well the Wrangler handles. The only exception I had was the front wheels. I did not see any problems with the front wheels. The Wrangler has a fair amount of torque and it has a lot of power. The front wheel is not too much of a problem. I would recommend the Wrangler.

"The leather interior and heated seats of the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Edition were my top two favorite features especially in the NY wintertime when the average temperature runs so cold that drivers are lucky to be able to get their doors open or their windows rolled down because cars in this type of cold freeze shut.

The gas tank was huge already, so required a lot of gas to fill up. I generally put in $10 to $15 maximum and gas up more often than full tank fillers. And I found myself having to put in that amount of gas on a daily basis and that was a while fresh new financial hell for me to navigate.

As for the interior of this truck, it was in the rear row of the front of the truck, and it was definitely a big part of what made this car so special. It has the most beautiful and most unique interior in the entire Jeep ever built. This truck is also the first Jeep to have a fully electric power steering, and it's also the first to have a full back seat. It's also the first Jeep that has a fully enclosed trunk. The interior is also great for the price of the truck itself. The interior is truly unique in a Jeep. A couple of things that stood out to me were the interior of this Jeep, the interior of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and the interior of the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Edition. The interior of the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Edition is made from a hardwood flooring with a very long, high-grade finish. Its interior is made from a soft wood and is made from a wood flooring.

Rated 5 out of 5 by jennifer from Good deal I bought this truck to drive to work. It is the best truck available. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a great truck, but I have to say that the interior is a bit rough. The interior is very comfortable and feels very heavy. The seats are very nice, but the body is very thin and the bottom is not as soft as you might expect. The gas tank is large and has been sitting on my car for years. I was able to get it to run for about a week and it was very easy to get it up and running. It is a very fun truck and will be a great part of your vacation.

A few weeks after I bought this car, I got a call from a guy who was looking for a replacement that would be a ""Superior"" version of the original Jeep. I got a call and asked him how much his new Jeep would cost and he said $20,000. So I got this Jeep and told him that he could buy the ""Superior"" version of the Jeep for $30,000 and his $30,000 would be the same as mine. He actually said that he'd pay for my replacement at $30,000, but he would give me $20,000. I was kind of pissed off at that for a few months. So I said ""Well, you know what? I'll give you $20,000 then. I'll pay you $20,000 for the replacement part. And I'll give you a full refund. So then I'll pay you $20,000. And I'll take care of the rest for you.""",1
"I love it. It drives super good and comfy. Gets good gas mileage as well. It’s by far the best vehicle we have had in a long while. I like having the usb ports and blue tooth sxm radio and the ability to insert sim cards is nice. Heated seats and steering wheel is great. Having power windows and seats are good as well. The only issue I have is the backseat space being so small and when you add three kids in three car seats it’s hard for them to buckle. They don’t have much space for leg room or to buckle if everyone is in there. It’s just super tight back there. But, it's a wonderful updated vehicle.

Sometimes the central console wont start, sometimes the traction control won't be accurate. I have tried changing the front of the vehicle to make it more responsive, but it's just a pain. I also have to replace the dashboard. It's just a little bit too wide. The steering wheel is a bit too tall and I'm a bit clumsy. I want a steering wheel with a bit more weight to help me drive better and the steering wheel is too tall. I'm not sure how the steering wheel is designed to be able to handle the weight of the vehicle. The steering wheel is a little bit too wide. The wheels are a bit too long.

"This is my third Jeep Grand Cherokee in the last 21 years. I bought a new 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee - Limited and now have 79,000 miles on it (02/20). The size fits the nitch of not being small, and yet not bulky like the larger SUVs. It has had a couple of small recalls and three extended warranty (72-77K) items repaired ($5,500), at my $100 deductible each (Front end/valve cover gasket/radiator). It rides nice, though a bit rocky on sharp really bumpy turns; stiffer suspension than a car. Low road noise. Handles the road well in all driving conditions. Front and rear seats are comfortable, but not plush. Great sound and NAV systems. 
      I keep cars for around 8-10 years, 100-120K miles; that is why I always buy the extended warranty, always pays for itself in the long run. Spacious back cargo area and easy drop down rear spit seats. A great perky V6, which handles nice, but not luxury; whether you are single or a family of 2-4, this a great vehicle to drive with confidence.

Rated 5 out of 5 by JL from Good for the price I bought this Jeep Grand Cherokee because it was the only one in the Jeep Grand Cherokee family. The car was very well constructed and has been very reliable. I am very picky about how many people drive in my Jeep.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from My Jeep is a great value for money. I have been wanting to buy this Jeep since I was a kid. It's not a bad car and I'm sure it will get a lot of use. I've owned a couple, one for my wife and one for our dog and she's always been a great companion. I was looking for a vehicle that could drive on its own, and this was the vehicle. My wife is a super car person and loves to drive. She's a big fan of my Jeep and I would have loved a Jeep that could be driven on its own. I'm still looking for a Jeep for my husband, and we just got the Jeep from the dealership. I'm a bit of a collector, but I'm happy with the price.

"My 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee has started stalling on me for a few months now and it is scary as well as frustrating. I have spent about 2k in repairs and it still is stalling. Is this a problem with Jeeps and is there a solution?

I do not own the Jeep Grand Cherokee but I have a few things I am looking forward to. First, I am going to take a look at the Jeep Grand Cherokee's performance and performance over the past year or so. It is really good. I am also looking forward to the fact that it is a better looking Jeep Grand Cherokee than the Jeep Grand Cherokee is. I am also looking forward to a chance to buy a new Jeep Grand Cherokee from my local Jeep dealer.

Is this a problem with Jeeps and is there a solution? I've been thinking about this for a while and I've read somewhere that it's possible to drive the Jeep in the ""wheel-drive"" mode. Could this be due to an issue with the Jeep's exhaust system? Is this a problem with the engine? The Jeep's exhaust system is not very quiet and it's not as loud as other Jeep's! Is this a problem with the vehicle's body or the exhaust system itself? It's difficult to get the Jeep to turn on and off without getting stuck in the airlock. Could this be a problem with the Jeep's engine? It's hard to get a good picture of where the Jeep's engine is when the Jeep is on the road and you can't get a good picture of what the Jeep's engine is like.

A question for the future is what is going to happen to the Jeep Wrangler. I have been driving my Jeep for about 2 years now and it is a pleasure to drive. The Wrangler is still in this mode but the car is getting better every day and I think it is time to go back and try to get this car back to its former glory. It is just not right.

Is this a problem with Jeeps and is there a solution? Yes and no. I have had my Jeep for over a year now, and the Jeep is a lot better than I expected it to be.

The second most important thing I learned is how to drive. I think I learned it from my parents. They drove my dad around all the time. I used to do it on a Jeep with the engine running at 150 miles an hour. My dad is the best driver in the world. I just like to drive. He's got a great sense of humor. He knows what he's doing.

The third most important thing is how to drive. I used to drive the car at 100 miles an hour. I have a nice feeling that I'm getting a good performance. When I'm driving, I get like 50 to 60 miles an hour. My dad likes to drive at 100 miles an hour. He's got a good sense of humor. He knows what he's doing.

Then, I backed into a 6 ft. stockade fence, knocking 3 sections down, then into my neighbor’s parked car when the jeep finally came to a stop.  I was driving my Jeep back to my house and my Jeep was smashed in the bushes.  My husband’s car was also smashed in the bushes.       I was getting ready to go to work.     

I can't believe it!       I have never had to deal with such a big, slow, and hard-hitting Jeep... And I'm not exaggerating.        I never had to deal with such a big, slow, and hard-hitting Jeep... And I'm not exaggerating.

"I purchased a Jeep Grand Cherokee because it is a 4 X 4. It also has a lot of trunk room so it has a lot of room to haul things. I can go camping and 4 wheel driving. I also like that the jeep is higher up than other vehicles. It makes it easier when you are driving over bumps. The cost of the jeep was also a good price. However, I dislike that the maintenance on this vehicle is expensive. I wish it didn’t cost so much to replace the tires. I also wish it got better gas mileage.

Rated 5 out of 5 by BJJ from Awesome car! Bought this car for my 4WD. It has great things to do in the winter. I love the fact that the front seats are bigger than in most other vehicles. The front seats are not too wide but they are much larger in the winter. The front seats are good. I would recommend this vehicle.

Rated 5 out of 5 by linden from Better than expected! I purchased this vehicle for my daughter's birthday and it is a great value. She loves her Jeep and the maintenance is perfect. She also ordered a Jeep Wrangler to replace the tires on this vehicle. I have been in the Jeep business for about 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with this vehicle. The rear of the car is very well maintained as is the roof. The driver is very helpful and very responsive. The tires are well maintained and are very strong. The interior is very nice and clean. The only downside is that the tires are very heavy. I am not sure how long this car will last.

I would really like to buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I have not seen many buyers who would agree.

"My wife and I have owned Jeeps since 1996. In 2009, I purchased a 2009 Jeep Patriot for her. The vehicle is a fine one with two exceptions: 1) It is difficult to hold on the highway when there are winds of 15 mph or more; 2) The road noise created by the tires on the highway makes it almost impossible to hear the radio. These are not the only issues that Jeeps have with the road noise. 2) The tires on the vehicle have a tendency to pull. This is an issue that I've had to deal with and have had to take a break from it.

The Jeep Compass has proved to be good. I have not had any issues with the make or model of the car. The crossover style is good for my current lifestyle and needs. The seats fold in to create extra space for moving or transporting large items. It also allows me to have space and to feel safer on the road because of the size. I dislike the radio that it came with initially. However a new one could be installed easily enough with the proper tools. I also dislike the handles on the backseat doors as they are a little hard to open. I would not recommend this to anyone.

The seats fold in to create extra space for moving or transporting large items. It also allows me to have space and to feel safer on the road because of the size. I dislike the radio that it came with initially. However a new one could be installed easily enough with the proper tools. I also dislike the handles on the backseat doors as they are a little hard to open. I have tried using the new steering wheel and the steering wheel has a little bit of a grip but it is not as good as the original. The steering wheel is a little difficult to move when it is in the back seat as the steering wheels are very large. I would recommend that you get a new steering wheel and replace the steering wheel with a new one. I did not have any problems with the steering wheel when it was installed. The only thing I would change about the steering wheel is the seat cushion. I have tried to make it fit the car better but the seat cushion is weak. I'm not sure what I would do about that. The interior is nice but not as good as the car I was driving. The hood is the only thing that is not as good as the car that I was driving. Overall, I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to experience the comfort of the car.

The turbo is far too loud and the power steering is so weak it is a pain to drive. I will be replacing the power steering with a new one in the next few weeks. I would also like to have the rear seat to be much wider so that I can have more room for the driver. I would also like the side of the car to be more spacious and more comfortable for the driver. I would also like to have an air conditioning unit. I would also like more of a roof rack so that the car can be placed on a roof without having to crane it. I would also like the windows to be larger to accommodate more people.

I had to put the brakes on it and it didn't work. I got a new engine and the car was great. I never had a problem with the engine. I can't say for sure if it was a broken engine, but it was a good car.

She keeps it in her car and when she goes to do things like work or go to the park she just drives it and does it. It is easy to put it on and it will fit in her car perfectly. She did have a problem with the engine though",1
"I have owned my Jeep Liberty for 11 years and I love it. I purchased it because I previously owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo that I also loved. I wanted a newer vehicle so I didn't have to make so many repairs but I couldn't afford a new Grand Cherokee. I knew I wanted to get another Jeep, and the Liberty was affordable for me at the time. However, I wish it was a little roomier and not so compact. If there are other people riding along it seems like there isn't enough room for drinks or purses, etc. Also, the seats are not as comfortable as my Grand Cherokee was and the interior fabric on seats is very cheap. Nevertheless, the 4 wheel drive is a must for where I live. It is a sport model with AC and a CD player. I am a long time Jeep owner and I am really looking forward to the Liberty.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good Prices and Service! Bought this on a whim and have been looking for a quality Jeep Compass ever since. The price is $40,000.00, and it has done the job. It works great and provides excellent service. I am a huge Jeep fan and I will definitely buy it.

Rated 5 out of 5 by John from Jeep Compass's Customer Service was great as well. We were able to get the Jeep from a local dealership. The dealership had an excellent customer service.

I have only purchased the Compass from a Jeep dealer and I have had good luck with it. I have been looking for a way to purchase it and have never had a problem. I have the same problem with the Compass that I have with the Jeep Compass. I have had my car for 4 years and it is a lot cheaper than the Compass. I have used the Compass for four years. I have had to buy it again and it has been a pain to get it to work. I still have the Compass but it is not a pain and has been a great car. Thank you for your service and I look forward to your return.

My car is good, but I don't think I like it. I bought the Jeep with a full size 4x4 and the car was very good. I bought this car in 2003 and it was very good. I can not say that the car was a great car. I think that it would be a good idea to have a spare. I would have to do some research on how to buy a car in the future.

Great car. Good interior. I have a nice old Ford F-150 that I have been using as my car. I have a new F-150 and I have to drive it around in my van to get it out of the van. I use it to drive my van. I use it for a lot of chores. The interior is nice and the car is nice.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from Excellent vehicle. Built well and looks great. I have never had any problems with the steering or brakes in my Jeep. I have had this vehicle for almost 3 years and have never had any problems with the steering or brakes. I bought this as a replacement for the old Jeep that had the same problem. I have had it for over a year and still have no problems with the brakes. The only issue I have with this vehicle is the price. The warranty is $300.00 for the warranty, not the $300.00 plus shipping. The truck, trailer, etc would cost a little more if you would have to pay for that extra shipping. I have not had any issues with the brakes at all.

"My 98 Jeep is an amazing car.  It has saved my life a few times.  The major issue I've had with it is that a few years ago, I had to have the transmission replaced and fixed.  Almost immediately, I blamed the shop.  Thank God for warranties.  I've had it for 5 years.  And it still runs great.  But the issue now is that the gas mileage is slowly getting worse.  I don't know if it's just crappy gas companies putting something in the gas or what.  But I live about an hour out of Austin.  And it used to use less than a quarter of a tank to get there and back.  Now, even if I don't run the AC, it uses more than a quarter.  Let me just say it's Texas summer in a black jeep with no AC, and gas prices are going up everyday.  I've only ever driven the car in the last couple of years.  I can't blame the shop.  I really don't think I'll ever be able to get my Jeep back.

"My 98 Jeep is an amazing car.  It has saved my life a few times.  The major issue I've had with it is that a few years ago, I had to have the transmission replaced and fixed.  Almost immediately, I blamed the shop.  Thank God for warranties.  I've had it for 5 years.  And it still runs great.  But the issue now is that the gas mileage is slowly getting worse.  I don't know if it's just crappy gas companies putting something in the gas or what.  But I live about an hour out of Austin.  And it used to use less than a quarter of a tank to get there and back.  Now, even if I don't run the AC, it uses more than a quarter.  Let me just say it's Texas summer in a black jeep with no AC, and gas prices are going up everyday.  I'm not sure if I'll ever get a Jeep that can be maintained on $20,000,000-plus fuel.  I am an owner of a Jeep that's been around for 30 years and I've had no problems.  I would never buy a Jeep that's going to run an AC.  My wife and I are both very happy with our vehicle.  We've had a few issues with it, but we've been told about them and we have no reason to change our mind.  I have no idea what is going on here.  I've been told that we will not buy a Jeep that doesn't run an AC.  I have no idea what the problems are with it.  I am going to keep driving it.  I have no idea what has happened.  I'm going to keep driving it.  But I'm not going to buy a Jeep that won't run an AC.  If it's going to run an AC,",1

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Value I bought this car about a year ago to get a little more mileage out of my car. I bought it from a friend as a replacement for my old Jeep. It's been about a year since I've even had a good engine and it's been pretty good. The engine in my Jeep is great and I'm happy that it's still working. I have a few other changes to make but I am happy to give it a try.

"Awesome. I love my Jeep Wrangler very much. It is fun and safe and I can also take it out and get it dirty. However, it is too bumpy and needs a console and it is not good on gas. Removing and adoring the hard top and soft tops is a chore. Also, the sound level is loud and I have to try to soundproof it to be able to hear music. But it is great to drive and easy to clean.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Tom from Great for long distance driving I have driven many miles and this is one of my favorite things to do. I have a Jeep Wrangler which is my most recent vehicle. I have to say I am glad I bought this from GM. The quality of the parts is excellent. The engine is good but the transmission is not great. The tires are good but I have a hard time getting them to stay in the car. I need a new tire and a new engine and this is the one I am looking for. The other thing that will be tough is the price. I have to say that I am not a big fan of the prices but I think they are a good price for the good driving.

We were able to get the Jeep with a few minor modifications. I got the rear bumper and a couple of tires, and the front bumper. We parked it in a cool place and it was just fine. I'm a big fan of the Jeep, I own a lot of it, and it's a great car. But I'm disappointed that the Jeep is not a good value. I'm not sure what is wrong with it, but I feel like it's a little too small for me. It's not even a good value for a Jeep, and I don't really like the ""slip"" on the front bumper. I just hope people have a good time with it.

"I really love and enjoy my Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. I live in WNY and it does great in 4000 feet of snow. I exaggerated about the snow but not about my Jeep. I like that it's smart which is a change from my last Jeep. I chose this Jeep because I'd owned two, prior to this one, and loved them. I like the appearance of my Jeep, the traction and the fact that I feel that my precious cargo, my kids are safe and secure. I just wish it had an extra seat. But great all around vehicle. I think my Jeep is the only one I have ever owned that I would purchase as a gift.


I would not hesitate to buy this Jeep again, I look forward to owning it again.

Great value for money I bought this Jeep from a friend and it is a great value for money. I have a 3 year old son. I have to say, I love this Jeep. It is very big and has lots of stability. The Jeep is very well made and has lots of fun features. The front fascia has a nice set of side mirrors. The rear fascia has a set of side mirrors that are nice on the outside. The interior has good comfort. I wish I had a little over $15,000 to spend on this vehicle, but I have no regrets. I would buy this Jeep again.

Dear Jane

I just received an email from you from my wife about a new Jeep Wrangler.  She was telling me that the Jeep was in good condition and I had to replace it because of the airbag.  I'm glad you are doing this for the Jeep Wrangler.  I'm just wondering if you are aware that there is an airbag in the Jeep Wrangler?  I have a 1996 Jeep Wrangler, and the airbag is in the middle of the bumper.  The airbag is not in the middle of the bumper.  I've had no issues with the Wrangler, and I'm sure that the Jeep will be fine.

I've heard back from you that this is a safety issue and that you are not prepared to pay for this.

"First - I never wanted a Jeep, but my husband came home one day and just like on the ads he said, ""I bought a Jeep!"" You did what??? I didn't believe my ears! Without even asking or talking about it!!! And he repeats again with a cheeky smile. Then I realise he isn't joking... I was not impressed! Eventually he got me to try it. Must admit he made a fine choice. Amazing value for money, drives very nice and great fuel economy. Highly recommended. The local dealership (Perth, WA) isn't providing first class after sales experience when it comes to it, but there is no fault I can find with this vehicle. Love the seat warmers too. :) And as a bonus, the price is right for what you pay. Just a little extra for a little extra.

Great little Jeep! My wife and I came home with this Jeep just to see what it had. We were expecting a 2.5L, but it is a nice little Jeep. We had it on a road trip to a nice town in Colorado. The only thing I didn't think of was the fact that it was not a true 4-door, but this was pretty much the best Jeep I have ever owned. We drove it home and it was only about 6 miles from our house. We got it for $40,000, but there was a lot of hassle and we didn't get it back for $50,000. I would highly recommend this Jeep to anyone who wants a little more comfort and range.

She loves it, but I was worried about not being able to use it in her day to day activities. I decided to take it home to work once I got home from work. I had 2 of them in my car and had to take them with me. My daughter loves it and she loves the front seats. I will definitely be buying another car for her as well.

The only problem I have is the rear wheel lock. I have been using this car for a long time. The steering wheel is a little loose to the point where it can be difficult to use the steering wheel. I don't think it's a problem for the driver, but if you're using it for driving, you can't really use it for anything other than driving.

My husband and I were driving around Perth on a Friday afternoon, and we stopped at a local dealership. They had an excellent selection of seats, and the prices are reasonable. We then got a 4 door convertible and a 3-door hybrid. The 3-door was very nice, and we had a nice time with our family. The 3 door was also very spacious, and the coupe was a nice convertible too. We both love it and we love the 3 door. The only problem was that the 2 doors were not working, so we had to buy a 1.5 door, which was not a good thing. The 3 door had a large bump on it that made it difficult to get to the front door. I thought it would help with the bump, but it was just too big. The 2 doors were not working, so we had to buy a 3 door, which was not a good thing. The 2 doors were not working, so we had to buy a",1

"I’ve owned dozens of Jeeps since 1994. My 2018 Jeep JLU Rubicon was ordered and purchased at my local dealer, Faricy Jeep, in Colorado Springs, CO. The order and purchase experience was top notch. Currently I have 10k miles on the Jeep. Only issues so far: 1. Rattling speaker that is back ordered but should be fixed soon. 2. Steering play - I’ve learned to live with it. 3. Off road pages isn’t available yet. I spent more for the 8.4 nav system to get the off road pages program. I’ve been told it will eventually be available. It is frustrating it isn’t available now. Otherwise I love the Jeep. It is great using it to explore Colorado. It’s expensive at $50k but worth it.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Jeep! I recently purchased a Jeep JLU Rubicon from Faricy Jeep, and I have been looking for a Jeep JLU Rubicon for a while. It is perfect for my needs and I am very impressed with the quality of the Jeep. I bought the JLU Rubicon because it is very well made and was the only Jeep I had to take on the road. I have four of them and am very happy with how well it performs. I also have a Ford 4-door Jeep that I purchased, and I have been using it as I have been getting a lot of mileage out of it. I will be purchasing more JLU Rubicons for my Jeep.

Rated 5 out of 5 by kw from Good Jeep I purchased this Jeep from an online seller. I bought it for my son to use as his day care. He uses it to cover his car at night. He is not a fan of the Jeep. He bought it for the first time in 2016. He has a very small Jeep and it is so small. He lives with his mother and works for a company that provides day care. I have used the Jeep several times and I have never had a problem. I had to get a new Jeep, because it was too small. I have been very happy with my purchase. I am sure I will be able to use it with my children. It is a great Jeep.

Rated 5 out of 5 by jj_gabriel from Best Jeep I own I have owned a Jeep for years and I have purchased many different jeeps. I have always liked the Jeep, but I have never had the opportunity to use it in a real life setting. I have been using it for the past year and am loving the Jeep. I have never had the opportunity to purchase a Jeep that is not very similar to my Jeep JLU. I have only ever used it on a few occasions and I have never had a problem. I feel like the Jeep made the Jeep much better. I have had a few times where I did not see the Jeep or thought it was a very good Jeep. I have also had a few occasions that I felt like the Jeep was a little too similar to my JLU. It is just my opinion. I have never owned a Jeep that is very similar to my Jeep JLU.

"I currently own two Jeep vehicles. One I purchased new is a 2013 Grand Cherokee. It has been the most dependable, reliable, stylish vehicle that I’ve owned. Jeep has stood behind any issues I’ve had, which have been few. My second Jeep is a 2018 Wrangler Sport that I purchased used with 8,000 miles and under warranty. It’s also a great vehicle, easy to tow behind my motorhome, and fun to drive on adventures. I’ve had no issues at all with it. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy but it’s not so heavy that it can’t be taken off the road. I think I just need to get the Jeep fixed. If you have any other questions, please feel free to comment. I’ve been looking forward to this vehicle for over 5 years with no problem.

"I have 2 Jeeps. One is a 2012 Jeep Patriot that has minor issues that haven't cost a ton. The other is a 2017 Jeep Compass that has had major financial issues recently. I have an extended warranty on the 2017 Jeep as I bought it used. I took it to my local Jeep dealership when it started hesitating and engine lights went on. They claimed it was a spark plug, maintenance issue that cost me over 500 dollars. 
      Then less than 2 months later same issues same lights on. I took it back to dealership and they diagnosed it with a throttle body problem that was going to cost me an additional 700 dollars (not under warranty). I towed it away but had to pay the 130 for the diagnostic problem they should have seen/fixed the first time. My 2012 Jeep has a 4wd light on ever since I took it to same dealership to fix a recall problem. My honest mechanic said the dealership pinched the wires when they fixed the recall problem. I will never buy another Jeep or go back to Newport Jeep for anything.

"Ok, I had an issue with my jeep stalling as I was driving. There's no noise, it ran quietly, but it just stalled. After a little while, I got it started and I went straight home gassing it to get there, then I parked it. After a couple of hours, I went back out to start it and it fired up like no problem occurred! But the next time I got in it, it started; and it was heading down the road, and it stalled on me again in the middle of an intersection endangering my life! Thank God, I had help after an hour or so; and I got it pulled into a parking lot to be towed later. We were told it was probably the fuel filter or pump going bad. So we forked out $200 to get it changed. Did that change the problem? No. It started up again. I took it down the road and it stalled out again. So with this going on, I did some digging on the internet and found others were having these issues.
      A lot were saying that the PCM module is bad. So I called Jeep to find out about a recall on the PCM module. They said I had to take it to one of their service places to get verification that this was the issue. They couldn't get it to start and said I needed to change an SKIM module ($375.00). It's more out-of-pocket. The reason the SKIM module got burned out, by what the mechanic said, was because of the power control module. So now that 1 month or so has passed and my daughter has a heart condition and my mother is 3 hours away having quadruple bypass surgery, I don't have a vehicle to get there and be with her. And I finally got a response from Jeep Daimler Chrysler that it isn't under warranty to be fixed. Even though it's their malfunctioning part that was put on the vehicle when made, they don't want to be accountable for it. So either we pay the $800.00 for the PCM module or I don't have a reliable safe-driving vehicle. How can manufacturers get away with this? The problem was with the power control module because they're not making it. The problem is the power control module is the only power control module that the Jeep Daimler Chrysler is making. So the only way we can get them to fix these issues is by getting a new power control module. That would be a huge loss for them. You would have to pay a lot more for a new power control module. So I will tell you what, this is just my gut feeling: it was a huge waste of money. I will not be buying the new power control module. I will be replacing the power control module with another one. I will be out of money. I will not be able to afford the PCM module. It's going to be a lot of trouble. I will be out of money. I will not be able to afford the PCM module. I will not be able to afford the PCM module. All in all, I think I have a lot of trust",0
"I was so excited to buy a Jeep but turns out it is the worst decision I have ever made. Between Jeep, Jeep Customer Care, and Preston's (Dealership & Service) the experience has been nothing but a frustrating headache! Bought a brand-new Jeep and it is still under warranty, all work and upkeep has been done by the jeep certified dealership, had been taking it back to the dealership for months on months telling them there is something wrong with it, motor was ticking, was bogging down, and screen going haywire. After 8-9 months of back and forth and many appointments and tests they say my motor is blown, it is burning through oil, a new vehicle with 26,000 miles on it. Jeep and the dealership have no answers just excuses. Customer Care is ridiculous, it has been over 2 months and no fix or response, and just a blame game between Jeep and the dealership and excuses. I have had no problem with the dealership's response to my complaints but I am now having to get back to them and get the car back to them.

The problem with this dealership is that they have not even offered to take it back to them, they have not even given me a replacement. They have even denied that it is a problem. The only thing that I could think of was, ""They have a customer service guy and a salesman that are supposed to help you out and get the car back to you. But they do not. And they are completely incompetent and do not know what is going on with your car."" I have been having to call them and they are still not answering my calls. I am now in the process of getting my Jeep back to the dealership, and the dealership is so lazy that they have no idea what is going on with my Jeep.

"My 2014 Jeep Cherokee was fine until July 1st 2015, with 48,000 miles on it, when it started dropping out of gear and going into neutral while driving down the road. I took it to Country Jeep in Oxford, PA where they had it in the shop for 5 days and did a ""flash"" that cost me $100. 1 week later it did the same thing again (actually 12 times in 3 hours while I was trying to get it back to the service dept). They replaced the transmission controller (after 1 week in shop). It started doing the same thing again within 24 hours after I picked it up. This is an extremely unsafe issue to have and I'm glad that I have not had an accident because of it. It's back in the shop for the 3rd time right now... how do I get this fixed once and for all??? It's a little scary because I know it's not a great solution for me. I don't want to take the Jeep out of the park and get in a wreck. I'm not a big fan of getting in a wreck and I'm not going to drive it into a river. I do have a few things that I want to do to get it back up to normal speed, but it's not going to be that easy.

"Battery died on me 4 times within 1 year. Their Premium Customer Service is not premium at all!! They are awful. They do not return calls, they can't even provide a loaner. Who will reimburse me for the time lost, not working?! Imagine having a vehicle that is so unreliable that you pray each morning that it actually starts and you can live your life.

"2014 Jeep Compass in the service department constantly for stall starting and engine ticking noise when turning it off. Chrysler states that they are unable to detect the stall starting. I have 3 videos to prove it and they're stressing me out. My Jeep has gone to the dealer over 4 times for the same issue and the only thing that was replaced was a solenoid for the ticking noise when shutting off that is still there. All I'm hearing is if it happens again. I live nearly 100 miles from the dealership one way. 
      The dealership and Chrysler representative lied like they put a black box on my Jeep to detect the issue and asked me to bring my Jeep back to the dealership by a certain date to have it removed. I get to the dealership just to find out no box was ever placed on it. I'm fed up and stressed to the max with the run-arounds and in the midst of all this from the beginning, dealing with a dying mother that passed January 25 and still mourning her, and dealing with Chrysler is too much. The problem is the dealer refused to let me return my Jeep, and after I asked for their help I was told to come back to the dealership to check on it. I am still upset about this issue. I have no idea how these people do it. I hope they've found a solution.

My Jeep is a 2013. The only issue I have with it is that it has a black box in the dashboard that was removed from the Jeep. The problem is the box was not in the dashboard, but it was in the dashboard. At this point in time I have no idea what to do with it. I do know that it is very hard for me to turn the ignition off when I am driving. I have no idea what I would do if I had a black box in the dashboard.

"I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler.  I bought it to tow behind my 40' RV.  I put my own tow bar on.  I was towing the Jeep behind my RV in heavy rain.  The trail rated jeep was engineered/designed to forge 4' rivers when the brake lights went out.  The Jeep was completely dead now.  It wouldn't start.  Chrysler towed it in about 45 minutes from me calling them, telling them that my jeep is completely dead.  That was on August 16.  It is still at the five star dealer.
      I was waiting for TIMP or fuse box that fried in the rain.  The dealer said that it is because of my after market braking system (that worked for two years, that is hooked directly to the battery on a fusible link).  That's what caused the totally integrated power module (fuse box) to fry in a rainstorm two years after installation.  This is total nonsense.  I called Chrysler case management team.  It was a waste of time.   They stated that the dealer is part of them and what they say goes.  They won't give me an auto loan.  Not that I would want another Chrysler vehicle, it's just the fact that producing a junk vehicle and not standing by them is enough for me.  It cost me 500 dollars a month to pay for a dead vehicle.  Thank you Chrysler corporation.  I will always remember to buy Toyota.

"My lumbar support periodically gives me and other drivers a ""rabbit chop"" to the left kidney while driving down the road. Periodically, when you adjust the electronic lumbar support on the driver's, it will ""pop"" and thump you in the lower back. 
      Too bad, even though this has happened to multiple drivers during the 6,000 miles I've owned the vehicle for, since the dealer can't duplicate the problem, my experience doesn't count. If this was a ""rattle"" that I was hearing, or a ""shake"" that I was feeling, I'd understand the need for an ability to duplicate the problem requirement to fix. But a kick to the back? That's not opinion, that's fact. If I kill myself in this car one day, check the seat. Chances will be good that this was the real cause of the accident! I don't think the driver's had the time to read the manual. The manual is pretty good. It's not a ""cog"" or a ""cripple"" or a ""slip,"" it's just a ""tang"" like the way the driver's ""tang"" the steering or the car's ""tang"" the dashboard. I don't know how to fix this, so I won't. I don't even know if I can. I don't know if I can make a good car, if I can make it work, if I can make it work in a way that works for me and not for anyone else. I don't know how I can do it.

I'm sure all of you have experienced this, and are wondering what it does to the driver. This is not a problem with the system. It's a problem with the driver's. I'm sure you can't be sure.

"I purchased new 2003 Jeep 4.7L Grand Cherokee. At 100k miles it began to fall apart... This is an in town no off road low annual mileage always serviced at the dealer auto. Are the auto transmission that became trashed then a blown head gasket plus numerous electrical malfunctions from wipers to windows to the master control unit that turns off all kinds of electrical components from turn signals to doors. And a major at new (6 mos in of ownership) failure on 3 separate occasions of the A/C flappers that shift airflow & temperature... Finally involving total replacement. 
      The most dangerous of which is the broken tilt steering wheel adjuster. This would seem would cause loss of steering control and potential driving casualties, especially at HWY speeds... This series of Jeep should be subject to major recalls as the items I've described are all over YouTube dealing with the failures from the late 1990s to current on this model... Jeep should recall all of this series and repair all these items free of charge! The Jeep Cherokee is a great vehicle, but this is not a car for the average Jeep owner. It's an average Jeep.

The following is an excerpt from my article on the Jeep Cherokee:

In 2009, a Jeep Cherokee was sold to a ""professional"" dealer for $1,400. The Cherokee was not purchased for the price of a Jeep. But, as a matter of fact, the buyer was a professional. The dealer in question was a former dealer and an expert on the Jeep Cherokee. The seller, who was also a professional, was a former dealer and a expert on the Jeep Cherokee. The dealer, who was also a professional, was an expert on the Jeep Cherokee.

"Since September of 2009, my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited has been having oil consumption problems. It's no leaking, not burning. It has been in/out of shop so many times I cannot count for the same problem. A star case was opened. Pistons/rings changed last summer. Still same problem occurred three more times. They are now telling me next step is new engine and they are following Chrysler guidelines. If this was in Sept. of 2009, wouldn't this be under Lemon Law? At that point, I only had the vehicle for 14 months. I have many friends who are also Jeep owners. They all tell me my Jeep runs like crap, rides like crap and there is something wrong with it! However, dealer keeps bringing me in for oil changes and fixing multiple things but yet never fixes the actual problem. My next step is phone call and letter to dealer, perhaps Chrysler. I am not going to give up. I am not going to give up on my Jeep. I am going to keep working on my Jeep. I am going to get the car repaired. I'm going to make sure I get the money to pay off my loan.

"I financed a new 2007 Jeep Commander Sport. The first of many visits to the dealer was reinstalling the software. Then, we experienced on occasion, when all the gears on the panel lit up, and our truck wouldn't drive over 20 mph, which we recorded. I took it to the dealer, and never duplicated the error (software got updated). A couple of months later, the passenger speaker had a recall, and the dealer fixed it. A few months later, we noticed on cold days the idle would drop, as it was going to shut off. Also, on stops, the idle would go up, as my foot was on the break pedal. This got me worried. Once, a pedestrian walking in front of me thought I did it to scare them. I took it to the dealer. At this time, I knew the staff at Long Beach Chrysler Jeep personally, so they tried duplicating it. Of course, it wasn't. Months went by, everything was cool, I guess, then there was another recall on the side air bags. Before I go on, I forgot my wife was in involved in an accident, as she was leaving her parking spot. To get on the street, a driver clipped her tire, and pushed her forward six feet onto a parked Lexus. No airbags were deployed. They inspected something like the black box, and said she was traveling at a certain rate of speed to deploy. Whatever, my wife was at fault. The problem ended with the self idling after the last software upgrade.
      At 30,000 miles, I needed to service the transmission. I thought about taking it to a local shop. To my surprise, my truck didn't come equipped with a transmission dipstick. The dealer, or someone with the latest tool could only check it. At this time, I had moved to Bakersfield, so my choice was to take it to the local Jeep dealer. They noticed there was a leak on a seal. My warranty covered it, but had to pay a $200 deductible. It was smooth sailing, until my turning signaler started acting up in November. It was broken, so I had to replace it, and again, I had to pay a deductible.A month later, I noticed outside air coming in through the vents, but my fan cycle was off, and air was in recirculating mode, so no air should have been noticed. I took it in, in January 2012, to see if there was a recall, or maybe something got disconnected. The Bakersfield Jeep dealer would charge a diagnostic fee, and if the part was covered in warranty, they would waive it. They found the actuator needs to be replaced, and it's not covered by my warranty. They gave me a discounted quote for $850, but got me for my diagnostic fee. I knew it was a problem with the outside air coming in, so when I took it in, I told them it must be some kind of damper, that opens and closes like a door. Why couldn't the dealer tell me that only major AC components were covered, before they took my money. So now, my warranty is expiring, and I'm shopping for an extended warranty service outside the dealer. Since I have a pre-existing problem, a new warranty will not honor it. Unless it's another component that leads to that problem.Another issue I experienced about 2 years later after purchase, was my passenger mirror needed to be replaced. The long beach dealer fixed it. Prior to that, my gear shifter got stuck, and needed to be fixed. The dealer fixed it. Within the third year or so, I was living in the valley, and it gets hot. I turned the AC on, and a real foul muggy smell would come out of the vents. I took it to the dealer, and they had report that the condensate drain was plugged up. The dealer fixed it and even cleaned up my AC vents with some fancy spray. I'm finally going to be done paying it off in a few months, and have no plans of ever buying a Chrysler/Jeep vehicle. For what it's worth, now I think I'll have to buy an extended warranty elsewhere. I hope my issues get resolved with whatever service contract I purchase, and hope it's not the actuator that the dealer said was faulty. I'm not planning to get rid of it for now, I will drive it until years of newer warranties are expired. I'm hoping to buy a Dodge and Jeep, or a Dodge Ram, or a Jeep and a Jeep, or a Jeep and a Ram. I'll try to get a new Chrysler or Jeep, or a Chrysler or a Jeep. I'll get rid of that problem.",0
"2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredo - I lost control of my Jeep traveling 57-60 mph. I nosedived into a ditch, flipped over, and rolled sideways several times down a rural hwy, coming to rest upside down in a deep ditch facing the opposite direction in which I was traveling. Each roll my head slammed into the window. I did not have the strength to save myself. After the first hard slam I was just a flop. My daughter, her friend, and my 3 year old granddaughter was in the back seat. None of my air bags deployed. It's been almost a month and I still have a headache. I can't remember my phone number, people's names, or how to get into my accounts, and I'm still picking glass out of my head. Even after the several hour glass picking at the hospital. 
      My neck and shoulder makes horrible noises, and I can barely see out of my left eye. I was wearing my seat belt, but that did nothing for my head. I just bought a new vehicle, but I panic every time I think about leaving in it. I find myself sitting in parking lots for hours trying to get through panic attacks now. I'm terrified of driving now. I don't want to do it. Thank God the little one was asleep and covered up. She rolled with it. And the older kids were banged up, sore and cut up from glass. We are still all so happy to be alive. Most disappointing thing is that I paid a lot for that Jeep at 5 Corners in Cedarburg, for its safety features and they failed me badly. I'm not sure what I would do with a car like that. I've been very lucky to have a car that can handle a lot of people in a short amount of time. I am so grateful for making this purchase. I would not have made this purchase if not for the help of a man. ",0
"I am a lifelong Jeep owner. Only ever had 2 cars that were not Jeeps. Always been a big fan, until my last two. I have had nothing but problems with my last two cars, which were purchased new. The defects have been ongoing since purchase. They have all kinds of electrical problems, all warning lights coming on for no reason at all, including the check engine light. The car will often not start or turn over at all, even though all the lights come on when I turn the key. The back gate on my last Jeep snapped for no reason at all. They fixed it 4 times and each time it would snap again immediately after being fixed. When I take the car in for service they tell me they can find nothing wrong, over and over again. I even have video, but it does me no good. They know that Jeeps keep selling, so they do nothing to help. After repeatedly taking my Jeep in for service and getting no help, I am selling it and will not buy a Jeep again. It is 2 years old. It is a nice vehicle, but I have no idea how much it will cost. I am not sure if it will be replaced or if it will be replaced by a new one. My Jeep is a new one. I have no idea how much the price will go up or down for the next 3 years. I am looking for a new Jeep to replace my old one, and I have no idea how much the warranty will be. The only thing I know is that the warranty is only for 3 years, and the warranty will be for 3 years for the next 3 years. I have never had any problems with the Jeep, but I have seen many complaints about the Jeep after it was repaired by the dealer. Do not buy a Jeep that is not repaired. If you have any questions about the Jeep, or want to contact a dealer, I am happy to answer them. I am looking for a replacement Jeep.

"I own a 2005 Jeep Liberty which I bought brand new in Dec 2005. This past weekend it broke down - luckily I wasn't driving on the freeway. I heard a clunk and a police officer was behind me and when I stopped to see what it was he said ""I heard the loud noise."" And he then told me that I wouldn't be able to continue driving and it would have to be towed. So I had to wait for a tow for over 45 minutes and the tow person told me that it was a broken rear suspension control arm and he said that there was a recall on this for 2004 and 2005 Jeep Liberties.
      So I called Woodhouse in Blair and was informed that because my vehicle wasn't put together in the right state that my Vin# wasn't on the recall list. This is a bunch of B.S. I have purchased Three Jeeps. But I will never again purchase a Chrysler product. They have lost my business forever. If the part is defective it should go for all Jeep Liberty's. Just because you don't live in the right state they won't cover it. Chrysler Corporation SUCKS!!! I Hope your corporation goes Bankrupt it will serve you right. And let's hope no one gets killed in an accident that is the cause of your company not wanting to fix something that has been recalled, but they won't fix it because the car wasn't put together in the correct State.",0
"Feb 2015 my 2014 Jeep Cherokee lost power while traveling on Thruway. Electric stays on but speedometer reads 0. Messages come about not being able to shift gears while in motion and 4wd is not available. I was not shifting, and neither attempting to go into 4wd. Had to pull over, shut down, and start up again. It happened again June 2 on Thruway. Same messages. Again had to pull over, shut down, and start up. Both times could have ended up poorly when you think about it. Happened again 2 days ago. This time while pulling into my driveway. It's at dealership now. They will probably tell me same thing as last 2 times. No ""codes"" come up on diagnostic computer and it doesn't happen when they drive it. I was driving a Jeep Cherokee. It stopped at my house and the engine was dead. I called the dealership and asked them to make a diagnostic and they did. They were very helpful. They did NOT tell me the problem. I had no idea what to do or what to do next. I called the dealership, they told me they would fix the problem. I was told I would have to call them again or face my own dealer. They told me they would do everything they could to fix the problem. The dealership said it would have to do a full diagnostic and I would have to call them again. I was told the dealership is not going to fix the problem. I called again and they said this was not happening anymore. I called back and they said the problem is still on their computer and they are still working on it. I called back and they said they are still working on the problem.

"I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty Limited which I purchased new. It has always been garage kept and never abused. At 77,000 miles, the rear differential needs to be overhauled according to North Tampa Jeep dealership. I filed a complaint and was given a case number by a lady named Jan at the Jeep Consumer Affairs Corp. I took my Jeep for a diagnosis at the aforementioned dealership, which cost me $104 out of pocket at the suggestion of Jan.
      Jan contacts me a day later and tells me Jeep will not cover the $2,300 repair because that is normal wear and tear. I asked Jan how many rear differentials go out at 77,000 miles and she could not answer me. My Jeep is not a 4-wheel drive nor have I towed anything with my Jeep. What happen to ""Jeep Tough.” It's wrong that Jeep won't cover the repairs - no, they will cover my out of pocket the diagnosis for $104.This is not my first new Jeep, but it will be my last Jeep. Jeep will not stand behind their vehicles in or out of warranty. This is very rare that the differential just happen to be out in my Jeep. Jan apparently has no supervisor above her. Her number is **. Voice your opinion on my behalf if you think Jeep was not fair with my complaint. Thank you.

I received this from my brother and he was so shocked. I got it from his brother, he's a mechanic I work for so he can make his own repairs. When he received it, he was shocked and said it was bad. He said the car had a bad differential, which I told him is what it was. He also said it was a $100,000 worth of damage. He gave me his name and I got it from him. I asked about the warranty and he told me it was for a year. Then I told him I will get it back. I asked him if he would get it back and he said no. He said he will get it back.

"I bought a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk in August 2014. This was a Certified Pre-Owned Jeep with 7,000 miles on it for $25,999. The going price $39,999. Little did I know Eastchester Chrysler in the Bronx, NY sold me a defective Jeep. My Jeep has been in the dealership repairs about 8-10 times. 4 times on a flatbed. Problem with the Jeep. My dashboard light goes off and on until the battery is completely dead. When the flatbed came to they had to give it a little charge just to move it in the position it was in. When he put the jumper cables on my Jeep I had to hurry up and get the break of in order to get it on the flatbed. First time my Jeep was taken to the dealership all they did was charged the battery. Second time they replaced the battery. All the other times they would keep the Jeep a few days then tell me to come the Jeep because there is nothing wrong with it. Guess where my Jeep is today? In the Chrysler shop. 
      I have a case number with the Corp Management to no avail, they are a joke. As big as Chrysler is they should be ashamed ripping off the consumer with those problem cars. With all the complaints on the Web why is it that BBB or ConsumerAffairs have a class action lawsuit with Chrysler Jeeps. Health wise every time I go to my Jeep my heart starts racing of fear that the car will not start. What I am looking for a settlement by giving me back my down payment and monies which went to the bank each month. I do not want a replacement Jeep Right now. I have a loaner and you would not believe what make car it is. Chrysler 200 2016 and it feels like the Transmission is pulling as if it going to cut off.

By now these complaint should have hit the media instead of them talking about Kanye, & Kim, Taylor Swift & Beyonce etc. These guys are so pathetic and they are ruining my life.

"I immigrated from the RSA in Dec 2014 to Melbourne Australia. I purchased a Jeep Cherokee Longitude thinking this was my first choice of a family vehicle for safety aspects and to navigate me around the country as I am a foreigner. I paid cash for this vehicle and this vehicle had issues which needed to be rectified. The Sat Nav does not pronounce the street names correctly example going from one destination to another. It takes me across the ocean. Every time I take the vehicle to Jeep I keep getting the same story that Jeep is working on the software update. The paint work on the Jeep is not up to standard. Going on for 7 months of having the vehicle the paintwork that has been done, the paint work done is worse than before i.e. there is no orange peel left.
      In the 6 months that I have had the vehicle which I purchased from Bayside Jeep my vehicle has been there in the workshop for a period of 3 months. I'm still not satisfied with the work carried out. I have sent numerous emails and phoned telephonically for the Dealer Principal of the branch to please make contact with me urgently to no avail. Please could the Head Office of Jeep Australia contact me to address and resolve these problems. Let's hope we can resolve these issues amicably otherwise I will have no other choice but to take action against my statement above.
