"Everything with them is 24 to 48 hours and even then they don’t reach out and tell you your phone blocked them. Their number is not blocked and my spam blocker was never on. After 11 days of practically begging someone to help me I cancelled the Uconnect service, which by the way, they can do immediately and because “they bill monthly” I had to pay for the 11 days I did not have use of the service.",1.0
"So I went in to replace the hose radiator outlet 2 weeks ago on my compass tailhawk and still no part is available. If you're going to create a part made specifically for Jeep then at least have the decency to have the part available. They had to know this would happen because they used plastic for a part next to the engine which, of course, is going to melt. I've been a Jeep lover for my whole life and now will probably never purchase again because they no longer keep the customers in mind, it's all about how to create $ for the company. Let's create a part that can't be purchased by any other manufacturer and not make enough inventory for the part.
      This must be an ongoing problem because it's gonna be a month until the part will be ready. How do they expect people to function or be able to go to work; when that is the only means of transportation they have? If you're curious the part number is **. Also, every garage I ever took my Jeep to said that Ford and Jeep are what keep them all in business because of all the problems that arise. I stopped going to the dealership service center years ago because I never had a good experience. I've been to over 7 in different states and same results so something internally needs to be fixed. This was my 3rd and last Jeep I will ever purchase. Do better!",1.0
"I was so excited to buy a Jeep but turns out it is the worst decision I have ever made. Between Jeep, Jeep Customer Care, and Preston's (Dealership & Service) the experience has been nothing but a frustrating headache! Bought a brand-new Jeep and it is still under warranty, all work and upkeep has been done by the jeep certified dealership, had been taking it back to the dealership for months on months telling them there is something wrong with it, motor was ticking, was bogging down, and screen going haywire. After 8-9 months of back and forth and many appointments and tests they say my motor is blown, it is burning through oil, a new vehicle with 26,000 miles on it. Jeep and the dealership have no answers just excuses. Customer Care is ridiculous, it has been over 2 months and no fix or response, and just a blame game between Jeep and the dealership and excuses.",1.0
"The 2015 Jeep Wrangler Willy I purchased is a piece of junk and have had nothing but problems since purchasing it a year ago. I've wanted a Wrangler my entire life. I finally was in a place in my life to afford one and I'm really regretting it now and have deep resentments in which I am most disappointed and full of rage. Jeeps are supposed to be long-lasting, reliable, and dependable. I have had constant problems. I know the vehicle had 107,500 miles on it when I purchased it but Jeeps are supposed to last 200k miles with their engine no problem. I know used vehicles are going to require maintenance and upkeep, but Jeeps have a high resale value and when you purchase one that is 7-8 years old and for $23k, you expect it to last longer and not end with you regretting it I could have afforded a brand new one by now with how much I've spend out of pocket. 
      The only thing I see major in the carfax was a radiator replacement. Since I've had the car, the right turn signal doesn't work properly and the abs light came on. I had to replace the rear hub assembly within the first month of having the car due to it being a sensor and having to replace it to fix it which cost $500. I didn't bother spending almost $200 to fix the blinker. I've had the oxygen sensor replaced twice. I've had the thermostat housing replaced as well as the thermostat. The fan has run super loud and had to have the coolant burped. The Oil Filer Housing was replaced on 1/23/23. I've been dealing with overheating for all of 2023. I moved to NV from NC 4 weeks ago and drove 2k miles. It overheated the entire way there. I was not able to use cruise control, I had to keep it under 70 mph. I stopped at Firestone complete repair and they replaced the radiator cap because they said the coolant was overflowing into the overflow tank and I needed a new engine because it would just be a matter of time before a hose or head gasket blew. I BARELY made it to NV just past the Hoover Dam and my Jeep stopped climbing. I had to pull over, blast the heat, roll down the windows, and put my hazards on going 30 mph until I hit a hotel in Henderson on 7/4. It was over 100 degrees and had my dog with me. This vehicle has put our lives in danger for 4 days and probably countless other times. My Jeep has been sitting at Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep in North Las Vegas since 7/12. They did not return my calls, texts, or emails. I had to physically stop in there with a rental car (which I paid for out of pocket) to find out what was going on. They still had no answers for me on 7/21 and said they see this problem all the time with these Jeeps and overheating, radiators, and cooling issues. I can't believe Jeep continues to let this be a problem and disregards the face. I've found multiple forums of Jeep owners complaining about these issues (even practically brand new). I am probably going to advise everyone against buying Jeep/Chrysler and should have gone for a Bronco instead. This was a HUGE mistake buying Jeep. The dealership FINALLY notified me on 7/27 that I needed a new cylinder head and that my Route 66 warranty was not going to cover it. Instead, the warranty will cover a head gasket and labor and Orville at Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep said he has never not seen this covered (even the most basic of warranties). I called my credit union who finances my load and who sold me the extended warranty (4 years) and informed her of my poor experience with them and that they haven't covered anything since I've had this piece of junk. Jim Marsh says the repairs total $6,755.06. The extended warranty is covering $2,747.80 and after some kind of sad discount, I owe $4,007.26. I cannot and will not pay this as I simply cannot afford it and why would I pay this much when this vehicle is guaranteed to have continuous problems after this. It is a money pit and the biggest loss I can remember. I had to put my dog down last weekend unexpectedly after hospitalizing it for 3 days (the only companion I had in my new state). I had to start a Gofundme to help pay for the medical bills and euthanasia. I can't grieve properly because I'm so full of anger and frustration dealing with my vehicle that has caused incredible pain and suffering (financially, physically, mentally). The moving company I hired still hasn't brought my belongings and it's been over a month. I am a single man doing the best I can and I maxed out all my credit cards and this is probably the second lowest point of my life. I hope no one has to know what this feels like...to have to deal with these matters after losing my dog and being in a new place and not knowing anyone. I simply do not have the energy, finances, or mentality to keep fighting these fights and am ready to give up. Maybe I can hire a lawyer one day when I can afford it and make up for these losses in my life. I feel so betrayed by a company I once fantasized and dreamed about. Jeep still hasn’t responded to my claim and it’s been 2 weeks. They do not care about their customers or providing a satisfactory product.",1.0
"I’m a mail carrier from the Dakotas.. so I purchased a RHD Jeep Wrangler in 2021. A year later I had a manufacturing issue and now again. Not only are they trying to take 4 weeks to fix it, but they’re not helpful with a rental either. BOTH issues are manufacturing issues and not ONE person cares. Jeeps are cool.. but they don’t back them up or help their customers. Garbage.",1.0
"My name is Deborah. I purchased a 22 Compass in February with 3000 miles on it. I totally fell in love with this vehicle, it ran like a dream as new vehicles should. At 5000 miles, the engine started running rough and the transmission started shifting hard. I took it to a dealership per the recommendation of Jeep customer service who opened a case and said it had to be checked by a certified Chrysler technician who then checked it out and they did a software update to fix a shifting problem between gears 1 and 2. When asked why as an owner I had not been notified of this software update, they told me that the only way to find out there is a software update is when you take it to a dealership for something else.
      After the return of my Jeep, the transmission shifting became worse. When I returned to the dealership the same day, a technician rode with me and felt the issue I had been discussing. During the week that my Jeep was at the dealership multiple technicians drove it and felt the issue with the transmission. I received a written statement when I again picked up my Jeep with the same exact issues. The dealership returned it stating nothing was wrong with it because it showed no code. The Jeep customer service closed the case.Within a week, the transmission became worse. I called Jeep customer service again and opened a new case and was told to take it to another dealership for diagnosis. I did take it to another dealership per suggestion. They had it for less than 24 hours and drove it approximately 2 miles, according to my odometer. While picking up my Jeep, they told me the Jeep was fine as there was no code showing and transmissions were different now than they were years ago, and the problem was that the transmission was trying to learn how I drive. Um, I have had the vehicle since February, it would know how I drive. I again called Jeep customer service who said they would push the issue to the Jeep technician. I received an email stating they had closed the case as the vehicle was not at the dealership.As the issue worsened, I called Jeep customer service again and was told it had been checked multiple times with no code showing there was nothing they could do. I then mentioned contacting a Lemon Lawyer, and suddenly, I was told to take it back to the dealership and have them open a STAR case. I called the dealership to make an appointment. When the dealership was able to get my Jeep in for service again, I told them it was recommended by Jeep to open a STAR case. I called multiple times to check on the work's progress. I was told every time that communicating with Jeep and a STAR case was very slow because they communicate by email. The dealership had my Jeep for a month. I received a call from the service manager saying he needed me to come and drive the vehicle so he could feel what I was talking about. I stopped by to drive the Jeep, while stopping the first time, the Jeep Jerked while downshifting. His explanation was the auto start/stop, which I turned off as I do not like it. The second time I had a problem with the shifting was taking off to accelerate. His explanation was that sometimes when stopping, the vehicle does not know which gear to be in, so it will jerk. At the time, I was accelerating not slowing down. At this point, I just told them to close the ticket and give me the Jeep back as they were not interested in trying to fix the problem. When checking out, I was told by the customer service technician that they had worked on my Jeep for about an hour. They had my Jeep for a month and worked on it for an hour. Unacceptable.I cannot take this back to the dealership I purchased it from because it has a mechanical issue, so I am stuck with a vehicle that is still running rough and a transmission that continues to shift hard. What do I do? Wait for it to die? Wait for it to stop while I am driving? This is a safety issue. Jeep customer service is blowing me off. I am looking for a Lemon Law Lawyer to help me. If Jeep does not help me with my Jeep, I will find someone who will.",1.0
"I leased my 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee in October 2022. Not long after I noticed the Auto-Stop feature did not work. In the beginning I had to flood the brake as hard as possible to get it to work sometimes. After a very short time of having it just stopped working in its entirety. I made an appointment with Jeep to get it checked out. I dropped off the car and was informed there was a fuse that had to be replaced and that may have been the reason it was not working. I picked up my vehicle and as I drove home I noticed the feature was not working. I called Jeep again and brought it back in on a different date. This visit was less satisfying because they just told me nothing could be done because they were not getting any codes from their machine.
      I was so disappointed because I invested in this vehicle to have all the feature that it came with. Fast forward to about one month ago when I came to my car after a long day of work to find out my car was completely dead. Only after a few hours and many attempts to boost it finally turned on. The next morning I woke up to go to work and my car was completely dead again, I had to get another boost. I decided to take it to the Jeep dealer service not to far from my house in hopes I could get an answer as to why my brand new car was doing this. They said they couldn’t help same day and would have to leave my car there until they could check it out. I took a cab to drop my child off and then another cab to work.I got a call two days later that both batteries had to be replaced on my brand new car with approximately 3000 miles. After picking up my vehicle as I was driving all the the sensors on the dashboard started to pop up on the pop every two minutes including the emergency brake light and check engine light. I was freaking out because imagine driving a vehicle with all these sensor alerts on the highway with your child. I contacted the service person via email and send him a picture of what was happening. He encouraged me to bring it in that it wasn’t normal to do that. I took it back and they said about 30 codes pop up and a fuse had to be replaced. I pick up my car the next few days and the issue was still happening.I take the vehicle again and they were saying no codes were going up and without that there’s nothing that can be done. I explained how unsafe this was and that as a customer this was unacceptable. My car has been back and forth to get serviced all month. I am extremely disappointed. I wish I never decided on the brand Jeep. It seems to be unsafe and when things are failing doesn’t seem like servicing it would help with “no codes” come up in their computer. I would like to know what can be done about this and the safety and peace of mind of consumers who invest in this product.",1.0
"AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP AT ALL COST. The Director of Sales Michael ** is the most disrespectful, rude, condescending and homophobic customer service person we have ever had to deal with. Jeep should be ashamed to be represented by this type of person. This was the worst possible car sales and customer service experience we have ever had. We bought a new car on a Saturday and on Sunday when we noticed the alignment was off we brought it back to be serviced. It was serviced and in less than a week we had the same problem again. We brought it back to be serviced a second time and again in less than a week the alignment was off. In addition to that, every single warning light possible would come on randomly when driving the car. 
      At this point we contacted the Director of Sales Michael ** and told him we wanted a different car. We were told that he would look into the matter and get us out of the car and into another one. Later that day we were contacted by our salesman Tyler ** who told us he was asked to have us come in so we could pick another car on the lot and that they were going to work out the same deal even if it was at a loss for the dealership in order to make us happy and to make up for all of the inconveniences and problems we’ve had with the car. We went into the dealership on Friday and were told by the Director of Sales Michael ** that we had to wait until Monday so that he could have his service technician look at the car and get us into a loaner while also telling us that the car he could get us into was not on the lot. Not only were we lied to and manipulated, but we were also disrespected for being gay. The Director of Sales Michael ** was extremely rude and inappropriate in his interactions with us. To the point where he dismissed us by telling us he was going to contact Chrysler and undo the sale of the car. Apparently if it wasn’t this defective car, they were not interested in selling us a car. A car that initially they were very aggressive in getting us to purchase. We are now left without a car and having wasted almost a month in dealing with a car that should have never been sold.",1.0
"We purchased a new Right Hand Drive Jeep Wrangler in February 2021 (Chief blue) and a second in September of 2021 (Granite Crystal gray). In November of 2022, the wheel speed sensor went in the gray one. It is now March of 2023, and Jeep still doesn't have the part and has no date that the part will be in. This has put this Jeep with less than 50,000 miles on it out of commission! Jeep has done nothing but offer placating replies with absolutely no results! The lack of speed sense causes the Jeep to have no traction control, ABS, 4-wheel drive, cruise control, electronic stabilizer and the check engine light is on. We live in New York and it is winter sp this 2021 Jeep is worthless! I am beyond frustrated that a company as large as Jeep has done absolutely nothing to resolve this situation!",1.0
This vehicle was leased in April 2022 and has now been at the dealer waiting for a new motor. Jeep continues to say that they are waiting on the new engine.  This has been since October 2022 and has been in the shop longer than on the road. I have tried working with Jeep on a resolution but they continue to drag their feet. I requested a buyback and they said that it may cost a fee to do so. Not sure how it works but it would be nice if this company would stand up for their product and hold themselves responsible for poor quality.,1.0
"Never had such horrible service on anything I have ever purchased - let alone a $60K Jeep Gladiator - brand new - driven off the lot with 6 miles. Things happen, but the response and service has been worse than imaginable. Nobody even cares, calls, updates, nothing. The car has 1,900 miles, was towed into the dealer and we hear nothing. JEEP Wave service reaches out, we call back, nothing! (Thanks Brandi - for NOTHING). This is my 4th JEEP and this is the treatment. Never again based on the response so far. Inexcusable. If I operated like this, I would be out of business.",1.0
"Consider yourself warned. At 47,000 miles my Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT ($70,000 vehicle) had the lifters fail which is a widely reported issue. As a result, the cam shaft deflected metal particles into the engine block which now requires me to put an entirely new motor into the vehicle. Roughly $10,000 in damages and repairs. These types of damages are not covered under comprehensive insurance, you will be left holding the bag and Fiat/Jeep/Chrysler will NOT HELP YOU AT ALL. My car was perfectly maintained at all times, this is a defective engine design and if you're in the market for one of these vehicles BEWARE. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere, do not buy these vehicles. They are plagued with issues and you will cause yourself an enormous headache.",1.0
"Got my dreamy Jeep gladiator 2 months ago, it’s most expensive mistake I ever have, comes back to the dealership first injector number 2/3, got it back a day later the car stops and have to be towed back to the dealership, now they said is injector 4. Still there at this moment.",1.0
"I have 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L that was bought back in January of 2022 drove it up til April 17th. My wife was pulling of a parking lot and the transmission went into limp mode. Had it towed to the dealership 3 days later got it back and they said they did software updates. Drove it for a week and while my whole family was in it and taking a turn from a stop sign when they got up to 15mph it through itself in park and the transmission clicked loudly. Had it towed again to the dealership where it sat there for 56 days before getting it back with a new transmission. 
      I called Jeep customer service several times and got a case manager involved. I only heard from her one time on May12th. I have asked for the vehicle to be bought back under Lemon Law which states that if your vehicle is in the shop for 30 days or more within the first year or same defect of the vehicle at least 3 times they buy it back. I would have to say I will never buy another FCA unit again. The dealership had no communication with me nor did the FCA customer service. When I called to talk to a supervisor they would never send me to one or have one call me back. The dealership didn’t want me to take back my vehicle on a 3 1/2 hr trip because they didn’t want me to break down again. So either they aren’t sure it was the transmission or they aren’t sure the new one will hold up.",1.0
"We recently bought a 2022 Jeep Gladiator, after four days of owning it problems started. It has been at Kindle dealership (cmch) numerous times and every time they tell us it's fixed it's not. They have replaced numerous parts and still having issues. The dealership itself is awful and I'm upset we even chose to go there. Service is awful, they never answer phones, rude customer service, and absolutely no respect or concern for our situation. JEEP says they started the buy back but it's going nowhere. 
      My husband is getting deployed in two weeks, we are moving to a new state with four kids and three animals. We needed this Jeep to help us with the move. How can service be so bad? How can you expect people to drop a massive amounts of money on vehicles that don't work or even give them the service they deserve. This has been so stressful for us and not to mention financial hardship. We are paying for a brand new broken vehicle and having to get rentals twice now just so we can function as a large family. Jeep needs to do better for their customers and I don't not recommend Kindle dealership at all. Please someone see this and light a fire under someone's butt. We leave in two weeks and my husband will be on a boat. I will not have time to deal with this on my own with everything else going on. Jeep you have a massive problem on your hands! Do something please!!!!",1.0
"Where do I begin. Long story short, I purchased a 2021 Jeep Gladiator which I started off loving. I've leased Acura's most of my life. Here we are today, not even a year later and my Gladiator has left me stranded on the Turnpike. It's still under warranty but it's as good as nothing. They towed it to 2 different dealers because first dealer was telling me that they will not have anyone to look at the Jeep until AFTER 30 days and no rentals/loaners available and second dealer told me same but they had a rental they could provide. Transmission was declared damaged. On a BRAND NEW Jeep. We can all say that we purchase nee vehicles to avoid problems like this right? Well, not in my case. I have never owned a brand new car, or even old cars; that have given me these issues. 
      I have been in contact with Jeep and no one there has been helpful at all. I keep getting that my case manager will call me back and no calls at all. I have called them 5 times today and have gotten re-routed to an incorrect department, 5 times today. Keep in mind that I am still paying a loan on this vehicle and that I am also paying for a very expensive MOPAR service that I am not even using. I would not recommend Jeep to my worst enemy!!!",1.0

"Bought a 2021 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in July of 2021 for $63,000. Within a few months rust started to form on top of the rear bumper around the mounting bolts and streaming a rust stain around the rear steel bumper. The dealer declined repairs so I contacted Jeep customer service and opened a case and claim. They also denied the claim stating the rust was from ""outside influence"" whatever that means. I am furious that they would let a simple repair like this leave a customer furious and hating the car because of this. There are several others online with similar issues and a class action suit has been launched. My theory is it shouldn't have to come to this when paying a TON of $ for this car. I am still willing to speak to Jeep about coming to an amicable outcome.",1.0
"Berthod Motors in Glenwood Springs, CO and its corporate affiliates left my wife and I stranded for the holidays. After having paid out of pocket for a PCM replacement on our Jeep Grand Cherokee that also fried our battery and alternator last December, my Jeep began exhibiting the same issues as before at the beginning of this December. The PCM failed and fried a battery. I contacted Berthod Motors only to be told that while the part was still under warranty, it would be 2 weeks before a mechanic could even look at our vehicle to assess if it was truly the PCM that had failed again. Without option, we booked an appointment.
      I had our Jeep towed to Berthod the night before our scheduled appointment. The day of the appointment came and went with 0 contact from the dealership, although I had tried to call and left multiple messages. I had been left with no idea that the vehicle had even made it to the dealership. I was finally contacted by the service manager the following day saying that it was in fact a PCM failure, but due to not having one in stock, it would be another week before the repair would be made. It has now been 2 weeks with no end in sight.After once again not being contacted by Berthod Motors with an update to the status of the repair, I stopped in and was informed that the PCM is on backorder. The EARLIEST that the part could be available is mid January, 6 weeks after the vehicle broke down due to a faulty part being installed by Jeep. I was told by Jason, the service manager, that his hands were tied as far as not being able to make the repair any quicker or providing a rental car in between. Jason directed me to Jeep's direct customer service to see if they could be any help. I contacted Jeeps Corporate customer service line on Monday of this week. I explained my wife and I’s situation to the representative and while she was very kind, she informed me that she would have to escalate the situation and that she didn’t have the resources to actually help. It took another 48 hours for a different representative to call. Without hesitation the representative told my wife and I that there isn’t even a chance that Jeep would be willing to help us with a rental car and we would be so lucky to get the replacement PCM any quicker than what we were quoted from Berthod. This will be my wife and I’s last vehicle from General Motors. My wife, a teacher, has been a huge fan of Jeep since she has had her driver’s license. She has personally financed over 5 different models of Jeep Cherokees since our marriage. Already last week she suggested that we move over to a more dependable brand such as Toyota after this debacle. As a plumber in this valley, I could never stay in business, let alone stay employed if this is how I treated my clients. I would never think of or have the audacity to install a faulty part in a client's home and then leave them without water or heat after the part failed. Regardless of backordered parts. This has truly been one of the worst examples of customer care that I have seen in my life. This review will be updated as the situation progresses.",1.0
My Grand Cherokee is one of the best vehicles I've had. The seats could be a lot better far as comfort and the replacement parts are expensive. But I like the design of the whole car in general. My Jeep has been great. Just keep up the maintenance on your vehicle.,5.0
"Owned car since July 2021. Today 11-4-21 it sits in shop again for bad Uconnect screen/controls. No reliable screen means no climate control, radio, nav, phone connection.

"I leased 2021 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited 4xe couple months back from Stoneridge (Livermore) where started facing an issue with hybrid sign at odometer after couple months. Meanwhile, I went to close by dealership i.e. ELK Grove Jeep where they recognized or analyzed an issue with electric wiring needs to replace because those got burned out due to engineering or mechanical issue. Beside, they gave an estimate first for 1 week from fixation perspective and now they are keep on ignoring since September 2021.
      Moreover, I also talked to Jeep Customer service and also raised the case includes escalation where case Manager is careless as well and not responsive because they never reached out to me even single time about the status or any feedback. I'm literally fed up and stressed because they are harassing and ignoring customer instead of helping. Also, I requested them that my health is not good and I can't bear stress due to lung infection after covid19 impact but I want to state here on public side as well and manifest there carelessness about team services.

"7/1/21 I was in a terrible car accident on the interstate. 28k damage to my Jeep Wrangler!

"I've now owned five Jeeps. Two Grand Cherokees and three Wranglers (two JK models and one JL model). While I've had a hiccup or two, Jeep has been great about making things right and the vehicles have been reliable. The reliability and versatility have kept me a loyal Jeep customer. Recently, and unfortunately, we were the victims of an F-250 Super Duty red light running hit-and-run driver that hit us and ran totaling the vehicle with only 4980 miles. Me, my wife, daughter, and son, all walked away the kids with zero injuries and my wife and I with minimal airbag related injuries. To say I am thankful is an understatement. I'm so bummed that I lost so much of what I invested in my Jeep and am having trouble finding a replacement, but at the end of the day, we all walked away from a collision that had we been in a smaller vehicle, there would have likely been severe injuries or even death.

"I have 2 Jeeps. One is a 2012 Jeep Patriot that has minor issues that haven't cost a ton. The other is a 2017 Jeep Compass that has had major financial issues recently. I have an extended warranty on the 2017 Jeep as I bought it used. I took it to my local Jeep dealership when it started hesitating and engine lights went on. They claimed it was a spark plug, maintenance issue that cost me over 500 dollars. 
      Then less than 2 months later same issues same lights on. I took it back to dealership and they diagnosed it with a throttle body problem that was going to cost me an additional 700 dollars (not under warranty). I towed it away but had to pay the 130 for the diagnostic problem they should have seen/fixed the first time. My 2012 Jeep has a 4wd light on ever since I took it to same dealership to fix a recall problem. My honest mechanic said the dealership pinched the wires when they fixed the recall problem.

"DO NOT BUY JEEP! Please look into other credible vehicle brands. Please believe ALL the reviews about their terrible service! First of all, let me first say initially my car is fairly new. It is still under warranty, and it started stalling. Well I find out via mail it’s a recall on the electric system that starts the issue ok... ""Well my car isn’t driving properly. Can you all pick it up?"" ""Well let us get back with you.. Yes we can."" My car gets to the dealership. They won’t service my car unless I sign some paperwork. ""Understandable. Can you do e-docusign?"" ""No."" ""Can you pick me up?"" ""No."" ""Can you bring the papers to my home?"" ""No."" I had to hire an Uber to jeep and back $40. 
      ""When will my car be fixed?"" ""We don’t know."" Dealership calls back.. ""Can’t fix your car ma’am. We are backed up 4 days."" ""Can you provide a loaner car?"" ""No."" ""Why?"" ""Corporate says it must be a service that requires at least 48 hours. Your service only takes 20 minutes."" I spent almost a wk getting a Uber back and forth to work $100. A week after my car is fixed, car stalls out again on a major highway. I’m almost killed! At this point I’m ANGRY. Same thing. No loaner car, I can’t get to the dealership to sign off, I spent OVER $200 on appointment cancellations, Uber rides, and food delivery services! No rentals are available in my area. ""We gave you a case manager. She’s not available until Monday morning. You will have to wait..."" Guess who will be doing Uber again on Monday morning?? DO NOT buy Jeep. The customer service is terrible. I get better service buying a $3 chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A than I have buying a 32,000 vehicle!! I’m filing a suit, giving bad reviews until the day I die!

"I want to start off by saying that I come from a family of multiple Jeep owners (husband, mom, dad, brother, mother-in-law, etc.) as we all love Jeep. More so, I was looking forward to purchasing a second vehicle for myself (of course a Jeep) because they have been reliable cars, or so I thought, and I had faith in the Jeep Company. That was until my unfortunate and super expensive experience that has kickstarted my 2021 year. While driving back home shortly after New Year’s Day, my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee with only 66K miles, suddenly decided not to turn back on after stopping for gas. Fortunately, I was able to tow it to the nearest Jeep dealership, where I only go to for car service. Since it was the holidays, there was a delay in my car's diagnostic. 
      After 4 days of being at the Jeep dealership, I was finally informed that my fuel pump and wiring had to be replaced for about $1,500 plus tax because nothing that needed repair was covered under warranty. Now, let's add $1,500 plus tax to the total cost that I have been incurring with rental car, stay, food, etc. since my 2015 Jeep, with only 66k miles, stopped working while I was 4 hours away from home. I decided to call the Jeep warranty customer care to get clarification on what is covered in my warranty. After speaking with several customer care agents, they all shared that my fuel pump is covered under the manufacturer’s warranty for up to 7 years or 100K miles, which conflicted with what the Jeep dealership shared. Additionally, I was told that I had trip interruption protection for up to 100K, which would help with all the costs I was incurring being 4 hours away from home. Unfortunately, the Jeep car dealership and the Jeep warranty customer care were not agreeing, which caused additional delays in my car getting fixed. After speaking with various customer care numbers for 2 days that were being provided to me by each representative, it was finally confirmed that my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee’s fuel pump and wiring was not covered under any warranty. Additionally, the trip interruption plan that I was told I had, was indeed not true. Now I understand that rules are rules. However, this experience has left me with 2 burning questions: 1) How reliable are Jeep cars to break down at only 66K miles? 2) How reliable is the Jeep Company with ensuring proper employee training so that customers are not misled? -Sincerely disheartened by Jeep!",1.0
"I bought this car brand new and have now had it for 2 years. It has been the worst car I have ever had in my life. The windshield is a magnet for chips and you can tell that it is bad quality, have had two chips and one crack already driving on paved roads. The paint is also cheap as it chips very easily with normal driving. And the biggest issue other than all the recalls, is that my car takes the most expensive oil which is full synthetic and for some reason it is empty at 3,000 miles. Have taken it to the dealer and even called Jeep and nobody seems to be able to fix the issue. They just tell me to keep adding oil because these cars are notorious for doing that.
      It is a safety issue because the car stalls while driving since it is constantly running out of oil, but neither the dealers or jeep seem to care. That's not to mention all the problems I had with the radio trying to get Android Auto to work properly, jeep kept telling me that the problem was I needed new usb cable but in the end I found out on my own that the actual problem were the apps on the radio. Basically jeep never has answers to anything, you have to figure it out on your own like you are the one getting paid to do the job. Best thing I can do now is get rid of this jeep and never do business with them again.",1.0

Im a disabled unemployed Iraq war veteran, but hey apparently Jeep doesn't care about the soldiers and veterans to even remotely make it right or do anything to help.... I shouldn't have to foot this bill for a new engine in such a new vehicle.... Absolutely garbage customer service and helpfulness in a persons time of need....

"I purchased a brand new Jeep Compass in September 2015. I owned jeeps previously but not a compass and never had problems like I am having now. At 3 years old my compass radio went out and needed to be replaced the car has 30,000 miles on it but the radio was not covered under warranty. It cost me 450.00 to replace it. In 2019 at 4 years old I needed a new wheel bearing and had to replace front and back breaks rotors and pads to the tune of over 800.00. Car had 35,000 miles on it. In June of 2020 a sensor for the battery went and car would not start. I had to have it towed to the dealer for 200.00. The sensor cost 12 dollars but I was charged 300.00 for 2 hours of labor. Now the 4wd, traction control light and ABS light all came on.
      When I took it to my local mechanic he said the wiring for these sensors was all corroded and would need to be replaced. He did not give me an estimate but told me it would be very expensive. The car has 42,000 miles on it. I am very disgusted and would not recommend this vehicle to anyone. I called Jeep and they told me they Couldnt help as my warranty ended Sept. 9 2020. Nice Company!",2.0
"I feel bad I have to write this but....I bought a Jeep Compass back in March 2019 from the Route 46 Jeep Dealership in Little Falls, NJ. DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP!!! IT IS TERRIBLE. I had to wait over an hour until they found the vehicle I was inquiring about. Then the finance guy, Alex **, was awful in giving me all of the details of my loan. Very rushed and basically didn't care about what was best for me. I was told the Compass was certified and when i went to sign the papers, it was not for the amount quoted online as the sales price. I had to pay an additional 1200 for the certified fee! This was not disclosed or mentioned in any paperwork until I sat down with the finance person at the last minute. Very unprofessional. I waited to speak to the manager of the dealership before I left, but he was conveniently unavailable for over an hour.
      Next issue-had car serviced at the Morgantown, WV dealership in October 2019. Then in June 2020, the car stalls out on me. I had vehicle towed to a White Plains, NY dealership. Issue was that the Morgantown dealership left screws of the torque plate in the car and they punched a hole in my motor and transmission. Now I find out the parts are not coming in until October 2020. I have been without a vehicle from June 2020 and will not get my car until October 2020. Jeep is not helping me at all!

Issues include..paint lift, no working seatbelts, lock out, lockdown, screen went blank then horizontal lines, jerking, won't start, won't accept gas, radio on and off.. I have asked right away for Jeep to take it back when I had no working seat belts on day one but no reply.. They did repair the seatbelts...

Do not buy a Compass. 2.4 litre motor burns 1qt of oil per 2000 miles and that meets Jeeps criteria for a good motor. Back up camera worthless if car driven on other than dry pavement and no back up sensors. Gears 8 & 9 will not maintain speed even on flat roads. Rear window defroster fails to clear window as melt builds up on the wiper making it worthless. Snow slush and mud build up on the tire causing all wheels to become unbalanced. Who pays for a at of oil every 2000 miles and why isn't that fact listed in specs? My second Jeep - first and last. What car would you buy knowing it'll use a at of oil every 2000 miles?

"Crooked Dealership! Lemon Cars Stay Away!! If I Could Give Negative stars I Would! ...So less than 2 months ago I purchased a 2012 Jeep Compass with 123k miles. Financed through Pronto Finance out of Schaumburg, Illinois. 1st month in vehicle stalled out while pulling up to a stop sign. Just this week the car has stalled out 6 times all while driving on the freeway! One of those times with my 5 year old daughter making a U Turn during rush hour! Car in the middle of the road! Every time this happens, it literary takes 5 or more minutes to start back up again! Did some research online and apparently this is a known issue with other Compass owners and Chrysler intends to do nothing about it until someone gets killed in an accident! 
      I called the salesman ""Jorge"" and he told me to call the finance company because he ""thinks"" it has a warranty? Hello! I bought a used car as is. Of course it has no warranty!. Just getting the runaround from everyone but rest assured I'm taking matters into my own hands. I'm going to make a special YouTube Channel to document every time this vehicle stalls out or goes into ""limp mode"". Going to put them all on blast until this matter is corrected or that crooked dealership shuts its doors for good!!!

"Sunday my Jeep 2019 Compass 13,000 miles wouldn’t start because of “software malfunction.” Got roadside assistance Monday morning to get it towed from a shopping center the car stopped at to dealer. Next day they gave me the car saying it’s fixed. Next morning same thing happened. I was in school so I arranged the car to get towed from my school. No one came for an hour so I called back and roadside said it was no records of it. I created another request of roadside around noon. They promised to pick it up within 60 min. At 7pm I called the dealer to see if it was dropped off and they had no record of it. I called back roadside assistance and the pick up was cancelled. No one called or texted to let me know. Then they said sorry. They arranged for my towing. It will be there in 60min.
      It’s 8pm. I still don’t know if my car has been picked up, towed, stolen (because they tell you to leave the keys inside the car). God knows what would happen. There you have it, Jeep Warranty roadside assistance. It’s been 8hrs and I have no idea what’s going on with my car. I could have been stranded on the side of the road with a baby and they wouldn’t know I need help.

I own or I should say paying to own my Jeep. I have had it for 3 years. So far it has been dependable. Not a fan of how the transmission works. It shifts but not always when it needs to.

Other than tires and a realignment its been trouble free. I would recommend a Jeep Compass.,4.0

"My son purchased a used 2011 Jepp Liberty with the sky slider roof in 2017. The car was in excellent condition when we purchased it in 2017. Low miles, clean and in great running condition. However no one ever notified us of the horror that was about to happen with the sky slider roof. As cool as it looks and opens, the roof is a piece of garbage. 
      One warm summer night my son decided to open the roof to get some fresh air in the car only to find once he got home that the roof was never to close again. We tried and tried but to our dismay the roof would just not close. SO then the next step was to call Jeep. We just about got laughed at on the phone, with the service men telling us they no longer make the parts for the 2011 Jeep Liberty and basically we were screwed. Hmmm a 2011 and no parts. How can you explain that. Now what do we do with this car??? We can not sell it, we can not trade it in, we ARE STUCK!!! Now we have contacted an auto body shop that can possibly take a roof from a Jeep Liberty with the same sky slider roof, that was in an accident and put it on my son's vehicle.... for $3,000 dollars. So now, my son still owes $7,000 on the car and we HAVE to invest another $3,000 just so he can drive the damn car. I will never ever buy another JEEP in my life.

All I’m looking for is 1 free oil change so I don’t have to pay $150 in a month for 2 oil changes. I’m really starting to rethink buying a Jeep. Especially knowing how they can't help me at all. They couldn’t even get a hold of the dealership to even speak to them. That right there should tell you how great they are. If I could have given it a zero or even lower I would have.",1.0
"I was one of the very first to sign up and order an all new Jeep Gladiator Launch Edition. It has been a botched launch ever since the beginning. The website pre-order not working correctly, promised a ""white glove"" concierge experience with no contact from them, the factory pumping out Jeeps for orders that were placed months after mine, and now delivery...As I type this it sits in a lot waiting on truck to bring it two hours to the dealership..for an entire month it has been sitting there. The chat is of no help and my salesman says FCA won't let him send someone just to pick it up. Starting to wonder why I am buying this if this is how Jeep treats its customers.",1.0
"Jeep Extended Warranty Scam! If you just bought a New Jeep and you opt for the Lifetime Warranty then you have just been SCAMMED! Here is what happened to me, to prove my point. I bought a New 2017 Jeep Renegade on Jan 2018. After some thought and searching for an Extended Vehicle Protection plan, I decide to go with Mopar’s Vehicle Protection (MVP). So, I called Mopar, and the salesman told me that as soon as the Manufacturer Warranty ends then, the Extended Warranty would kick in!
      Well, Folks, This Was a Major Lie! The salesman NEVER said that this replaces your Manufacturer Warranty the Day that you buy it! AND it will automatically insert itself back to the date that you bought the vehicle! So, basically, you are paying for the Manufacturer Warranty! How stupid do I feel? I feel very stupid at this point! Who in their right mind would pay for a warranty that is FREE for 5 years? I know if I was told that this warranty would take the place of the Manufacturer Warranty from the time you bought it, I would say, “Hell-NO!” This is a Major SCAM People!So, I called Mopar (800-521-9922) and asked to speak to Admin to tried to explain that the Salesman at Mopar lied to me by not telling me that this Warranty would run Concurrent with the Manufacturer Warranty (Take its place) and that I would be paying for my warranty from the get-go! Now I don’t know about you folks, but who in their right mind would pay for something that is given to them for FREE? So, I tried to explain this to “Danu”. I don’t know the spelling of his name, but that is how he said it when I talked to him on June 28, 2019, @ 12 PM Mtz. He told me that this is correct and that I will get a refund back minus $1000 for the time that I was on this Extended Warranty Protection plan from Mopar, even though, Mopar (Jeep) was already given me for 5 year or 60,000 miles for free! I asked to speak to a supervisor of Manager and he said there isn’t any and then transfer me to a survey on how well this call went! LOL, of course, I gave the LOWEST possible score that I could give him! And, I kissed my $1000 goodbye! Needless to say, Jeep has just put another unhappy customer on the street to tell the masses what is going on behind the curtain of deception! So, people if you feel like being SCAMMED And throwing your money down the ** then just opt into the Jeep Lifetime Warranty Program!

"I have been dealing with many ongoing issues with my 2006 Jeep Commander 3.7 6 cylinder. I have called them & emailed the company on several occasions about my dash lights just coming on & losing all power as I am driving. It's very scary because I always have my 13 yr old in the vehicle. No code comes up on the scanner when I have brought it in several times to the garage. Jeep Chrysler says they have not heard of this issue. I have found many many people with this issue online. Very discouraged with the same issue. There is so many wires & control panels in this vehicle it makes me nervous that some of these wires are fried & nobody can find it. 
      I am exhausted with paying out of pocket with this vehicle. Yes it's a 2006 but I can not afford anything else & I have had it for 5 yrs now. These issues started about 1 1/2-2 yrs ago. I loved this vehicle & with me driving everywhere for my daughters sports it's worked. Now I get nervous & I don't trust it. Which makes me very sad. This vehicle has made me stopped doing stuff that I used to. That's no way to live. I love Jeeps but this is making me not want to buy a Jeep again. It's something I can't keep putting money into. The issue I also have is the service engine light. That's the catalytic converter. My mechanic told me to check with Jeep because it is something well known for breaking in them & there could be a recall. I did check & again they didn't know what I was talking about. This is the 2nd converter I've put in the vehicle in 5 yrs. The paperwork from the 1 previous owner had also done it 2 yrs before I purchased it in 2014. Which in my previous vehicle that I had for 10 yrs not once did I put a catalytic converter in. After reviewing several reviews from Jeep Commander owners I decided to write a review out of frustration. I really would like to think Jeep would do the right thing especially with our kids always in our vehicle & future Jeep buyers deciding to not buy another Jeep. Thank you.",2.0
"My husband and I have been lifelong Jeep owners, until now. We decided to upgrade our 2013 2 door Freedom Edition to a 2019 Mojito Wrangler 4 door Rubicon. We special ordered it exactly the way we wanted. Spent months researching and looking at Jeeps so that we would get the perfect car. We sold our 2013 outright about 2 weeks before ours was delivered. We waited almost a month for it to come into the dealer. Not ideal but ok it takes awhile to put a car together right? Dealer finally called us and we drove two hours to pick up our new toy. It was pouring when we got there which was disappointing, but now looking back that was a godsend.
      During inspection we found scratches all over interior panels, and spots on the doorsills where the paint was chipped down to bare metal. Could get over that.Then during the test drive the car pulled to the right, and had thunking noise upon breaking, along with huge dent in the steering wheel at the top right where you put your hand. (We're told it was a manufacturer defect.) But the final straw was when we pulled it in and found the Sky One roof leaking in the back and discovered the carpet in the back was soaked. Further inspection found that on the passenger side the Sky One roof was not smooth but wrinkled and had a piece of the frame/metal pushing up thru it. For an almost $60,000 vehicle this was not acceptable and we did not take delivery of what was supposed to be our dream Jeep. It was heartbreaking to us as we were so excited to get this car. Dealer tried to place an order for another car but it is no longer available to order. What????Now we are dealing with Jeep Cares. (Really should be called something else.) Two weeks of the runaround of someone will call you - no calls, we assigned a manager they will call - no call. You get the picture. Now finally after many hours on the phone someone finally called us. What we have been offered is talk to your dealer and have them place an order - well they can't. Then we can fix the car they have and you can have that one. Why in the world would I want a car with 8 miles on it that has to be taken apart and rebuilt to fix issues that should never have been there. This feels like they just want to pass off the problems to us; because let's be real here... there will be nothing but problems with a vehicle like this.We have searched other dealers nationwide and have not been able to find a Jeep dealer with the color and options that we wanted; they either have $5,000 more of options or are missing options that are important to us. Final piece is during the time this has all taken we have had two incentives from Jeep expire with no way of recouping the $1,500 for those offered either. At this point we are waiting for them to come up with something other than accepting a Jeep that is subpar. Overall not a great experience not anything that would make me want to do this ever again with Jeep.",1.0
"Jeep does not takes care of their customer in all fairness. I purchase a 2016 Jeep Renegade Latitude back in November 2016 at Suresky in Goshen NY. In the beginning of 2018 I started getting an issue with my car. I had oil consumption issue. Engine light would come on and the car would feel like as if it’s going to shutdown. Every time I would take to get my oil change, the mechanic would tell me that I have barely have any oil. So I took it to where I purchase the car and explained to them that my issues are with my car. So they did their inspection and testing and at the end they told me that the oil consumption was normal. Mind you I had 45,995 miles and still under warranty. 
      April 29 2019 my car started blowing white smoke out of my tailpipe. Was unable to drive the vehicle home. Following day I took it to the nearest Jeep dealer around my job Croton Auto Park, Croton on Hudson, NY. They did a diagnostic and found #3 cylinder misfires, all my spark plugs are full of oil, a piece of spark plug was found inside the engine and a piece of the piston was to found inside the engine. I called the Jeep FCA opened a case. One of the representatives that helped me open my case told me that my issue with my car was common. She has handled a few of the same issues. The service Manager at the Croton Auto Park also told me that these are very common with the model of my car. I was told that to fix the car it would cost $12,000.00 and the Jeep were only willing to pay $8000 and I have to come up with the other $4000 out of pocket.  Now I am 67,000 miles (7000) over the warranty and was told that this is their last offer. I believe that I should not have to pay for any of this because if this was addressed when I brought it in the day that I was still covered under warranty and below the mileage I wouldn’t need to pay anything. This is a manufacture defect. A 2 1/2 year old car having this kind of issues is unheard of. I provided proof of maintenance records. I am a loyal customer with Jeep. I had a 2003 and 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 2016 Jeep Wrangler and now 2018 Jeep Renegade Latitude. I have never had a bad experience with Jeep till now. This is the worst experience I ever had. I am going to continue to post all this in all social media until I am heard and acknowledge.",1.0
"My husband and I bought a 2017 Jeep Renegade Trailhawk the year it came out. Since then, we've had several issues pop up. One of the major issues is that the car is sluggish and won't accelerate fast enough. There's an under-powered engine and a transmission that's clunky and seems to jump gears. For example: When the car slows down it jumps gears. I can foresee that this could be a major safety issue at some point.
      At about 20,000 miles or so, we had to bring the Jeep into the dealership to get fixed because the remote start wouldn't work properly, the paint was already chipping off of the Trailhawk emblem and the seatbelt wasn't installed properly and was clicking. Jeep had this car priced at around $30,000 with all of these issues. My husband and I wanted to trade in the Jeep and they were only going to offer a trade in amount of about $15,000. My father always said that a car is nothing but a pit to throw your money in. Some pits are a lot deeper (cough cough: JEEP!). And this one you're better off just passing by.",1.0

"I got a 2018 Jeep Wrangler that is trailer rated. I paid $42,000 for it for the fact that I like to go off road. On New Year's Eve my wife was coming home in a downpour on the highway when the jeep just stop running. She pulled over to get out of the way. She tried starting it a couple of times and nothing. I went and picked her up 150 miles away and had it towed to my house. I called the dealer and had to wait 14 days before they could look at it.
      Two days later I got a call that water got into the motor and it would be $12,000 for a new one. I asked what about my 7 year 100 mile warrant they said it is not covered. I called Chrysler and they said no good. I looked up what trail rated stood for and it said that the jeep could go in water up to 19 to 30 inches. When I said that to them they said that does not mean rain. So to fix my jeep I had to go through my insurance. I will never buy a Chrysler again and have told my friends not to use that dealer or buy a Chrysler. P.s. I work in a company where there 46,000 employees and I posted this on their website.",1.0

One time I actually thought someone had hit me from behind. Took it back to dealer... can’t find anything wrong... Then last month I took it to another dealer... they found a cylinder misfiring... yeah sounds safe to me. Started doing it again after getting the car back for 3 days.

"My 2019 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk with 19,000 miles on was great right up until the Power Transfer Unit failed which in turn cause the transmission to catastrophically fail. Jeep is refusing to cover the $13,000 repair bill under warranty. As I was coming to a stop at a rural intersection, I got hung up on a small snow drift. After about 30 minutes of getting in and out of the car while trying all the different 4x4 modes and shoveling, everything exploded. By exploded, I mean I was picking up shrapnel off the ground and transmission fluid was pouring out. This happened while the transmission temp gauge was no higher than 180f. 
      When a person is stuck in the snow, it usually requires spinning the tires a bit, trying to go both forward & reverse, etc. I won't say I was babying the Cherokee, because I wasn't, but I was not revving it up to redline or being overly hard on it. Jeep of course is trying to say it's all my fault but as of this moment, they have not released any specific details to me on exactly how it was my fault or what the criteria is for it being my fault. I do know that after buying a brand new $40,000 Jeep vehicle, I won't ever buy an FCA product again. Don't believe the ""all weather capable"" hype, the photos I have prove that it isn't!",1.0
"This is the third car I own, my first two cars were Honda and now I am currently driving a 2018 Jeep Compass. I have been driving this car since August, on 2/26/19 around 1:30pm I was driving for about 2 minutes when I stopped at a red light and my automatic stop/start turned my car off, I pressed the button and my car started again normally. As the light turned green I moved my foot from the break to the gas and my car did not move. I pressed the auto again and I still did not move, continued to put my car in park and nothing would work. I had to restart my car twice before it would move. This all happened while at a green light with cars behind me.

On 3/1/19 at 2:30pm I did not have auto stop/start on, I was driving for some time and my car started to slow down again so I pushed on the gas to accelerate, it would not accelerate and I was able to pull over to the side when my car came to a stop on its own and the emergency break light came on on its own.

"To Whom It May Concern, I’m writing this letter to voice our frustrations with the Jeep brand, and express our concerns for other owners of the 2013-present day Jeep Cherokee. In July of 2017, my now fiancé purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk 4x4 from Ramsey Motors in Riverside, MO. The vehicle at the time had roughly 24, ** miles, it was a one owner vehicle originally purchased new from Gladstone DCJ & R in 2015.
      On approximately June 18th-19th, the car would not start for my fiancé to make her commute to work. She found a ride, and I had MOPAR roadside assistance tow the vehicle to Stateline CDJ&R of Kansas City for diagnosis. On June 21th, a representative of Stateline called to tell me a PRNDL switch was the root of our issue and quoted me to replace. I protested, believing the issue to be caused by a failing alternator, however being ”highly qualified technicians” I agreed, and Stateline followed through with the service. We picked the car up from Stateline on 6/29/18.The morning on 6/30/18 (yes the next day!) the car failed to start at a gas station in Pittsburg, KS, I instructed my fiancé to take the vehicle to Jay Hatfield DCJ&R in Frontenac, KS. A diagnosis by the service tech that day suggested… a failing alternator! Jay Hatfield apologized for the Stateline’s mistake, quoted me to repair, and promised the car returned to us by the end of the following week.The next few days were spent communicating with and agreeing to a 50% refund of our service fees done by Stateline, we picked the vehicle back up from Jay Hatfield on 7/6/18, I replaced the battery as a precaution the next day. 19 days, 2 dealerships, over $1,500.00 out of pocket, we finally had our vehicle back and felt comfortable with it again. How wrong was I!In early September, the vehicle failed to start on several occasions. Being that Jay Hatfield last had their hands on it, and frankly I found them to be honest and straightforward gentlemen, we made the 100 mile trip back to Jay Hatfield with the vehicle for a 2nd diagnosis. Jay Hatfield kept the vehicle for about 4 days, repeatedly stated to me the vehicle started each time they tried, and returned it to me. I felt like the boy who cried wolf! Are these service departs downright over and done with me? We’re not crazy, the vehicle is malfunctioning, we don’t drive 100 miles for a service appointment for fun & games.We made it through the next 30 days or so without an issue, until the morning of 10/10/18. While leaving a doctor’s appointment and going to work, the car died on my fiancé in traffic. A complete loss of power to the vehicle, no dash lights, no acceleration, nothing. The vehicle was pushed out of traffic, eventually regained power on its own, and driven home where now it sits dead in the driveway. Emergency lights are nice to have when a vehicle is stalled in traffic, my fiancé was not afforded this luxury!This is the final straw, it is clear as day that Chrysler/Jeep builds an inferior product, and maintains inferior means of training technicians to diagnose the very vehicles they sell to the public. The vehicle is nothing more than a $32,000 lawn ornament. Bringing me to the purpose of this letter, as stated above, we are collectively through with CDJ&R vehicles we want nothing to do with this Jeep Cherokee. I am writing with hope that somebody of purpose takes notice, and chooses to take the extra steps to address a customer’s complaint even when their technician is stumped. It is clear there is a deep electrical issue with these vehicles that needs to be investigated. A stalling vehicle in traffic, and subsequently pushing it out of traffic in the rain is a terrifying, extremely unsafe, and completely avoidable situation. I urge you all to take this into consideration when the inevitable “next one” arrives on your doorstep, hopefully that situation turns out better for the customer. If you have any questions, or wish to discuss this topic further, I can be reached via email or on my cell @ **. Thank you for your time.",1.0
"On June 7th of this year, and since then I have had to take the Jeep close to ten times. I purchased this Jeep for a rather affordable price compared to other models at the dealership. I soon found out why. Within 24 hours of owning it, the cooling fan stopped working and caused the engine to overheat within seconds of starting the engine. I took it in to the same dealership I bought it from, a certified Jeep one at that, to be repaired and thought that was it. Exactly two weeks later, the check engine light came back on but this time it was because there was a small evap leak with the emissions system. They repaired it and assured me everything was fine. A week later the light came back on and I was told the fuel tank pressure sensor was faulty. Once again that was taken care of and they said everything was fine. 
      Yet another week went by and the light was back on. The same sensor they replaced the week prior was also faulty. They replaced this and I was hoping everything was finally done having issues. That lasted about two weeks when the light came back on. The dealership said it was being caused by the emissions system, which at this point they had completely replaced the module, but everything was fine. No leaks, no faulty sensors. The light was just on. They cleared it and a week later the light was back on. Only after all this was my Jeep's issues being taken up with Chrysler. I was told that if the light came back on, don't even bother taking it in, just keep driving it like normal. I wasn't having that since the light coming on could have been caused by anything.The final straw was when I was trying to make a left turn in a busy intersection. I pressed on the gas and could hear the engine revving but the car was not moving forward aside from the normal rolling that happens. I took the Jeep in the next morning and they said it had to do with the ABS system needing an update. I almost was in a car accident over an update? That's unacceptable to me. I cannot wait to be rid of this vehicle as I no longer feel safe driving it and I have grown tired of constantly needing to take it in.",1.0
"I'm experiencing stalling, shuddering and shaking. I was told by a Jeep dealer I need an Electronic throttle control body. Of course they whipped out the cost but not the solution. They let me leave with the car like that. The next day I received a lightning bolt warning signal and the car stalled in traffic jerked forward and continued moving slowing in ongoing traffic. This is a safety issue and I advise other owners with these problems to report them.",2.0
"Bought a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee, it was leaking oil and shutting off on the highway. They replaced the whole engine after 24,000 miles, now at 47,000 miles it needs a second engine. Can you imagine to replace 2 engines before it hits 50,000 miles. A complete disaster and failure for the so called JEEP.",1.0
"From the moment I purchased this vehicle I have had nothing but problems, constantly. I bought it new off the lot in 2011 and paid an extra $5k for the warranty. Every few months I have to take it to the dealer for repairs: Twice for exhaust leaks caused by broken exhaust bolts, fuel pump, radiator, water pump, rack and pinion, drive shaft, twice for inside fan blower, left motor mount twice, right motor mount, 8! times and counting for a vibration that cannot be determined, even after an engineer from Chrysler flew out, 2 a/c condensers, spark plug coil, exhaust manifold, rear light cover melted from poor design, air conditioning lines, play in the transmission, oil pan replaced... I mean the list goes on. The kicker is that I have never once even taken this vehicle off road. The bottom is spotless!
      After endless hours on the phone constantly I have yet to receive anyone at Jeep who wants to resolve the issue. The offered me a CDI number for employee pricing, when I went into the dealership to explore the sales guy laughed at me and told me he has way better deals. I would discourage anyone from buying a Jeep ever. All my friends, family, and coworkers have a running joke about me and my Jeep. So sad, especially when Chrysler was bailed out billions of our tax payer money! In addition, I am a disabled service connected veteran of the US Air Force. And this is how I am treated by a company that touts their support of vets! Beyond disappointed.",1.0
"Just hit 22,000 miles on my new 2017 Jeep Willys, only highway driving, less than two years old. The factory installed tires are in need of replacement. If you are planning on buying a one then request that the factory installed tires are replaced with a more reliable tire. A couple donuts from Dunkin' would last longer than the factory installed tires.",1.0
"It's hard to explain it all but in a nutshell -- Jeep doesn't stand behind their product and their customer service is a disservice. In June 2018, my Liberty roof got stuck open. The local dealer was helpful in getting the roof closed but said the part to repair it was back ordered 48 weeks. When the roof started to leak a bit more, I called Jeep/Chrysler to find a solution. OMG. Useless people and baloney answers. The part is in manufacturing. I said, ""Good. How many are you  shipping next week?"" ""IDK"". ""How many Jeeps did you produce with a sky slider roof?"" ""IDK"". ""A case manager will call you back."" Oh that is not my dealership.
      They should be ashamed of themselves to not support a car that is only 8 yrs old and allow the interior to ruined by the rain and not offer a viable solution to protect your investment. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND A JEEP PRODUCT AGAIN and I have had several. Buy a TOYOTA!!! or Hyundai --my second car is GREAT!",1.0
"Particulate filter, catalytic converter, broken grommet, etc. - I am going on day 70 without my Jeep Grand Cherokee. 3 months of payments, no car. 3 months of Sirius radio payments, no car. Have heard the part is on back order for many months-Today called the Chrysler number and he said he sent messages but the service tech hasn't responded. 1st they put a new employee on my case. TWO days on the job. Come on guys. Really? Not fair to him or me. 2nd His response: “I will call the dealer and see if the part is there.” Duh dude-NO it is not there. (Oh wait, they forgot to give it to the tech). Then we had a tremendous exhaust leak into the cabin of my car. Car smoking like crazy. How do I file for Lemon Law?",1.0
"Bought the car in 2003, a year old. I wanted a good road car for work and a Jeep for weekends. This car was and is both. Very little trouble. 160,000 miles on original motor and transmission. A few minor problems but overall a great car. Really a great highway car and also great for camping. If the weather is really bad the dog and I can sleep in the back. I am writing because I see that Land Rover has a line of dog accessories. I rescue old, sick dogs, no one else wants. They are nice dogs and we have a good time. As they get old it gets harder for them to get in the Jeep. I cannot find a ramp that they like. I put cheap AstroTurf in the back and would not mind buying a mat that fit. I guess that is it. Happy customer.",5.0
"The retractable roof broke and will not close completely... Contacted the dealer and was told it would take a month to get the pieces... That month is now going on five... Was given a number by the dealership to call and put in a complaint. Now I have a case number and a woman who calls me every week telling me they are working on rectifying the problem. I was told today that they are unable to make the replacement pieces at this time because the ""mold"" for the piece was lost... So now they are in the process of trying to find a manufacturer to make the ""mold"" to make the piece... then make sure it is safe for the public. REALLY... I call BS. They need to take this car back and return my money. This cannot be legal. 
      I am making car payments on a car I cannot drive safely... Do they not realize God forbid someone drives their car like this and gets into an accident and is ejected from the car and dies because of a faulty roof. Lawsuits up the butt... This is just ridiculous. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER JEEP EVER. This is such bad business on their part... and I will tell anyone who listens to me to never ever buy a Jee. They should be ashamed of themselves.",3.0
"After having a tiny fender bender, or flair bender in this case my car needed to have some minor work done. After waiting a month for parts I decided I was tired of waiting. I was going to be proactive and go above the body shop to see if I could get any help. After contacting several dealers who could not answer the simplest questions about the parts, I decided to call Jeep on my own. I used both the listed contact email and phone number from their website. After being put on intergalactic hold on 1st call, hung up on when I asked to speak to a mgr on the 2nd call, the third call and 3 hours of time actually let me start a case claim. I was told their “excellent “ customer service dept would get back to me within 48 hrs. That’s not excellent when you are having issues that have already taken a month to be addressed. I have to be honest when I say I couldn’t wait the 48 hrs and called back after 24. 
      Again given a scripted runaround statement or “FACTS” as they called it and told that I could keep waiting for my case person to contact me but they were not going to tell me anything different than what she did. Her name was SHAY and she supposedly is the end all be all of customer service at Jeep. She has no boss, no training personnel, or any other contact information to give you. No way to even report the fact that she was extremely belittling. So that’s it! Final answer! Do not pass go do not collect 200 bucks. So in short I have been left in a perpetual waiting period, for some parts out there in the universe. They may come in they may not. And as for as Jeep is concerned I don’t think they care one bit if you were happy with your purchase, happy with their customer service or about you at all. They will NOT stand behind their brand, or give you any assistance once you drive that car off the lot. I’d be happy to speak with anyone at Jeep other than the call center people who I feel were not only unhelpful but downright rude... But I’m not holding my breath.",3.0
"I ordered a Trackhawk when they became available and received it November 29th and was present when it rolled off the truck. It has been everything I expected. It is quick, reliable, very well constructed inside and out. My wife and I took it on a road trip from Kansas City to Seattle area and back and really enjoyed the way it performed and handled. Very easy to drive and use all of the options. It is sure footed in poor road conditions and easy to drive in traffic. This is the ultimate sleeper vehicle. I also own a 15 Viper which is also fun and more than capable of outperforming almost anything on the road and also well put together.",5.0
My 2016 Jeep Renegade shut off while driving home from work at 9:30pm. It was dark and raining. There was no shoulder to even coast too. I could have been injured if I got hit. I am scared to death to drive my Jeep because I’m terrified this will happen again. Turns out there was no oil in Jeep. Why? I ask. I just had an oil change not even 700 miles ago. I’m already down a quart or more so now what?,1.0
My 2006 Jeep Commander is nice and big with 3rd row seat. Great for my big family. Has enough room for everyone to have drinks. I like that my daughter can charge her phone in the 3rd row seat. Leg space for everyone is also good. Overall a very good buy and I am very pleased with it. It has everything I was looking for. If I ever have to buy another car I will be sure to get another Jeep Commander.,5.0
"I just bought the Jeep Liberty a few weeks ago. I like its automatic windows, 4 wheel drive and the back opens up either just the glass or the glass and the door. And the door actually opens up to the side not downward. However, I would change the outer appearance. I wish the body shape wasn't so round and compact. I don't like the super boxy look either but somewhere between this style and the boxy style would be perfect. But other than that, I love this vehicle. It's a 2006 with 141,000 miles on it, runs like a champ and looks like it's brand new practically.",4.0
"Jeep Compass is good on gas. I am glad I picked this type of car. It is reasonably priced for an SUV. It has great stereo and the speakers work well. I like the Bluetooth that came with it. It's nice to be hands free. Moreover, the air conditioning works great. The Compass is great, but I wish it had more leg room and reverse camera. It would be a great safety feature. Also, I'd like it if the front window and side front windows had a bit more tint.",5.0
"With less than 3,000 miles my trans (2018 Jeep Compass Limited 4x4) malfunctioned while on the expressway. I lost all power to the engine. Thankfully I was able to exit safely. Towed for service to the dealership. Valve body harness replaced and said it was good to go. Driving home from the dealership it wasn't shifting correctly and eventually had no gears at all and need to be towed back the next day. My car got a new transmission. The next problem was the front windows wouldn't roll down. Back for service, a corroded module inside the door was the problem. No explanation as to how or why this happened other than it must of been installed that way. 
      Picked up car the next day and while driving home my HVAC would not switch modes, and the navigation system came up without prompting, returned within 10 minutes from pick up and back in for service. It's been in the repair shop 4x in less than a month and currently in for a week today with latest electrical issue. Thankfully my service department is backing me when I say this car needs to be taken back and I'm currently working with my dealership to make this happen. I have zero confidence in its dependability and am afraid to drive it.",1.0
"I've always owned cars and I love SUVs. This Jeep Liberty has good gas mileage but had horrible suspension. Engine had to be replaced ball joints twice and locks keep malfunctioning. It does go good in the winter and four wheel drive is tricky but when you get it it works good. Price and the body style was also nice. It is roomy, convenient and I like the color, too. But a CD player, better engines and a better suspension would be nice. And fix the four wheel drive as well.",2.0
"I've had an overall decent experience. I don't love the Jeep but it's reliable enough. The Jeep's design and features are very appealing. It has heated seats, a sunroof, a lot of extras, and it's nice to look at. There are also chrome rims. It connects my phone through the radio too. It's durable but I bought it certified from the dealer and as soon as the warranty expired I feel like I keep having to replace parts. I've had a lot of little mechanical issues go wrong as well. Also, when my teenagers sit in the back there isn't much leg room and I can't seem to have enough space to bring things. Our leather seats also get cold in the winter, and have some tiny tears now.",3.0
"Jeep has always been a reliable brand and I love my Renegade. The interior is super roomy and very comfortable. This model also includes a fair amount of cargo space. The only features missing from this particular model are no hatchback and its lack of a cargo hitch. It'd be quite useful to be able to haul a small trailer if need be, as we have motorcycles that sometimes need hauled. But other than that, the safety features are great. As a parent, it makes me much more confident knowing my daughter is the safest she can be. The Jeep Renegade drives very smooth and it's a comfort to know that when the weather turns snowy, that 4-wheel drive can save you.",5.0
"I was very disappointed cause my Jeep needs a new engine. It has a blown head gasket after 3 months of me owning it and the seller cut the 4 wheel drive shaft out. I wish I could have brought it to a garage to have it looked over cause then I would have had the opportunity to say no or gotten it cheaper or had the seller fix it. He just plainly ripped me off for like 2000. It's just not worth putting that kind of money in it. I also didn't like the center console. It has the window controls there instead of by the window like on the door panel. Even so, I liked the fact that it was an SUV but wasn't huge. It had plenty of space and seemed to have run great. Was also pretty easy to work on and maintain but I didn't really get to drive it all that much.",1.0
"I have great experience with my Jeep Compass. Good on gas, handles well in bad weather, it is a four cylinder engine, and comfortable. Get good gas mileage and parts are fairly affordable, too. It has heated seats, also has four wheel drive, very roomy for size of vehicle, has built in CD player and design is with customer comfort in mind, overall appearance of the vehicle catches the eye and it has a smaller engine which is fuel economy but has the power to get thru anything. However, the Jeep should have a bigger trunk or storage area or should come with a compartment on top of rack for better storage of road side equipment and car maintenance.",4.0
I purchased a 2017 Jeep Renegade in April 2018. The car died on me and shut itself down while in motion 3 times. The car was diagnosed with a fuel pump issue. I have now been without my vehicle for 3 weeks and the part will not be released for at least another 3. Jeep will not provide me with a loaner or rental until my vehicle is repaired and if I pay for one myself I won't be reimbursed. So basically buying a Jeep with a manufacturer defect is just my bad luck. Customer service at Jeep has been condescending and frustrating. I will never again buy a Jeep and will inform everyone of my problems with the car and the company.,1.0
"I love my Jeep Renegade but I wish it had more features. The dealer did not know anything about the Jeep and was very misleading. I was upset once I signed the paperwork. I should've test drive it as well. Don't have Uconnect and the dealer led me to believe I would. I also would improve the price. I still think I was paying for the name Jeep and overpaid on the car. Nevertheless, having a Remote start is by far the best. I Love starting it 10 mins before I leave in the morning remotely. I also love power windows and having tire pressure gauges.",4.0
"This is the first Jeep product I have owned and so far, I am really happy with my purchase. The Jeep dealership was super. Great service and friendly staff. I can see all of my future vehicle purchases being Jeep products also. My only problem I have encountered is that my kids are way too close to me and each other. I'm used to a minivan and the distance between us makes long drive a more bearable. Lol. But other than that, I like that the Jeep Renegade is at a very fair price. I also like the touchscreen stereo, which is standard in most vehicles these days but still appealing to me.",5.0
"My Jeep Patriot is good and reliable. I drive easily to work every day, over 50 miles, and get around on my rural gravel roads, which can get really wet or slick in the winter and spring, and don't always get plowed quickly. Plus they are hilly, so I need 4 wheel drive often after bad weather. The engine is good, but not very powerful. I would like to feel a bit more power when I press the gas pedal. I also got bigger tires for my jeep, as the original tires were kind of small, and I wanted more powerful looking tires. Other than that, I like that it's an SUV, a 4 wheel drive, has lots of room in hatch, leather seats and is comfortable. I really wanted a Jeep, as I had a Jeep in the past that I loved, with the classic Jeep look.",5.0
"I love my Jeep Patriot. It is extremely reliable, and in wonderful condition. Since my car is front wheel drive, it is common for my front tires to skid in the rain if going at a fast speed. I love the color of my vehicle, and the shape of it. The trunk of my car is very spacious, I am able to fit a lot of things back there. Also, the back seat of my car is spacious. I enjoy having cloth seats because it is hot where I live, and leather seats would burn me. The only complaint I have in regards to my vehicle would be concerning the middle seat in the back row. It is uncomfortable to sit in that seat because there is not much space to put your legs. Sometimes I wish the car was a little more technologically updated, but other times I love the simplicity of my car. Less technology, less problems.",5.0
The Jeep Compass has proved to be good. I have not had any issues with the make or model of the car. The crossover style is good for my current lifestyle and needs. The seats fold in to create extra space for moving or transporting large items. It also allows me to have space and to feel safer on the road because of the size. I dislike the radio that it came with initially. However a new one could be installed easily enough with the proper tools. I also dislike the handles on the backseat doors as they are a little hard to open.,4.0
The Jeep Patriot is by far one of the best vehicles we have owned. It gets great gas mileage and does awesome in snow. This past Christmas my family went to visit family in Jamestown NY and ran into blizzard like conditions and if it wasn't for the 4 wheel drive I don't know what we would have done. The Patriot had no problems getting us through the snow storm. We like the 4 wheel drive. It gets up and goes with no problems. There's plenty of room for the family and groceries. We like all the other features as well. But we find it hard to look both ways when there's a passenger or you're by yourself and it's hard to see down the road cause of the door frame. Other than that we don't have any complaints. My family loves the Patriot and was sad to hear that they are stop making them.,5.0
"My Jeep Liberty has been a safe, reliable vehicle that has required only routine maintenance. It's got a great capacity in the rear for its size. Convenient when I've bought small furniture items. I also like the four-wheel drive. We could tow this car behind our RV, and it would support the lift for my husband's mobility scooter without dragging. However, the seats could be more comfortable.",4.0
"I have had my 2013 Jeep Patriot for almost 5 years now. I like this car because it gets good gas mileage, it has a satellite radio, heated seats, heated mirrors and radio controls on the steering wheel. Also it has a sunroof that I enjoy a lot. I like almost everything about my Jeep Patriot. The only thing I dislike a little is that it is a bit hard to tell how close you are getting to objects. But other than that, it has been a very reliable vehicle and all I have had to do is have it serviced.",4.0
"Check engine light is a problem and after going to the dealership and paying 500+ to fix the problem, it still came on. I like the car overall but the remote start feature is deactivated when check engine light is on. The radio also doesn't have CD player and only plays sat radio or iPod/phone. The gas mileage isn't that great and could be better. Also, most of the repairs are very costly. Nevertheless, I like the look and color of the vehicle. It has heated seats and remote start which was what I was looking for in a vehicle. The sunroof is an added benefit as well.",3.0

I wanted it reported as I see that this is affecting many many owners of this vehicle with the same issue but no recall has ever been issued.

"When I bought this car, nobody told me if I don’t regularly drive long distance on the freeway the soot level will build up and the car breaks down and needs to be towed in for service. My commute is only 5 minutes so I don’t have any need to drive long distances over 60 mph as the car required. I have had it break down three times since 2015. Jeep is very clever at dodging my calls and I can’t get anywhere with them. They have about the worst customer service I’ve ever seen.

I have a 2011 Jeep Liberty Limited. I change oil and everything as required. I noticed it having a little tick in 2015 and took it dealership but it wouldn’t do it on the test drive. Then again in 2016 and they said it was AC kicking in. Well it was a sign of a major problem. It wanted stalled out on me after an hour and in cold weather and then at 140k miles and cold weather engine would not go over 30 mph. Had coil and sensors and plugs change out still didn’t want to get good mileage of take off. Then it started smoking and it was a gasket at 150500 miles. As good as I am with this engine it cost $4000 to put new gasket and catalytic converter on it. Never buy a Jeep again! The engine still wants to die on me but too upside down to trade it in now.,1.0

"I bought a Jeep in October (2017), not from this location but this is where I brought my car in for repairs. FIRST I NEED TO SAY WARRANTY ISN'T COVERING A WARRANTABLE FIX - let me tell you a bit first... I was leaving for work last Saturday, 3/3/18, and my CV axle/ball joint malfunctioned. I bought my 2015 Jeep Renegade from Centennial location called Prestige Jeep... location (where I will leave a review next) and it was pre-owned. I don't know if this malfunction is due to the vehicle's prior use (clean Carfax though) or due to a bad joint. There were plenty of other Jeep recalls on front drive axles since 2015. Anyhow, I have drive to and from all of my patients' homes, (full-time nurse) and to and from UNLV (full-time student at 18 units!!!!!) and twice to the grocery store and gas each month. 
      That's where I have drive. This is a 2015 Renegade with 14,675 miles on it and the axle/ball joint is malfunctioning and the vehicle is undrivable. I bought extended warranty but don't waste your time and money doing that because not even the Jeep original warranty (5 years/60k miles) won't cover it. Lol and they had the NERVE at the SAHARA location to call me while my vehicle is sitting in their lot unfixed and ask me if I'm interested in purchasing another Jeep LOL!!! UM ** NO.

I found out today I bought a 2010 Jeep liberty in 2013 had 19000 miles on it. Never was told it had a recall for leaking water pump. Well I have had it for 7 years. I have 35500 miles on it. Now the water pump is shot again. 2 water pumps in less than 8 years. Seems Jeep has a problem that needs to be addressed. I have no problem fixing what goes wrong but I do have a problem with the same thing having to be fixed in a short period of time. And under 50000 miles pretty pathetic. I would never buy another Jeep of any kind. It should still be under some kind of manufacture warranty under 50000 miles. And if there is a problem in this part then Jeep should be responsible in replacing it. Faulty and cheap.,1.0
Worst buying experience I have ever had. Purchased a new 2017 Jeep Wrangler in April 2017 and it had been in the shop for the same problem. Jeep customer service keep promising they would take care of the matter. To call them when I was at the service department. I did and all I did was waste my time. They did nothing. I was awarded a buyback/repurchase lemon law. Customer service has been no help to me either and 2 months later I'm still awaiting for this to be settled.

"My wife and daughter visiting New Mexico. On way home in 2015 Jeep Renegade on the August 25th had check engine light come on and had to tow vehicle to mechanic who look at vehicle reset light and said all looked fine. Next day just outside Colorado Springs engine light came back on, had vehicle towed again to Faricy Boys dealership, which inspected vehicle and found cooling fan relay bad and would have to order part. Now after weekend Monday was assured would have part by Wed. the 30th at which time was told no part is coming and did not know when part would arrive. Now 5 days later speaking with parts department manager telling me I did not give them enough time to locate part and offered no solution but to wait another 2 days.
      Now my wife's father was being admitted to hospital for heart issues and my daughter starting college that week. With no choice now and could not afford to keep them in Colorado costing already $1200 without food expenses fly them back home to Michigan $850. Now after hours of being on phone with, ""I'm sorry"" and promises a case manager would contact me which during the whole time even the 60 day case review did someone contact me. The people at Faricy Boys felt really bad and after waiting 2 WEEKS TO GET A PART TO FINALLY FIX VEHICLE, Faricy Boys felt bad and tried to get someone from FCA do the right thing and arrange for shipment of vehicle home.Being on Social Security Disability for terminal illness stage 4 cancer this is really wearing on me. Emotionally stressed out and financially draining. Now again wasting time on the phone told me, ""Sorry again. We will have case manager call you back"" which never did. Now I had to pay another $700 to ship vehicle home. Now I was given a number to the office of the president at FCA who was going to supposedly be able to help me recoup some expenses but once again was let down. They have quite the setup with customer service. You will never be able to really speak to anyone of importance. Now after waiting their 60 days for case review they tell me when I called again they did not receive my receipts which I spent another $60 at UPS store emailing and faxing.After resending and calling to make sure they received them which they confirmed they did tried to do the same thing and tell me they did not have them. But during the phone call which like them for quality purposes recorded told her, ""You sure you do not have them because the other women I spoke to said they were in my case file."" Now it was, ""Oh ya. Here they are. I'm sorry. I will again have your case manager call you after review,"" which I told her the 60 days was up. One of the last times I called they had the wrong case number this time then continued to tell me the only receipt she had was one from AutoZone for $86. Enough is enough at this point I was like and this women sympathetic sorry sorry. I would be happy to just get reimbursed for $850 airfare and $700 shipping.After all this I have yet to receive one phone call from FCA to do the right thing. I have been a loyal customer for more than 20 years and currently lease 2 vehicles but they are the last. This 2 dollar part which they did not have is all because this Jeep is made in Italy. They had to take it off assembly line. What a joke. No parts for a vehicle they have been making for several years, and the big thing was always, ""I'm sorry. This part is on back order. You have to wait your turn."" This whole time I tried to get a loaner car. They would not even do that for me. Had to cancel plans going anywhere for holiday weekend, would not even help with loaner. Shame on you FCA. Shame poor customer service. I was hung up on, lied to. Poor way of doing business.",1.0
New car under 2000 miles returned to the dealer 4x + for the same issue. Dealer cannot fix and Jeep is not standing behind their product. Talked to a rude sr. escalation manager Patricia at Jeep with the resolution team (**) who told me she cannot help any further and is the highest level of support at the Jeep brand. Dealer stated there is nothing more they can do and reached out to Jeep for help. Getting the runaround by Jeep corp and would never buy another Jeep product again. Will pursue local lemon law and NCDS replacement claim. Truly unfortunate that Jeep does not care about their customers or products. Really hard to recommend Jeep to others and suggest they learn how to treat customers and fix their major quality issues.,1.0
"I bought a Jeep a year ago but it has been the worst investment that the seller made a car with factory problems, the roof with problems of liquefaction. I go four times that they try to fix but always has a different problem. The mechanics have been deteriorating. They put old screws to repair it, they do not put their original parts, to each place that I wear they put a different silicone in it, I lost my love for my car. The truth is that my car has the guarantee but they do not want it answer for my car, if they already realized that the car is not only repaired with silicone and patches. It is best to change the whole piece but Jeep has not returned the call. I think they are waiting for the warranty to end so that dissatisfied customers can not claiming for our rights. It's sad because I thought it was a good company.",1.0
"My daughter was driving her 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee along with moderate traffic in the left lane of a main road at a speed of 30 mph in a 25 mph area. It was dry with a temperature of about 60 degrees. When the light turned red at an intersection, my daughter applied the brakes to stop, but the car didn't stop. She resorted to slamming on the brakes 2 times and by the 3rd time she slammed the brakes her car crashed full force into the car in front of her pushing the car into the center turning lane. My daughter's car then crashed into the next vehicle which was a box truck. Her airbags did not deploy. My daughter was trapped in her car, but did find a way to get out. 
      I made arrangements for an inspector from Chrysler to go to the body shop to inspect the car to see what may have caused the brakes to malfunction and the airbags to not deploy. Within a few days of the inspection we received a letter from a Mr. ** from Chrysler. The letter was dated the day after the inspection stating that it wasn't a manufacturing responsibility and that all parts operated as designed. Something caused the brakes and airbags to malfunction even though Chrysler won't admit to it. If my daughter would have been going at a higher speed on the freeway, she would have been killed. Chrysler is not returning my phone calls, emails or my certified letter.",1.0
"I've about had it with this 2006 Jeep Commander nonstop issues and it's never ending money pit. Sunroof leaks, gotten it fixed multiple times. Stalls switching from reverse to drive. Repaired that and it still does it. The right side power steering went, new rack and pin. Massive massive electrical issues, you fix one problem leads to another. The electrical issues don't stop!!! Since it takes hours and hours for the mechanic to pinpoint one electrical problem and that's just to give a quote. Then the car has shut off while turning and other vehicle coming at me, that ignition switch recall supposedly fixed that.
      My mechanic said stop putting money into this. He said the engine is going to go soon. I don't have money to just purchase another vehicle!! We have 4 kids.

"I bought a 2016 Jeep Patriot a year ago this month. Since the day we drove it off of the lot the XM Satellite Radio has not worked properly. It loses the signal every 1/2 mile or so and fades in and out constantly while driving, and it doesn't matter if we're in town or out in the middle of nowhere. I have complained and had it in the shop repeatedly for this problem and all I ever get is lied to and called a liar because they can't duplicate the problem, even though I've shown them no less than four videos of the radio losing its signal. My wife finally took the service manager at our dealership on a ride-along and proved to him that the radio is a piece of junk, to which he agreed. Corporate still WILL NOT REPLACE THE RADIO with one that actually WORKS.
      Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram SUCKS! I have own three brand new Hyundais, all with XM, and NOT ONE SINGLE PROBLEM, EVER! We have a so-called Case Manager from Uconnect who is about as worthless as ** on a boar hog. He whines that he's not authorized to have the radio replaced. Then why has he been wasting my time, dragging me down to the dealership time and again only to be told Im a liar and they cant help me. I may have an arbitration agreement that I was forced to sign, but it only precludes class-action suits. Im getting my own lawyer and I am going to sue Jeep under Nevadas Lemon Law. And its going to cost them a whole lot more than a radio by the time its over. Also, I will NEVER buy another Jeep, or anything else this fly-by-night outfit makes.

"The vehicle (2014 Jeep Latitude) is not worth the money. I drove it off the lot and immediately had issues with the transmission shifting hard. Took it back. They said it was because it was new. 16,000 miles later had to put a new transmission in. Today took it in because it's still shifting hard and was told ""All the motor mounts are bad and need replacing. We are still working on trying to do the updates to the computer for the transmission. We will let you know."" Never again will I buy a Jeep!! Nothing but issues with the transmission and other stuff. Oh yea I have taken it in many times on the AC not working. You will be driving and all of a sudden it will start heating. They still haven't fixed that issue. Nothing but junk and oh yea the power train doesn't cover the motor mounts. That's 1300.00 that I have to pay outta pocket.

"2017 Jeep (4 Cyl) - Rented one from Enterprise while on vacation and drove it about 200 mi over three days in San Fran and Napa. Flat out not bad but has so little power on hills (drive back roads of Napa/Sonoma that it had less power than the K cars of the 80's which had 110 HP engines). I mean on steep hills, floored you couldn't get more than 25 MPH. Door locks did not work so had to press them down by hand and car had overall cheap feel to it.

"I bought my first 2014 Jeep Overland and within 3 years my Jeep would just die while driving. Took the vehicle in and they could never figure out what was wrong. I drove it for a couple more months and the same thing would happen that I eventually was so scared to drive my vehicle, more so with my grandkids in the car that I decided to trade it in for another Jeep. I really like the look and feel of the Jeep that I just thought I had a lemon and would buy a new one. 
      So I buy a brand new 2017 Jeep Summit. Has 2000 miles on it and now this one starts to shift gears when it is coasting or coming to a complete stop. I now have been told I need a new transmission in my Jeep. Just so frustrating and really sad that I now have gone through 2 brand new vehicles with Jeep!

"I bought a 2017 Jeep Rubicon 2 months ago. It has 3000 miles on it. We were driving along a driveway @ 15mph 2 days ago and the back window of the Jeep EXPLODED shattering into hundreds of pieces (as it's designed to do). We checked around the vehicle and could find nothing that would have caused it to shatter. We are traveling in CO, so took it to the nearest Jeep dealer who, indicated to my husband that they could not even LOOK @ it for another MONTH. They then referred us to the local auto glass company for repair. 
      When we asked about warranty, the dealer said it would be our insurance - not warranty. When I outreached to Jeep/Wave, they indicated that, without a jeep dealer's ""diagnosis"" they could not provide warranty coverage so we would have to use our insurance to repair it. They also indicated that they could not ""force"" their DEALER to perform the diagnosis in a more timely fashion. All this leaving us to pay out of pocket for the replacement OR drive around CO for the next month waiting for the dealer to find the time to diagnose our window. Shoddy warranty coverage Jeep. Shame on you!",1.0
"I have always been a Jeep fan, from the time of childhood. I loved everything about them, the look, the engine, the fact that they were American made, and the impression that they took care of their customers. Sadly something as little as an auxiliary cord insert has changed all that. After my auxiliary cord started to malfunction I took the car into the jeep dealership to get it looked at. They sprung their diagnosis fee at me last minute which so happened to be $100 dollars, to look at the radio. They came back to tell me conveniently that this issue couldn't be fixed and that I would need an entire new radio which would be extra, of course. Knowing exactly what happened to the auxiliary cord, I questioned their diagnosis.
      So I contacted the company directly, which apparently means to them that I didn't understand what was being told to me at the dealership, so they clarified all the information, (basically a waste of time with ID member **), who also failed to answer my other question of who is supervisor was and how to contact them. What makes matters worse is that I was informed in the waiting room by a fellow customer, how to fix the problem for only $50. I had already agreed to the diagnosis fee, assuming the Jeep Company had their customer's interests at heart. Instead I felt like it was another situation of a big company taking advantage of the little guys, for a small price.After seeing their reviews, it doesn't surprise me that their customer service rate is so low. It seems as though Jeep is trying to fix that the wrong way. All of the employees were very nice telling me they were unable to fix the problem, but that's not what customer service is about. It's not about being nice. It's about having your customers best interest at heart and that is NOT a Jeep thing.Further information, I have had the car 2 years and as great as it has treated me, it's not a car I would recommend. I got into a minor fender bender a couple of months back where I hit another car going 10 mph. There was no visible damage to either cars, so we just exchanged information and went our separate ways. The Next day my check engine light went on and my car started to act funky, so I took it into Midas. They told me that it looked like my car hit a metal pole, with all the damage that was created, $900 of internal damages after a hit going 15 mph.Another issue I've had with the car was its roaders. My aunt drove my car over a parking curb. That one bump created an additional $800 bill because the roaders are not make to support that type of maneuver. (Rolling OVER a CURB.) Jeeps get a fake rap for being tough. That is not the case with the patriot. I am done with Jeeps based on their priorities alone.

"So I've been reading that this is a problem with the 2014 Jeep Cherokee and even the dealer admits it and can do nothing for me. I've had the Jeep go bone dry and shut down after 5k miles on multiple occasions prior to realizing this was an ongoing issue. This time I had the oil changed 3200 miles ago and the engine seized this morning. If this happened on the highway I could see it resulting in injury or death. The manufacturer does nothing, the dealer (Lester Glenn Jeep, Toms River, NJ) does nothing. I'm told for them to do anything it has to meet lower than whatever the standard were for a vehicle to burn which was something like a quart per 1k miles. I've had 10-20 yr old vehicles that didn't burn oil like that. This isn't normal. This time around it did burn quicker than the allotted quart/mi and I imagine it's not going to be improving.

"My experience with buying and owning a Jeep Patriot. I bought a Jeep Patriot Sport with a manual transmission in 2011. Bought it new (zero miles). I now have only 33000 miles on the vehicle. It has never been off-road and has never pulled or towed anything. Recently, I noticed a noise coming from the powertrain. Took it to a mechanic who advised me that I probably needed a clutch replacement (clutch, throw-out bearing and pressure plate). I contacted Chrysler/Jeep about the situation and asked if they would cover the repairs on the powertrain. Their response was as in this e-mail response: 
      ""Thank you for contacting the Jeep Customer Assistance Center. It is understandable that you would like to know if you have warranty coverage prior to getting your vehicle repaired at an independent repair facility. As per your warranty booklet, manual transmission clutch parts are not covered at any time and the pressure plate throw out bearing was only covered for 1 year and 12000 miles so there would be no factory warranty coverage for these repairs. I also want to let you know that the Powertrain warranty expired on September 30, 2016. While looking into this matter for you, I also see that you have 1 incomplete recall. The S61- OCCUPANT RESTRAINT CONTROLLER recall does not yet have parts available but the parts are expected to become available in June. Once the parts become available you can get that repair completed by scheduling an appointment at your local dealership. ""I would like to add you to the special tracking so that you receive an email when those parts become available. You also have an extended warranty for your (X69) FRONT/REAR CROSSMEMBERS. You are able to have a free annual inspection for the Cross Members and if they are deemed to be corroded any time prior to September 30, 2021, they will be replaced free of charge as well. Thank you again for your email. Should you require additional assistance, or have any new information to provide, please reply to this email message or call 1-877-I-AM-JEEP (1-877-426-5337).""In 2011, when I purchased this vehicle (new) I had every expectation that it would last a long time. I have kept up on the maintenance and, as evidenced by the low mileage, I have driven it reasonably. I certainly did not expect that there would be two safety recalls, (one of which they cannot correct because they don't have the parts to resolve the issue). I certainly did not expect that there would be a potentially serious issue with corrosion of FRONT/REAR CROSSMEMBERS, to the extent that Jeep extended the warranty on these parts only. And I certainly did not expect that the powertrain would go out on me so soon, at only 33000 miles.In retrospect, upon examining the warranty information more closely, it seems that there must be a reason Chrysler/Jeep offers such an inadequate warranty on their product. Could it be that they know they are selling an inferior product that would probably fail in a relatively short time? One can only guess. I must conclude, from my experience, that Chrysler/Jeep has produced and sold an inferior product (as described above) and that further, they appear to be unwilling to back up their product with an adequate warranty plan. It is my intention to NEVER purchase another of their products. Furthermore, I cannot, in good conscience (based upon this experience) recommend that anyone else purchase any of their products. Since it is evident that Chrysler/Jeep is not going to do anything to resolve the situation, I guess that I am left without recourse. Lesson learned. Don't buy a Jeep. Caveat emptor.",1.0
"I bought a Renegade 2015 and allegedly sold me a warranty against MECHANICAL MISTAKES; I signed a paper that says ""INSURANCE OF MECHANICAL FAILURES""; It turned out to be a guayazos insurance and wash the seats if they are stained.

"I bought my 2016 Jeep Renegade new. I have had it since March of 2016. I am VERY dissatisfied with it and the Jeep experience. I started having problems with it around July of last year and it has literally been in and out of the shop since. I lose gas power while driving, it just does not go. Jeep's reasoning behind no gas is ""the transmission is trying to find a gear."" This is NOT acceptable. A car should go no matter what when you push the gas pedal down. 
      I have had a few close calls because my car chooses when it wants to go. I have also been told ""turn your traction control off and this should fix the problem."" I am not sure why this should fix my problem, my car should go when I push the gas down. I asked why I have to manually put my car in first gear, their response is ""First gear is for four wheel drive."" Well, there is your problem. That's why it ""can't find a gear"" when I am rolling forward, or turning and trying to go. Maybe it needs first gear. This is the WORST car I have EVER driven. I love how the excuses of why it drives so horribly just flow like a river. I should feel safe when I drive my car, and I don't because I don't know when it is going to happen. The problem has happened to my husband and my son.",1.0
"Lemon Law help with 2016 Jeep Latitude 3.0 FWD: I bought a new Jeep from Nyle Maxwell Chrysler Dodge in Austin, Texas. From the get go, they allowed each bank to pull a hard pull credit instead of pulling one and telling banks it was a soft pull. This tanked my credit, but I digress. From the start, the wipers failed during a storm. They came loose and grabbed the other wiper and I couldn't see past 100 yards on a one lane toll! Only by the grace of God did I not crash. I found the closest Dealership and called, but service didn't care that I was traveling through Houston. They told me to leave it overnight.
      I tried Rivercity location and the service manager saved the day when another service guy laughed at me when I told him I nearly could have crashed. Betty, the Service manager told me to come right in. The rain was less violent by then. Because it was a new version of Jeep, they had no parts and took the wipers off a new vehicle. A month or so later, there was a recall on wipers, which my Dealer handled when I took my Jeep in for a cruise control problem. The cruise control would not maintain a 2-3 mile range after going down even a low grade hill. It would go up to 12 miles more, and then attempt to slow, but it wasn't a smooth transition. It was Jerky, but not dramatic, but unacceptable.They updated the computer, installed new wipers and told me that maybe the cruise control would fix by update... but it did not. I would add that I was given a rental car, but find it unacceptable that you make an appointment, and they can't look at it for 4-5 days! There seems to always be recall backlogs! The second time I took it in, I allowed a guy in service to ""test drive"" it home and back. My advisor drove it, too, but because no ""codes"" came out on computer, they couldn't do anything. Both also said that the cruise worked fine... so, I go pick it up and bam! It still does the same thing going on a hilly area in San Antonio, but not huge hills, just low to medium grade hills.As a side note, I use my car to earn money, and each time they ""test"" it and give me a rental, I am without any way of making bank! My first oil change was a normal one, averaging 21 mph, but since then, I use full synthetic and it went to 24 mph. I came to work in Austin, and the auto stop and on feature stopped working. This affected the RPM, which now never goes down to zero anymore. I've burned through a tank of gas after only 150 miles, getting 19 mph! Of course this was on a Friday afternoon, too. So, I can't earn what I need, defeating the purpose of coming to Austin, and next week SXSW travelers begin to arrive. I CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS IT, YET CANNOT AFFORD TO DRIVE THIS LEMON!The other issue is when the auto stop feature was off and I would go down a steep hill, the brakes would come on and slow me down! This sounds like a transmission problem, too! Is Chrysler waiting for the warranty to expire? I've got nearly 25,000 miles now and need help to get rid of this lemon. There is a lemon law, right?

"Check Engine Light/Software Updates - To begin with I am glad that you are reading this, on the other hand I am sad. Simply because you would not reading this unless you have had problems with your vehicle. I bought a new 2015 Jeep Renegade Trailblazer, bad mistake. This is the fifth Jeep I have owned and let me quite frank about it, it is a piece of garbage. If I had known the thing had been made in Italy I would not have bought it, much less traded my 2010 Jeep Liberty for it. At this date it has less than 20,000 miles on it and I have the records to show that it has had over 20 software updates done to it. Lemon law, right, the only thing that is yellow here is the Jeep representative that will not return my calls, and at this point the service manager at the dealership will not return my calls either. They know the vehicle is a piece of (well you know what).
      Right, I am pissed, but who cares out there? I am writing this just to blow some steam off. Vacation time comes around and I'm afraid to go anywhere far in it. That's sad, new vehicle and no trip anywhere. Now, let me say this. I have found out the motor of this thing was designed by the same man who designed Maserati's, (or so I have been told), well he might know fast motors, but he dang sure is not an electronics guy. Really, JEEP should take pride in the fact that they used to be made in America and that they have served in many wars and stand up for the American people that bought their products. By doing so, Mr. JEEP guys, just take this piece of heap that you call a vehicle and stick it. Just pay off the remainder of my note.

"No wonder used Jeeps are being sold just under the warranty expiration for such a cheap price! GOOGLE any used Jeep and you'll think you're getting a deal. Bought this vehicle from Duluth Dodge Chrysler, it was a 2014 used with 29,000 on it. It seemed to start to have odometer issues and so the odometer was replaced under warranty. It would reset miles traveled so I couldn't get exact mileage on it. I hadn't problems with it until it hit 87,000 miles, and suddenly an obscure diagnosis from the dealership, considering, Jeep and most Chrysler products have had this problem for years. First the ETC (throttle control light flashed) while traveling 30 mph uphill and then car sputtered and almost stalled out. Situation didn't happen again for another week, just after having new brakes, and rotors on the rear. The brakes didn't wear evenly either, but not much of a concern over that at the moment, considering the car is now undrivable.
      While leaving a parking garage, the attendant left the vehicle run, and when I got inside, the ETC, the Engine Light, and ESC lights stayed on. Car, stalled, I followed directions by shutting car off according to the owner's manual (which is a dead giveaway Chrysler has seen this issue before) -- however, I had to inch my way home with several stops, stalls, and at one point the car jumped while I had my foot on the brake at a stoplight nearly hitting a pedestrian, because it idled so high, the entire instrument panel lit up like a Xmas tree. It just went to the dealership which I could only afford a one hour scan $220 bucks to have them say it must be an electrical issue and they had all kinds of codes come up.I mentioned to them that this issue is fairly common with Jeeps but again, they are covering their ears and perhaps it's a problem they cannot fix because they have no idea how to repair it. They called and said, they'd like to see if they can save me money and perform some type of pigging back wire connection to the throttle. They said it was the throttle that wasn't getting enough juice, but there must be a short somewhere, but it could get expensive trying to find it, so here was their short-cut alternative.I've read other posts here about the wires shorting out because they're too close to the camshaft or catalytic converter... I wouldn't know -- but I do know that Chrysler has been STALLING ON A RECALL for this problem for years.

"Purchased 2014 (new) Jeep Patriot from Nielsen Jeep/Dodge in East Hanover NJ Route 10. Computer on vehicle failed twice costing us hundreds in rental car fees as well as the inconvenience. The dealer does not cover the rental car and each time we drop the car off we have to wait almost a week before they will even look at it. We are also forced to pay an initial fee to determine that it is in fact a warranty issue. The computer is covered, but not the initial evaluation fee or the rental cars. I would think Nielsen/Chrysler would stand behind their product. We now have a car that is unreliable and we don't know where to turn. Is the computer going to fail again and strand us on a dark road in the middle of nowhere?",1.0
The worst vehicle that I have ever own. No... the worst investment that I have ever made. This vehicle has given me nothing but issues. I think that I may stop parking it in the garage and just park it at the mechanic every night. At 30000 the thermostat failed; at 50000 miles the water pump failed; soon after the head gasket blew; then the head itself; then the water pump again; the heat; the alarm would go off when driving; had two batteries die due to a draw somewhere; the camshaft had to be replaced; the cam sensor; oh... let's not forget the oil sender sensor and now back in the shop because it randomly stalls at speeds over 40 miles an hour. I feel like I am driving a Yugo.,1.0
"I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty w/ 3.7L/V6 engine. The main issues is the RADIATOR made of combined plastic and aluminum components. I had my faulty radiator replaced 5 times since I bought it due to horrible leaking! This design flaw of PLASTIC components, COMBINED with the leaking the radiator ALWAYS RESULTS to ENGINE DAMAGE DUE TO 1) valve gasket busted, 2) coolant mixing into the ignition chamber or within the cylinders, 3) Valve seat problems... ALL causing CYLINDER MISFIRES. The downside... is VERY, VERY expensive as in the thousands of dollars! Radiator's hose are also troublesome. There are many issues with Jeep's product and 3.7L engine design, that many in the World wide web consider it a JUNK (SCIENCE). Wondering, they have discontinued the LIBERTY design?
      What I have observed is the MIXED plastic components also found in its interiors, electronic issues, fan clutch issues, power steering noise issue including rack & pinions, hoses and belts and become easily TOO ""rotten"", I have been upkeep with maintenance: Synthetic engine oil, transmission fluid exchange, Coolant exchange, Rear diff exchange, Air filters, BELTs and tensioner, etc. BUT still it boils down to the Radiator plus minus ENGINE cooling components. FEEL the HEAAATTTTT! LESSON I've learned. STAY AWAY from a JEEP PRODUCT!",2.0
"I had rented a Jeep compass 12/09/16 and that day I had a roll over accident. I drive professionally and that day I drove at a safe speed for the road conditions. Speed at about fifteen to twenty mph before applying the brake. It had snowed and there was ice conditions. I attempted to stop at a stop sign on a paved road base when the car began to shut down (clicking noises) but the car seemed to pick up momentum. As the car ran through the stop area. The road changed from paved base to a dirt road base. I continued to apply the brake. 
      As the car came upon the dirt road I was hoping the dirt road would provide grab but the momentum continued. The car slid from about twenty feet when applying the brake before the stop sign plus across about a twenty-foot dirt road base slipping for a total of about forty feet. As I viewed the ditch (luckily no water in it) I was headed for, with a ten foot drop, I thought I did all that I could and prepared for the hurt that I and the car will have. And now, two days later, I use the term ""terminator"". I felt the car had its on will. Applying the brake did nothing. I hope this vehicle is recalled because I could of easily not have been viable now.",1.0
The transmission on my 2015 has been recalled. It takes attention to shifting and does not have a positive feel for which gear it goes into.

On November 21st, we started receiving phone calls from Ally Financial stating we missed our payment!
      We never received notification from Airpark that Ally held the note on our Jeep and not Chase Bank. We never received any loan payment information indicating we had a loan with Ally Financial. We did receive loan payment information from Chase bank so we promptly paid the loan. Airpark discovered there are/were two loan contracts created for our vehicle, BUT they neglected to notify us that they submitted our contract to a new lender.We continue to get daily phone calls from Ally after we escalated the calls to Ally's management team where they assured us the calls would stop, and they would be working with Airpark dealership's financial department to get this straightened out ASAP. The Dealership financial management became involved after we couldn't get responses or returned calls from our finance contact person.

"Bought it new from Lester Glenn, Toms River NJ, paid 42k. Was originally offered a year of free oil changes in writing, they never honored them - too much hassle so I just do it myself. Constantly receiving recall notices since 8 months after purchase and to this day (10/2016), Schedule with Cherry Hill Triplex to perform said recalls on several occasions - take off from work and then they tell me they don't have the parts and to keep calling them like it's my responsibility?? This has happened twice so far.
      Third time they actually repaired the visor recalled due to possible fire damage. Tried to get leather dash fixed, scheduled a time, took a day off, got there and they said warranty guy was off today, eventually got there when he was in and he look at the dash issues bubbling - signs of peeling with around 20k miles on it, they said it wasn't covered and never even documented the visit. So now I have only 27k miles but exceeded the three year limit so Jeep Corporate says they would have covered it under warranty but not now, they offered a ""friendly"", ""We'll pay the labor. You pay towards the dash @ $800 or something."" I spent like 12k extra for all the fancy leather & gadgets and it won't even last 4 years.",1.0

"Let me start from the beginning. I bought a brand new 2015 Jeep Renegade. First week the brakes and rotors had to be changed then week 2 I took in for capless gas tank not letting me fit the nozzle in and an extremely rough idle. They did a software update on it and said nothing was wrong with the gas tank. Next, I take in again because motor is extremely rough and still not able to put the nozzle in without having to fight with the nozzle and force it in. Salesmen and managers all experience this and the extremely rough idle. They tell me the parts are on back order so I take to another dealership who does 5 more motor updates and I call customer care about the parts being on back order and them not being able to fix the rough idle either. She tells me they would overnight the parts. This actually takes a week.
      I ask for a rental car and they tell me that there none available because of the long weekend which is a lie so I ask Sarah the customer care lady in charge of my case if I can rent my own and be reimbursed, she tells me yes. I go pick up my car a week later and still vibrates off and on like a week later. At this point I have had it in 4 times for the same issue. The customer care lady would do nothing! She tells me I have to keep taking it in as long as it takes! I was so frustrated by her customer service and the lady at the car service center that I just traded it in and lost 4000.00 on trade in!

"I have a 2015 Jeep SRT bought in the dealer Flagship in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in April 2015. The Brembo calipers clear coat started to peel off around 9,500 miles and one year from purchase. I went to the dealer and after waiting several weeks for a response with no success, I had to contact them and they informed me this is an aesthetic issue that warranty would not cover! I tried to appeal that response but have never been able to get above the dealer level. I have tried every means possible, avoiding to go to the Puerto Rico Consumer Affairs Department, but the experience with Jeep-Chrysler's customer service has been the worst I have had in my life.
      Upon research in the web I found that this is a very common problem to SRT owners and the feeling is the same; Jeep-Chrysler does not want to be responsible about this manufacturing issue and they avoid covering it under warranty. This is an SUV which base price is $65,000 and here in Puerto Rico, taxes included, is almost $80,000! It is incredible that a vehicle of such a high price has such a poor quality material and manufacturing in a part that is one of its main visual attributes. Anyone knows that this part is exposed to high temperatures and Jeep-Chrysler engineers should know better. I wish there is something that Consumer Affairs can do to help us Jeep SRT owners with this issue. I will be exploring the possibility of a class action against Jeep-Chrysler, among other causes of action for this abusive and elusive warranty scam.",1.0
"I purchase my vehicle with 33k on it 3 weeks ago. It is in for service for the 3rd time (I haven't even made a payment yet). 4 times now the transmission drags when leaving a stop and then clunks into gear. Before the 2nd service visit, I was driving down the highway and a loud alarm went off (not a ding or a chime) and there was something red on the display but it was gone before I could read it. My heart was jumping out of my chest as I was in rush hour interstate traffic and I thought it was going to stop. No codes the 1st and 2nd time so nothing was done.

"I have purchased a brand new 2016 Jeep Latitude. 900 miles in, I notice a high pitch noise coming from undercarriage. When I shift into neutral the sound goes away. I took in to the dealer in fulton missouri for service on the issue. They clearly could hear the noise but the diagnostic machine shows no issues. They called Chrysler corp. Chrysler told them that they were aware of the problem but do not know what it is, they are working on it. They said there is no fix as of now and the dealer has just sent me home with this defective vehicle. I'm reporting this because I want others to be aware of this problem before they run down to purchase this vehicle. Basically they want me to just drive it until whatever is wrong breaks all the way down. This is my first new vehicle, I'm not sure really what to do. 
      The fulton dealer is willing to take it as a trade in but they are trying to talk me out of that and finally took me to a 2015 with close to 30,000 miles on it as I wonder why someone traded that back in, hmm, maybe it had transmission problem too. They also offered an extended warranty on the problem. My thing is I have bought a brand new vehicle with a problem that more than likely is going to have more problems! I'm wondering if anyone has one of these vehicles with the same issue, or perhaps I've purchased what will become a lemon for sure. I've seen the transmission problems here on the 2014 and 2015 models. It looks to me like Chrysler has had this problem for a couple of years and I don't understand how they don't know what is wrong with their product. I paid 28000.00 for this vehicle and I will lose a couple thousand dollars if I trade it back in as it now has 1041 miles on it. I wish I would have seen these complaints before I went with a jeep product. The problem is I do like the vehicle, I took a long time to decide on this thing and went with what I liked best. Again does anyone have this vehicle who has not had any problems at all with it. I'm willing to trade for exact same one if there is a chance I've just picked a bad one in the bunch. I do think these corporations should not be able to stick you with a defective product right out the gate. I do understand there is a lemon law, but it has to be in many times for the same thing and as of now there is no record of a repair because they don't know what to repair! Very upset about my first new car experience.UPDATED ON 04/29/2016: My 2016 jeep Latitude is a 4x4. Like I said the high pitch noise goes away if the vehicle is shifted into park or neutral. With the vehicle in park, when I turn the 4x4 knob from auto to snow etc. I hear the high pitch ring shortly as it is switch into diff 4x4 options. Vehicle is still in the Park position. This leads me to believe this problem is in this 4x4 switch. I returned to the dealer to let them know what I had found. They said they would make a note. I also told them I had never in my life taken a vehicle into a mechanic who came out and told me ""yes there is something wrong with your vehicle but we don't know what it is"" and still could not believe Chrysler Corp mechanics don't have a clue.Perhaps they should hire me, as I have given them more info on the problem than they have given me. I also told them I have gone to the Ford Dealer here in Fulton and found they have a Chrysler lot in Illinois and are willing to take this vehicle in as a trade on a new vehicle with 3 miles that has no 4 wheel drive options on it. That was my request - get rid of the 4x4 and get rid of problem. Again I would like to know if anyone is having this issue with a 2016 Jeep latitude. I left the Fulton Chrysler dealer and within 20 min or so I was being called by a salesman.Now mind you the salesman calling me is not even the one who sold me the vehicle in the first place. He ducks me when I go in. So salesman calls me and says ""we don't want to lose your business"" and to give them a chance before I trade in to ford. I tell them I want a new vehicle with the same low miles. That was 20 miles when I purchased it the first time. I understood I had 1041 miles on this one but I was removing the add on of the 4x4 to a fwd instead. I still wanted the v6 option and they could even drop the 8.0 u connect. These 2 add ons equal a little over 2000 dollars. I was interested in a even trade out. Or they could just purchase this vehicle back from me.Well that statement got a stutter from the salesman. They call me back maybe 45 min later. They tell me they have good news and bad news. The good news is they can even trade for a model that has no v6, no power seat, no 8.0 uconnect. No 4x4. Or they can give me exactly what I want - no 4x4, no 8.0 uconnect, I'll have power seats and v6 engine but it will cost me 2995.00. Oh and they will give me 25000.00 for my trade in. Which I paid 28000.00 for. So Ive lost 3000.00 on the price, I've dropped over 2000.00 in options and they want another 2995.00 to do the deal. Does not sound like a deal to me. I still have my vehicle and am waiting on Ford Dealer to call with their deal. Still don't know what will happen.",1.0
"Fuel blow back is well documented on the internet with Jeep and Chrysler models. Recalls have been initiated on some models, namely 2007-2009 Wrangler but the problem has not resulted in mass recalls. This is clearly a huge safety and liability issue for Jeep which could easily result in bodily injury, death or large loss of property as result of what is clearly a manufacturing defect. The check valve for the fuel system unlike other cars is not located in the fuel filler tube, it is in the tank itself. The cost to diagnose the problem was $146.50 and the cost to repair (replacing the entire fuel tank) is $1370.81 for a total out of pocket expense of $1517.31.
      The car is a single owner purchased new with only 28k miles. Fuel tanks are meant to last the lifetime of a vehicle where no collision or other mishap has occurred. There is nothing a consumer can do to mitigate, meaning no means of servicing or maintenance should be necessary. Waiting on a certain number of specific complaints or a class action lawsuit to address a problem is unacceptable. DO NOT BUY A JEEP OR CHRYSLER PRODUCT.",1.0
"I have had NOTHING but problems since I purchased a Jeep. RECALLS that do NOT HAPPEN, years pass, then they supposedly fix it and soon afterwards you have major problems. The p41 recall is a joke and a scam. They never had the proper part to fix the problem. They were getting a lot of complaints and having to pay for rental vehicles for people who complained to their attorney generals. Then they lie to you and tell you the part is available when it isn't. When you catch them in their LIE, they back off and wait a few months and then tell you the part is available. Shortly thereafter, your starter is fried??? This company is evil to the bone and if you are a FOOL...then go buy a Jeep.",1.0

"Purchased Jeep used in 2011. In 2013 shifter plate failed. Required purchasing full shifter assembly to replace plate-cost $650+ plus labor. Total around $895. After another 20,000 miles, the same plate failed. This time the assembly part was $725. With labor totaled $954. Totally dissatisfied with that manufacturer design. Will never consider another Jeep as long as they use that design. Chrysler Jeep has no recall on this item, but they should. Customer service rep was very nice, but they don't do a recall unless there enough complaints. With the part being so readily available they must get a lot of replacements requests. Need more complaints.",1.0
"So I have a 2012 Jeep Patriot that at 107,000 miles dropped the tranny. It had a 100,000 mile warranty. I brought it into Macdonald motors in Bridgton, ME at 87,000 miles because it was acting up. They told me it was the spark plugs, not the transmission. It's the junk CVT, so I changed the plugs thinking I just wasn't used to that style of tranny. Helped with the skipping but not the hesitation and dead spot on take offs. In June we were getting ready to head to Moosehead for vacation and it started getting worse. I drove it right over to them again and asked to have it looked at before we left in case I needed to leave it. They sent a guy out, he drove it and said it was fine. This was still during the warranty period. They never made a record of it. Less than 10,000 miles later it completely quits, failing every test they can do. 
      At this point it is now out of warranty- amazing how that happens isn't it. Because it is over warranty and Macdonald motors doesn't show multiple complaints on it, I am stuck with the entire $4000 bill. There was obviously something wrong with it the whole time and Macdonald was avoiding the warranty, with jeep playing right along. Between me, my inlaws and my father we have bought 7 jeeps since 2000. There will not be another. I suggest everyone avoid Chrysler products, especially jeeps, and do not trust Macdonald motors. Your warranty means nothing.",1.0
"THE ACCURATE PART - Purchased in November 2015 2005 Jeep Liberty Renegade. 1/22/16 in the evening, my 16 year old son had JUST gotten off the highway and was coming into town (at 25 mph thankfully), felt a jerk and heard a noise. Pulled over immediately. Bottom line, the control arms were rusted the whole way through... recall issue. I called them and they said they would pay for tow. I have tried relentlessly (sometimes nicely and sometimes not so nicely) to get them to pay for the 2 day rental that I had to pay for while the truck was in the shop. They said they wouldn't because it was outside their ""parameters"". THE FAIR PART - Buyer beware, check recalls etc BEFORE purchasing. 
      LESSON LEARNED (for both me, my friends and my 16 year old son and anyone that will listen to me) - NEVER buy Jeep Chrysler. They may or may not (typically not from what I am reading) provide you with acceptable customer service. The inconvenience is typical, that's life. But for me to have to pay out of pocket for their subpar equipment... not acceptable. The local dealership was friendly and as helpful as they could be considering all they really needed to do was fix the recall item (I did have them repair another separate issue at my cost). They were quick to get it repaired. I dealt with Aaron and thought he was professional and friendly.",1.0
"We have an 2010 Jeep Liberty Limited with a Sky Slider Roof that from the time we bought it used has been nothing but trouble. We bought the jeep two and half years ago from a Chrysler dealer. It was warrantied and after a week and half of ownership we took it in and had the roof checked out. It would not slide open from the back and a made a clicking noise. After much complaints and phone calls the dealership had it repaired but it took at least 1.5 weeks for the repair of roof because they didn't have a person that knew how to fix the problem. The noise is so loud that you can't enjoy your radio or conversations. The dealership said they did the repair out of courtesy and that I would had to pay over $1500 for the repair. Now, the roof is broken again and will not close all the way!!! I have been looking to find someone who knows how to fix it but no one will touch them. These roofs should be on recall!!!",1.0
"I purchased this 2007 Jeep Commander when it was 2 years old. It still had a factory warranty. It has been nothing but a piece of garbage. This is by far the worst vehicle that I have ever owned, or that anyone I know has ever owned. Nothing but a pile of troubles. Windows never worked right, sometimes they went up, and sometimes they get stuck (elect). Water leaks through the sunroof tubes because of poor design. They need to be cleaned out twice a year or my car will be soaking wet and leaking from the handles and down through the doors to the floor. When heater turns on, makes loud squealing sounds, and to turn heat off you have to hit the ac switch. Seats also had bad wiring and would not adjust back and forth.
      I do regular maintenance on my car every three months, and my vehicle is garage kept. Ever since I had this Jeep, it stalls, won't start on first crank intermittently, shuts off while driving, and windshield wipers work when they decide to go on for no apparent reason. When I take it for service, no one sees anything wrong with it. No codes, no problems when test driving. Everytime I get this Commander out of the garage, two months later it is being towed in for another problem. In the last 15 months, I have had to replace the oil pan (really??? Rusted completely through), water pump, fuel pump, leaking transmission lines (poor design, rubbing together), crank sensor, and NOW to my amazement the ECM.Really??? I want to puke. Got to fix it, so that I can get rid of it. Because I NEVER want to look at another Jeep/Chrysler product again. I really hate the fact that someone else has to get this money trap junk. Because that is exactly what it is!!! When this Jeep hit 100,000 miles, which was 15 months ago, it has proved to be moneymaker for Jeep parts and labor, and a real unreliable vehicle for the owner. Let's not forget all the electrical and design problems it has had from the start. I am still at a shock about the computer system going bad. Yeah 1400.00, that never should have happened!!! I cannot wait to get it fixed and get it out of my name.",1.0
"This car is such a lemon and even worse. FCA never would honor even the basic warranty. I owned this POS for 8 months and was overjoyed when I was able to trade it. The transmission is the worst shifting vehicle ever and it was useless as a 4WD because the transmission would overheat and disable 4WD every time it went off road. Nine trips to two different dealers and they just repeat the BS phrase of ""Operating as Intended"" and ""Can't duplicate the problem"". The car is dangerous in traffic and breaks down off road, a total disaster. I will never buy a Fiat Chrysler again and think this corporation should be prosecuted for out and out fraud for not honoring warranties.

"I purchased a new Jeep Patriot in June of 2010. I used the car to commute to work for about 10 months before changing jobs to work from home. For four years, the car was driven very little and at the time of this review it has less than 33k miles on it. I noticed a loud noise anytime the clutch was not engaged so I took it to the dealership. It turns out vehicle, at 33k miles, needs a new transmission, and of course, the powertrain warranty expired 4 months ago. ""Linda"" from Jeep customer services ""fully appreciates my concern"" particularly regarding the expense ($4800+). She ""appreciates the opportunity to review your request"", but... you know how the rest goes. My recommendation is not to fall in love with these cars, and definitely don't purchase from a company that doesn't stand by their product.",1.0
"I purchased my Jeep Grand Cherokee Eco GC Diesel in September 2014 and since then I have had multiple issues. Check Engine light constantly goes on and they say it needs to be updated when serviced... Well service doesn't do this regularly. Filled up my DEF with the same stuff I always fill it up with and all of a sudden when driving home it states ""Incorrect DEF fluid. See dealership."" Then all my lights start to flash and I get a message that says ""Engine will NOT restart in 175 KM."" Well it's Sunday and no freaking dealership service department is open. Not impressed!! When you buy a $60,000 new vehicle it should not have issues like this. 
      Camrose and Sherwood Park dealerships: When I bought from Camrose dealership they never even told me it needed DEF so just about ran out. Also when I asked if I could get the oil changed anywhere they said yes... Well guess what? You can't. You can only get it changed at a dealership as they do not sell the filters to anyone BUT the dealerships. Took it into Sherwood Park dealership to get it serviced and have the updates done and guess what? They charged me an outrageous to get the oil change and then never even did the updates. Asked them to do the updates and they said I would have to book an appointment with the service department. When I went to book an appointment they didn't even know what I was wanting when asking for them to update the computer system. Thirdly Asked them to clear the check engine light so I could at least use my command start and the Techs there didn't even know how to do this. Super frustrated with my Jeep and both dealerships.",1.0

"Ground squirrels chewed through the wire to my horn and I took my Jeep in to the dealer. They said the warranty did not cover the repair job, and said it would take 1 and 1/2 hours to fix.

I told them it should have been covered and that I would let their competitors know that the Mighty Jeep is not rodent proof! They laughed and took my money. I had a GMC Sierra for 17 years and never had any rodent problems. I think Jeep has a design problem. I looked into rodent problems online and found this to be more common a problem that most would think. Will wait for the class action lawsuit to get my money back!

"After the hitch recall was conducted I have lost capabilities of my vehicle due to the manufacturer (JEEP). I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty CRD delivered by Jeep with a trailer hitch and wiring. The tow rating of 5000lbs was the only reason the jeep was purchased with the benefit of a diesel engine for better mpg. I was informed by mail a recall was necessary to prevent damage to the fuel tank and fire in case of an accident. When I asked the service manager at Ourisman Jeep in Clarksville, MD, I was told the N46 recall consisted of an inspection of the installed hitch and a possible replacement hitch if the original failed inspection. I was told there should be no other issues. When I got the Jeep back, I was told the hitch was replaced and I was ""good to go"". 
      While waiting on the Jeep, I read the paperwork which stated my vehicle did not come equipped for towing (it did come equipped for towing) and that I could not tow with the hitch that was now installed. I asked about this and was told by the service manager at Ourisman it was just legalese to cover their butt and not to worry, tow as before. I became concerned as I use the Jeep regularly to tow and have not used it since as I am concerned if the tow hitch Ourisman installed fails I will be held liable as Jeep says I cannot tow in the paperwork. I emailed jeep and received the following: ""Thank you for contacting the Jeep Customer Assistance Center. We regret to learn of your concerns regarding the ability to tow with this new hitch. We regret to inform you that we are unable to diagnose or advise if your vehicle is safe regarding if you can tow with this new trailer hitch that was installed. There are too many variables involved and a detailed inspection of your vehicle is required for proper diagnosis. If you choose to use the new hitch for towing, you are responsible for any damage it may or may not cause.""Based on that I wrote back asking why I went from a vehicle that could tow to one that couldn't and why it wasn't mentioned previously. The response was: ""We reviewed your concerns further in regards to obtain further clarification on if you are able to tow with this new hitch. FCA US LLC and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have agreed on this repair action. The repair procedure set out by FCA US LLC meets these requirements that were set out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The trailer-hitch assemblies installed as part of this campaign are intended only to provide rear structural reinforcement. Hitch-balls were not to be installed and customers are not advised to operate their vehicles with exposed hitch-balls. We apologize this information does not assist you with your concerns; however, we must stand behind our decision to advise you not to tow with this hitch.""I am unsure who else to actually contact as the manufacturer and the dealer have now basically stolen from me the only reason I own the vehicle. I also don't understand how they would replace a hitch when I told them I use it for towing and later say it wasn't their call. I did email the BBB, they should respond in 30 days. I contacted NHTSA and received this in response: ""Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Transportation's Vehicle Safety Hotline Information Center. For recall inquiries on your specific vehicle, safety seat, or other equipment please contact the manufacturer. We hope that you find this information helpful. However, if you need additional information on our services please feel free to contact us at 1-888-327-4236.""I started out just wanting the jeep back to where I can tow. But since Jeep refuses and is saying that it was approved by NHTSA to get lost or at least that's what the last email from Jeep seems to say, I don't want it anymore as I can't use it. Now I think based on the paperwork I likely can't even sell the jeep to anyone planning to tow as even though it was rated to tow it now has paperwork saying not to. And even had Jeep offered to buy it back and give credit toward buying another Jeep/Chrysler/Dodge I won't. I won't buy another Chrysler product after this. This has completely turned me off the Company, even though I have been a lifelong Mopar Enthusiast, having owned a 68 Roadrunner, 87 Ram and a 2002 Quad Cab Dakota that was one of my previous tow vehicles. So now I have to begin a search for another vehicle that meets the need the Liberty was filling so I can have a vehicle to tow with; the ideal being a small 4x4 with a tow capacity of at least 5000lbs. And find a way to sell or trade the Jeep as I cannot justify continuing making payments on a vehicle I cannot use due to the fast one pulled by Jeep.",1.0

"I am 65 years old, and purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty on June 12, 2014. I had no idea of the fuel tank installed behind the rear axle. Prior to purchase, I had done a CarFax report that revealed no recalls. Shortly thereafter I received a notice of recall on the trailer hitch and waited 9 months for the replacement hitch to be available and had it replaced at the Chrysler dealership. No one ever told me about the gas tank mounting behind the rear axle and that 75 people had been burnt to death in rear collisions. Now I am stuck with a vehicle I still owe $8000 on and no one wants to buy.

"I called last week to simply find out a price on a vehicle. I spoke to Trevor who kept me on the phone for 20 minutes trying to get me to come down there to purchase this same vehicle. I told him there was no way I was driving 4 hours to be disappointed and come home with nothing. I've had over 12 vehicles and I know how this operation works. I told him about my proposal I have with a dealer here and the price they were giving me for my trade. They unfortunately didn't have the color jeep I wanted. He guaranteed that he could get me to a payment of $300 or under. I still said I don't believe it and will not drive there until I know you can sell this vehicle for this amount and that I have it in writing. At this point he said even if we lose money we want your business. I told him I'd call Monday since I'd be away all weekend. In the meantime my friend Greg also called and spoke to Trevor about numbers and he promised he could get us there. 
      So last evening we made the 2-hour one-way drive to find out it was all a lie. The numbers were way off. You wouldn't give me the discount promised. I left absolutely devastated. My suggestion to Trevor and the rest of your team is not to make empty promises to prospective buyers. You wasted 5 hours of driving and caused a lot of heartache. I will never recommend anyone to your dealership. As matter of fact, I will tell everyone I know to steer clear. I will be writing a letter to Jeep corporate customer satisfaction on how no one there would take any responsibility for their dishonest actions and misleading representations over the phone. Especially with a new salesperson they have on staff that is representing them. They promised $11,500 for my trade and $2300 in rebates. We got there and they would only discount the jeep $1165 and would only give me $10,000 for my car.",1.0
"Where do I begin? I bought this Jeep brand new and outright with 36 miles when I drove it off the lot. It was great until 40,000 miles I had to replace everything in the front end. Mind you this vehicle is not used for off road. It is used for basic daily driving to and from work, errands, etc. After that was replaced I made a turn only to have scalding hot water pour into my driving foot while wearing sandals. I took it back to the dealership and asked to be notified of the problem before it was fixed. I was not called until the end of the day when I was told to pick up my vehicle. I was then told it was a clogged AC unit and was charged $300. They did the work without my consent. The troubles kept coming after that! About a year ago while driving down the road, my car began to violently shake with my daughter in the vehicle with me. My tie rod broke while driving about 40mph. 
      Luckily I did not crash and was able to gain control of the vehicle and pull off the road. That makes the second time things in the front end were replaced all before 100,000 miles. I am now over 100,000 and no longer have a warranty. Two months ago I paid 1,000 for engine issues. My traction control light is always on, now my check oil light is on and dinging over and over while driving. There is a sensor failure that informs the car of the oil pressure. I have plenty of oil. Then I went to leave for work and my Jeep would not release the shifter out of park. Upon research this is an electrical issue where the transmission does not recognize the brake is being pressed to release the vehicle out of park. I was finally able to get it out. My blower motor for the hot and cold air does not work and needs to be replaced. I also have paint bubbling up right above the windshield and the roof of the vehicle. Not sure if this is related but in New England winters like this past one where we have a ton of snow and ice I have water that leaks into my interior light and comes through the light. So basically my car sucks and I thought I would at least be able to get two more years before I had to buy a new vehicle but this is not the case. I am having more and more issues! So from 40,000 to its current 119,000 this car has been nothing but a headache! I am so disappointed and so badly want to call Chrysler and tell them all the issues I've had in a basically brand new vehicle (I know it's not now but at 40,000 it still was). I've owned many Jeeps over the years and I will not be purchasing another Jeep!!! I don't feel safe even driving to work in this POS!!! It looks nice on the outside but just ask me about the anxiety, stress, headache and money this vehicle has cost me and you won't think it's so nice!!!",1.0
"I purchased my jeep in February of 2015 from Mancari's Chrysler in Oak Lawn, IL. My experience with the purchase was horrific, as they sold me a 2 wheel drive for the price of an 4X4. Tried to tell me I had an 4X4, but my insurance company stated that according to the VIN it was a 2x4. They argued with me back and forth before they finally said the insurance company was right. You would think they would give me a 4x4, no, they did not without me having to put an additional 2 thousand dollars down on it. Okay, I did that. Got my 4x4 and moved on. Then I get the recall notice for R01. Took it in of course and afterwards, the Jeep did not drive the same. A lot of jerking/coughing going on. When I stop at a light, and when the light turns green, I go forward, the Jeep stalls before it would go. Same thing occurs when I make a turn. It could cause someone to run into me from the back because the Jeep stalls. 
      Okay, took it back in, but then I got the recall for a R05. So while getting the second recall done, they were going to look at the issues I explained as well. When I left they said they looked at it and all was fine. Well everything was not fine, it continued to do the same thing. Took it back. They tells me that my 9.V engine is causing the Jeep to do that, and that is the way it is and nothing is wrong with it. On the way home, my entire dashboard goes dark and the ceiling light keeps popping on and off. The next day the check engine lights comes on. Took it back in, but to a different Jeep service department. They had it all day, only to tell me nothing was wrong. That was two days ago. Today while driving to the train station, my check engine light comes on again. WTF!!! Jeep is a piece of JUNK. Please DO NOT PURCHASE A JEEP!!!",2.0

"2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited - Never liked how my transmission shifted but was told by salesman that is how the 9 speed reacted. Received recall in April 2015 for PCM and TCM. Had the updates installed. Informed Jeep dealership there was an issue with my tranny. Made appt on Jun 25, 2015. They couldn't verify my concern but would note it as such. Stated they did install a new flash update. On July 1, 2015 I was stopped at an intersection. Light turned green, partway through intersection my jeep came to an instant stop. My park sense, ignition, and crash warning lights went off as well as my transmission. I could not get my vehicle started. After several attempts it started and as I shifted to drive I heard a loud clanking sound. I was able to hobble the jeep to the dealership. 
      As of today, July 7th, they have ordered a valve body and transmission wiring harness. My vehicle has less than 9000 miles. The instant stall could have caused a serious accident with the potential for a fatality. Thank goodness it was during early morning hours.

Spoke to the person dealing with my case, explained my concerns, told her needed a case number, said I needed the manager whom is not in. I'm extremely frustrated, freaking out. My job doesn't allow me to take time off for this type of issues. To make matters worse, I been having this issue one month in after getting the car and just now manage to have a day off to schedule yet another appointment. A year later!! Someone please help. 50,000 plus down the drain. I'm very disappointed. My first jeep.",1.0

"I own a 2005 Jeep Liberty which I bought brand new in Dec 2005. This past weekend it broke down - luckily I wasn't driving on the freeway. I heard a clunk and a police officer was behind me and when I stopped to see what it was he said ""I heard the loud noise."" And he then told me that I wouldn't be able to continue driving and it would have to be towed. So I had to wait for a tow for over 45 minutes and the tow person told me that it was a broken rear suspension control arm and he said that there was a recall on this for 2004 and 2005 Jeep Liberties.
      So I called Woodhouse in Blair and was informed that because my vehicle wasn't put together in the right state that my Vin# wasn't on the recall list. This is a bunch of B.S. I have purchased Three Jeeps. But I will never again purchase a Chrysler product. They have lost my business forever. If the part is defective it should go for all Jeep Liberty's. Just because you don't live in the right state they won't cover it. Chrysler Corporation SUCKS!!! I Hope your corporation goes Bankrupt it will serve you right. And let's hope no one gets killed in an accident that is the cause of your company not wanting to fix something that has been recalled, but they won't fix it because the car wasn't put together in the correct State.",1.0
"Brand new 2014 jeep wrangler Rubicon started malfunction at 5000 miles. Lights shorting out, tpms fully malfunctioning and doesn't recognize where any of my tires are even after 3 new modules replaced. My radio now doesn't work as it goes nuts with the buttons flashing etc. when car is on and the worst part is my Jeep turning on by itself in my driveway middle of night without the keys!!! They have had me into dealership for 7 months now. 12 plus visits, over 5 rental cars and to this day I have no answers. The resolution department does nothing but make you run in circles and has not offered to help in any way. I spent over $50,000 on this top of line Jeep to get no accountability from the manufacturer on these problems. 
      When their own dealership told me to hire a lawyer AND the customer service dept of Jeep says the same thing after looking over my STAR report.... well looks like I'm getting a lawyer. Lucky I live in California where they have to give me every penny back, my down payment and pay for my lawyer. I used to love my Jeep. Now I just have a bad taste in my mouth from this company.",1.0

"I purchased 2013 Jeep Patriot Latitude in January of 2013. Since the car was purchased, I have had nothing but problems. The first issue was that the windshield wipers kept turning on by themselves. I took the car back to the dealership's service department only to be told that a ''star case'' was made. No resolution. The second issue that occurred was where the car completely stalled out at 10 MPH which nearly caused a terrible accident that could have injured myself and my 9 year old daughter. I had to turn the car off, wait and then turn it back on. The car stalled again. After 20 minutes of waiting, the car began to drive as normal. I took the car back to the dealership AGAIN. The service manager kept my Jeep for the entire day (keep in mind that they do not even issue rentals) and called to tell me that ANOTHER STAR CASE was made.
      After my third visit for the stalling issue and for the windshield wipers, the dealership finally decided to change the wipers relay switch which seemed to stop the problem. After 5 visits for the stalling issue, there still has not been any resolution. I have contacted Jeep over three times, via phone and by the email on the site and still have yet to be contacted from the ''representative in one business day.'' I am furious that I cannot get any type of satisfactory service. I will NEVER purchase another Chrysler product. I have began exploring other options for a new vehicle which is sad being that I am a single father who just needs reliable transportation to provide for his daughter. Oh by the way, today is 5/15/15, I had to take my Jeep into the service dealership at 10:15AM EST for yet another diagnostic check.",1.0
"Sometimes my Jeep Liberty '05 will stall while I'm driving, many time when I'm making a turn! This is so scary that I stopped driving it when it's raining, because that's usually when it happens. I called Chrysler and they said it's my responsibility to maintain my vehicle. We have 4 and the jeep is the only one that malfunctions. They'll have a huge lawsuit on their hands, or they could just fix the issue with all jeeps. There are thousands of complaints online about this issue and something needs to be done about it or someone will get killed driving their jeep! My daughter drives it sometimes and it scares her too!

Without even asking or talking about it!!! And he repeats again with a cheeky smile. Then I realise he isn't joking... I was not impressed! Eventually he got me to try it. Must admit he made a fine choice. Amazing value for money, drives very nice and great fuel economy. Highly recommended.

Since I was in rural Arizona, it was difficult to find a dealer, but I managed. 10 weeks later, my car still isn't repaired. Chrysler's customer service has been erratic and unhelpful, they claim that there are problems locating the parts needed to repair the car. Most disappointing, however, is the company's complete lack of concern for my dilemma. My personal expenses have been significant, the company barely communicates with me, and won't commit to anything at all. No car, no repair, no compensation and above all, NO APOLOGIES.",1.0

"I have had a number of issues with my '09 Jeep Patriot, I am not sure where to begin. I've still have a leaky sunroof that I've given up on ever getting repaired. My Patriot was at the dealer (Hickman Motors) for almost 2 months trying to find a problem with a defective driver's side airbag switch, only to finally discover that it wasn't connected properly by the technician who did the diagnostics. 
      Backtrack. When I purchased the Patriot from Hickman Motors, it had less than 60,000 Km on it. The salesman (**) told me that it had 2 years, Bumper to Bumper, left on the Extended Service Warranty that covered everything except oil changes, wipers, tires, brakes, etc. Shortly after purchasing the vehicle, I noticed that the gearshift would occasionally pop out of gear and the shiftier knob, itself, would pop off. This issue was bought to the attention of the service department on several occasions. After replacing the shiftier knob, they determined that the transmission was ok. The problem progressively got worse, to the point that I would have to turn off the engine in order to change into 1st or reverse gear.Long story short, now that the vehicle is no longer under warranty, they advise me that parts in the transmission need to be replaced and it would cost me approximately $2000. I spoke with the dealer and the Chrysler ""could -care -less"" rep and was told that there was nothing they could do because the warranties have expired. All I received was an apology from Chrysler and deniability and avoidance from the dealer that this problem was an ongoing issue (even though I have documentation to the contrary). I eventually took the Patriot to a specialty transmission shop and had the transmission repaired with ""quality parts' for less than have the dealer quote. I am pursuing this matter further. I simply wanted to voice my concerns and caution prospective automotive buyers to stay away from Jeep products.PS: The issue with the rear end trailer arm assembly and suspension is another big problem that I will probably post about another day. Thank you for listening.",1.0
"I was sent a recall notice July 2014 regarding the ignition switch but was also told the part was not available to fix the problem. Several months passed and I contacted Jeep and was told again...""we'll let you know when the part is available."" It's now 8 months later and STILL the part is not available. Meanwhile, I have to drive with no key ring (which has caused me to lose the key several times), and the real issue is that it could cause an accident. Why can't a million dollar corporation such as chrysler fix a defect that their company is responsible for and could cause an accident and loss of life? I could understand waiting a month or two for the part, but 8 months and still no idea when the part will be available is just wrong and totally unacceptable.",1.0
"Purchased this vehicle and discovered its 9 speed transmission did not use 9th gear. After multiple visits to service dept. I was finally told I would probably never see 9th gear as it was developed more for the European market where speeds could reach above 80 mph. Many squeaks, and odd noises, no answers. Very jerky acceleration or very large delay, no fix for that either as it is a 9 speed electronic transmission. Very disappointed in this purchase as I have owned Chrysler/Jeep for over 20 years and this is by far the worst vehicle I have had with their name on it.",1.0

"I purchased a 2013 Jeep Rubicon of Valentine's Day 2014 from Bob Baker Jeep in Carlsbad CA including a Premium Maintenance Package for my wife. It has been a struggle to get the maintenance performed on the vehicle (oil and tire rotation). The front tires were wearing irregular causing a really rough ride and a lot of noise. I took it to the first dealer twice and they indicated that there was no problem. I called Chrysler Customer Care and they sent me to Big O Tires for an inspection. Big O said the tires were bad due to a suspension issue. I took the Jeep to a second dealership and they said it was not a car problem and it was a tire problem. This evaluation was done solely by a visual inspection. I called Customer care back and they had me take it back to the dealer for yet another inspection. 
      They determined that there was no problem in the suspension. They determined that that the tires needed to be rotated very 6K miles or at every oil change. The premium maintenance package that was sold to me which was specifically for the Rubicon only specifies rotation to be done every 10K miles. At this point customer care says it's not their problem. The dealer has only offered to pick up half of the cost (their retail price) of 2 new tires and will not change the maintenance plan to meet the minimum recommended maintenance (ie. tire rotation at every oil chance). Or I can buy another maintenance plan. I will NEVER buy another Chrysler!!!!!PS. I was able to work with BF Goodrich and independent tire dealer (Americas Tire) to get 2 new tires for the same price as the half off price of the Chrysler dealership. It includes tire rotation for the life of the tire for free. The customer care group at Chrysler have been the worst group I have ever dealt with!!!!!!!! They don't return calls or respond.",1.0

The most significant issue is that my Jeep will die while in Drive and Reverse, thus making it very dangerous to drive. Everyone seems to have the same issues as well.

"2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredo - I lost control of my Jeep traveling 57-60 mph.

Each roll my head slammed into the window. I did not have the strength to save myself. After the first hard slam I was just a flop.

"I used to own a 2010 Jeep Patriot. I have driven Jeep for 21 years until today, 12/8/14. The vehicle in question was not paid off and not even five years old. Both ball joints went bad in the vehicle and had to be replaced. This is unacceptable for a vehicle this young. The first ball joint was fixed under warranty. The second ball joint went bad not even a full year later. I contacted Jeep about the issue and faxed them all of my paperwork from my mechanic. I was then strung along for over two months and finally got an answer that they would not reimburse me the part and labor for putting in the other ball joint. The customer service representative that handled my case I found to be condescending and aloof. 
      So for Jeep to save a couple of hundred dollars they are willing to let a customer go who was willing to stick with Jeep for life.

"2007 jeep compass sport - A few weeks ago after hitting a bump, the lighting bolt light came on and the jeep starting shaking and sounding like it was about to die. When trying to press the gas, the jeep seemed like it wasn't getting any gas and would shake really bad. Even just sitting in drive or reverse, the idle sounded like it was about to die. We took the cables off the battery for about 5 mins, put them back on and the jeep ran fine for about 3 weeks. Today it did the same thing so we got some gas treatment and it kept doing the same thing. When we tried pressing the gas, the jeep would start shaking really bad and sound like it's about to die. After some thinking we decided to take the cables off the battery again for about 5 mins and sure enough we turned the jeep on. And sitting in drive and reverse, the idle was fine. And we drove around the parking lot and no lighting bolt light, no shaky idle and it seemed to run just fine. Not sure what magic happens when we take off the cables to the battery but it has worked twice for us so far.

"2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit - On November 17th, after about 30 seconds driving forward, the car shifted from 2nd gear back to first gear. The car practically skidded to shift back to first. I was thrown forward in the car. Luckily, I wear my seat belt. It would not shift out of first after that. The engine light came on. I had it towed to the dealership where I bought it. They said something is wrong with the transmission. They said they could not fix the transmission, but would replace the entire transmission. They said with a car this new, they do not have the knowledge to fixing the transmissions. They replaced the transmission and drove it 200 miles. They said it is fixed. 
      I picked it up on a Monday, November 24 and drove it home. The next day, I had the problem again. When turning on 4 lane road (2 in one direction and two in another), the vehicle started to go across the intersection. It appeared to try to shift to 2nd, but the car stopped moving (like it was in neutral). I had to start blowing the horn as oncoming cars were coming at a high rate of speed. I could have killed. I immediately call the dealership. They picked the car up and drove it back to the dealership. They ran numerous tests on the car and could not duplicate the problem. They called and told me the car was ready.I have severe reservation about getting back in a vehicle that I could have been killed in and drive it away when I know, the dealership knows and Chrysler knows, they couldn't duplicate the problem and they didn't fix anything. So, basically, I will be driving a ticking time bomb that could blow up at any time. My wife, kids and grand-kids could be in jeopardy and other drivers on the road. I paid over 50K for this vehicle, only to find myself stressed out over this fact. I cannot get back into this vehicle knowing nothing was corrected and I was almost killed.",1.0
I purchased a 2014 Jeep Patriot new in July of 2014. In August I had to take it back in because the hood was lifting up and looked as if it were going to come off at freeway speeds. The windshield wiper smart switch also quit working. I was told that the hinges on the hood weren't very secure by design at the dealer but they replaced them anyway and it still wobbles going down the freeway and they replaced the smart switch. On November 21st I took it in again because there was a grinding noise coming from the front end. The dealer informed me that I had a defective transmission and they had to order one. On November 24th I took it back to have the new transmission put in and was told that it would be done on the 25th. When I called on the 25th they told me that the mechanic had stripped out the threads on a mounting bolt and had to put a heli-coil in it and it wouldn't be done until the 26th. I called on the 26th and they told me that one of the front drive axles was also defective and they had to order one. They were closed for Thanksgiving on the 27th so I called on the 28th and was told that the part was not in yet. It is now December 2nd and I still do not have a vehicle which I need to do my job so I have not been able to work for over a week!,1.0

My 7 year old daughter was in the car. I feared we were going to stall in the middle of the intersection of a busy street. All the dash lights came on and shut off repeatedly as we coasted around the turn. Car re-engaged and we pulled into a parking lot. Shut the car off. Went into Walmart. When we came out car started. Engine light on. Being only 1 mile from home we drove home. The next morning car wouldn't start. Got a new battery. Car still wouldn't start. Had it towed to dealership. Dealership replaced solenoid/starter.Sept 2014 -- Hesitates, Lights on dash on and off, Engine light on, problems starting. Drove to Dealership. Dealership can’t find any problems. Again, dashboard lights came and all shut off. Jeep is/was hesitating while driving and not engaging/changing gears while driving. Also, periodically accelerates randomly while driving. Dealership suggests replacing control module ($1300) and having wiring harness diagnosed ($600 for diagnosis not to fix it -- est. cost to replace wiring harness $1500 to $3000). But, they do NOT know what is wrong with the Jeep.Oct. 2014 -- Hesitates, Random Acceleration, Dash lights all on to all off. -- No Fix. Vehicle continues to have problems. As I cannot afford to keep replacing parts or diagnosing issues I drive it as it. I have 3 children that I will not drive in the Jeep any further away from home than a mile or 2… and will only drive with the children in the car on side streets or back roads. Therefore, my children do not go anywhere except the local park, to school, or to a friend’s house that lives nearby. They do not go to any store with me that is farther than 1 mile away, or that main roads have to be taken to get to it. Not included in the costs above are the car rental fees I have had to pay each time the car was under repair.Other misc. problems: Broken Door Handle, Sun Roof doesn't close properly, Poor Paint (Thin - scratches and rust), rough drive, a/c & heating only work on high. Chrysler issued recall P41 (Faulty Ignition) on Sept. 3 2014 but parts are not made to fix the problem YET. 2 Months from issued recall ""we"" are still waiting for Chrysler to make and distribute parts. Chrysler issued recall on Sept 21 (maybe 23) for recall of TIPM but only for SOME of the vehicles affected. 11/21/2014 Jeep lost power at 35mph. Re-engaged. 11/25/2014 Jeep lost power at 25mph. Re-engaged. 11/26/2014 Jeep lost power at 35mph. Re-engaged. Called Chrysler and was told there is nothing they can do about recall parts as the parts are not ready. There is no sense continuing to take the vehicle to be serviced as the problem does not seem to be able to be diagnosed properly. It does not seem to be able to be fixed.",1.0

"2014 Jeep Cherokee latitude Lemon - Problems since January. Newest problem needs cylinder head and was overheating. Not including the tranny wobble out of 1st and 2nd gear if it even moves. I feel very unsafe driving it and opened a ticket with corporate. Contacting lawyer, they had my jeep for over 1 week, no loaner. I have called them 2 times. Shouldn't they call me and get authorization to work on my car??? Super upset because it did drive well in the snow!
      Updated on 02/22/2015I had to get a lawyer. There is a laundry list of things that went wrong with my 2014 Jeep Cherokee. First, the second day I had it the check engine light came on. The dealership said it was the oxygen sensor, but it wasn't bad enough to change. That happened 3 times before they decided to change it. When the light came on I would get horrible gas mileage, but that's apparently not an issue to Jeep. The remote start doesn't work when the check engine light comes on which makes sense, but when you have to wait 2 weeks for a service visit in the dead of winter, not cool. Next the touch screen failed and they had to order it. Couldn't drive it heat in winter with my kids. The manual controls won't work if the touch screen malfunctions. Then after the first week the transmission was constantly acting funny, hesitating, and the mechanic would go on a test drive with us and couldn't deny our complaints. Then the head went on the engine, it overheated. It took over 40 days to diagnose. They gave a hard time about a free loaner car. I forgot to mention they keep greasing the suspension because it makes a grinding noise since about 400 miles. The transmission is still horrible, the updates seem to be made up. I tried trading it in and Bayside Jeep in Queens would not return my calls for a trade. A hand full of time the jeep wouldn't start, would appear to be dead, then 20 min later it would start. Unsafe in stop and go traffic, because it lunges forward and won't continue. I hear a loud clunk when that happens. The transmission or engine makes a weird gurgling noise. I got a lawyer because I was unhappy having a new jeep with replacement parts in the engine. It's a huge deal, I should have gotten a new one. The lawyer got them to buy my jeep back at full sales price, but I'm still losing rebates which = losing my trade in. I also had to pay for millage because of NYS Lemon Law. I don't have good credit so when I turn it in I will get back about 500.00 to start over. It takes another 6-7 months for NYS to refund tax/title/DMV fees. So I don't feel whole, and I have no idea what to get. Before this I a bmw, but it was rear wheel drive, and before that the had a 95 cheep grand cherokee that was great and still on the road. They don't make cars like they used to. I'm at a loss for what to purchase next, I've been burned by this experience.",1.0

The old systems never quit or had these problems but Chrysler had to reinvent the wheel. Over time I have had to get the driver side window repaired 5 times. Then all of a sudden one day the passenger side window just fell down. Had to have it repaired. Then I received a letter from Chrysler that they were extending the warranty on all window repairs to 7 years. Should tell you that there is a real problem if they have to extend the warranty. I also paid for extended warranty and that was a waste of money.Then all of a sudden one New Year's Eve the passenger side rear window fell down. Again went to a dealership and they did get warranty on it. Now the extended warranty was up on June 15, 2013. On July 1st 2013 the driver side rear window fell down and would not operate. This was the only window that hadn't been repaired yet. I went to a Chrysler dealership that I had never been to and they were refused warranty by Chrysler Canada. Now this dealership (Southtown Chrysler - Edmonton) who I never bought the vehicle from or ever been there before was so nice to me that they offered to not charge me labor if I paid for the part. This was fantastic service from the dealership and Chrysler doesn't deserve to have this quality of dealership. The dealership cared but Chrysler didn't.Now why should the dealership be out for Chrysler's poor design. I have since at least done other repair business with them but I will never give Chrysler business again. I contacted Chrysler 2 times about this issue. The first time they responded by telling me tough luck as the warranty was up. I could see if it was a year after but this happened 2 weeks after the warranty was up. I hardly use this vehicle and if had have happened 15 days earlier they would have repaired it. I sent them another email in response to their answer and in 4 months they haven't even had the courtesy to respond. I have decided to file this complaint so other people will know about their poor customer care.I hope other people listen and don't waste your money on their products or any of their extended warranty products as they also have a pile of loopholes and aren't worth the money.",1.0
"In 2010, I purchased a used 2007 Jeep Liberty Sport through a dealership. Within the first month after purchase, a mechanism within the front driver's side door broke causing the window to slip inside the door and become unusable. The dealership repaired the part free of charge as the vehicle was ""new to me"". In 2012, the same mechanism broke again. This time, I was told by the dealership that this is a common problem but I was forced to pay for the repair as Jeep has not yet recalled the mechanism.
      Yesterday, December 21, 2013, the mechanism broke again this time inside the passenger's front side door. I have called the dealership to schedule the repair but currently my window is being held up with duct tape. I do not think I should have to pay for the repair as this is an ongoing issue and obviously the cause of a defective part. Jeep should recall the component and/or develop a mechanism that does not break so easily. I have already filed a complaint with the NHTSA and Jeep headquarters.",1.0
"I bought my 2010 Jeep Liberty the later part of October 2013. I was extremely happy. It drove great. I loved the looks. It was very roomy, and comfortable. The beginning of December 2013 the alarm system will go off for no reason. The dome lights will come on for no reason, then go out. And a couple of days ago the engine started acting like it's going to die, then it's reeves back up. Today December 13, 2013, I was taking my daughter to school. I approached a traffic light that was red and cars were stopped. I began breaking, slowing down. When I was about 50 feet from the stopped car in front of me the engine reeved up like I had stomped the gas. It lunged forward causing me to rear end the car in front of me. My daughter will be 16, and was sitting in the passenger seat. Upon impact she lunged forwards striking her forehead on the dash board. My lower back is killing me. The woman I hit was not injured. Was wondering if this has happened to other owners? And if there was a defect in the jeep?",1.0
"I purchased a 2012 Jeep Patriot. It drove fine for the first 7,000 miles. From then on, I heard crunching and grinding whenever I would go over smallest bumps and speed bumps. Then, I brought it to the dealer. It was my struts and control arm. I do all highway mileage. At 11k, I feel a shake and wobble in front end. I brought it to dealer at least 10 times and complain to Chrysler that the dealer says they acknowledge an issue but can't figure it out. I am angry. I have a huge blowout on highway with my two young babies. I did not even hit anything and this is at 21k. They open a ""star case"" on it and some technician says it's my axles. They are blown. 
      I spent $400 on new tires and several trips to dealer wasting my time, and drove it 11k+ before they fixed it. It was fine for maybe a month plus, but now I hear grinding and clanking, also something loose. Plus the set button does not work sometimes on steering column. Very sluggish pick up during acceleration, hesitates when accelerating. I had to have power steering pump and serpentine pulley replaced at 20k. I HATE THIS JEEP and biggest mistake in my life. Now I am out of warranty slightly and I have to pay for it. I will NEVER buy anything American made vehicle again. Poorly made and very cheap. Worst choice I could have made buying a BRAND NEW VEHICLE.",1.0

While driving back home to other Elko, Nevada, wife notices passenger visor mirror is shattered. Dealer says it is under warranty.

"I own a 2007 Jeep Commander Limited 2WD, 5.7 Liter Hemi. The vehicle will lose power at unexpected times and this has happened on multiple occasions and at various speeds. The vehicle will lose power and buck forward as if it has been rear ended by another vehicle, but the engine will resume without having to be restarted by the ignition. However, during the hesitation, you can not accelerate, all power is lost. The vehicle is still under warranty and I have experienced this problem from 42,000 miles to 79,000 miles which is the current mileage. 
      It seems to happen every 3 months, putting mine and my family's life at risk. The dealership stated they can not fix the problem since the check engine light is not on, it doesn't throw a code, and they can not get the problem to duplicate on their test drive. There needs to be a safety recall on this dangerous situation before someone is hurt or killed!! I have contacted Consumer Affairs by email and encourage other Commander owners to do the same if you are experiencing this problem. www.consumeraffairs.com",1.0

At what point does JEEP repair this problem. The piece of equipment used is junk and this is well known and has not been resolved in way too many years. For a part that couldn't cost more than $10 to add to these areas to resolve the problem, this is very sad that they would not fix this and add cost of part to price of car instead of owners having to replace this part that has been known for failure and costing on average $700-$1200 to pull dash to fix blend doors and window motors are min of $50 with you fixing yourself, times the number of them that fail, and all will eventually on power windows. The pieces of cheap plastic used in these areas should be a liability for the manufacturer and they should have been forced to recall these vehicles for this constant repeat, year after year manufacturing of a defective part not intentioned to last.",2.0
"First of all, I want to say that up until this last purchase, I have been a loyal Chrysler customer since the 60's and have purchased about 10 of their vehicles including this 2011 Jeep. My wife and I traded our 2001 Durango 4x4 for the Jeep to be able to continue occasionally exploring back country areas in the Carolinas and Tennessee with the option of a removable soft top. Everybody knows that Jeeps are supposed to be ""Trail Rated"", yet they sell a vehicle that if used off road (just gravel roads) that it will burn up the transmission due to excessive fluid heat. If we did extreme off-roading (mud bogging or rock climbing) like you see Jeeps doing on TV, I might accept having to install additional equipment. 
      I'm told by Jeep Customer Service that if I want to use my vehicle this way, I have to pay for installation of an additional transmission cooler. Why didn't the ""Engineers"" incorporate that into the vehicle in the first place? I understand they reconfigured the standard cooler into the A/C condenser vs. the Radiator. Did they ""Trail Test it""? Are they willing to lose loyal customers over a couple hundred dollar part? They do install the factory cooler if you get the tow package, but I didn't plan to tow anything with my Jeep so it didn't concern me that the one I bought wasn't equipped with this package. Since I've dealt with this particular dealership for over 20 years, I've called and asked for the owner to respond by phone to see if he is more honorable than Chrysler.",1.0

"I bought my 2013 Jeep Patriot about 5 months ago. I loved it up until about 10K miles when I first started having problems. It has the CVT style transmission in it, and has now overheated and left me on the side of the road 4 times now. This latest time I sat on the side of the road for 21/2 hours in a remote area where I had no cell service. I have determined that it happens just about every time the temp is over 90 degrees outside - happens frequently in southern Louisiana and I have sustained between 70-75 miles an hour for more than 1 hour - I commute 1-1/2 hours each way as I live in Mississippi, and the majority of the highway speeds between here and there are 70 mph. I have been fighting with Chrysler for almost 2 months now. I was ecstatic when I got a call from corporate last Friday telling me they would be happy to buy back OR trade-in my vehicle. Now the corporate guy here is telling me they absolutely will not buy-back my vehicle, they will only trade.

No one will rebuild it due to the cost of tools and parts, so a new transmission from Jeep is the only solution. Chrysler basically told me to go away, as they had no intention of helping me with the problem. Whatever happened to that legendary Jeep that was bomb-proof and ran forever?

"I bought my 2004 Jeep Liberty almost 2 years ago. Aside from the constant light show on the dash, I loved the car! I started losing power when accelerating, at first occasionally but becoming more frequent over a month. I took it to my regular mechanic a couple of times but they couldn't find the problem. I ended up losing power completely and had it towed to Jeep dealership. First, I was told the water pump was loose and ""shook things up"". I needed a new one. They also did an ""injector service""(?). Tech drove it thinking it was fixed but he suddenly realized the car was a hazard when it all but stopped on the highway. 
      We are now @ $800 and climbing! A few hours later, he discovers a problem with a cylinder head. Here's the catch. They told me it was cracked and needed replaced but told my extended warranty co. it was warped. So when talking to warranty co., they would say warped but dealership would say cracked when talking to them! Who do I believe, the warranty co. or the supposedly trained tech that knows these things? Of course I believe the tech and tell them it needs done whether the warranty covers it or not. Aside from the fact that the service manager lied to me several times stating he was on the phone constantly with warranty co., he lied when telling me it was cracked! Warranty won't pay stating it was not a necessary replacement! It WAS warped and could have been machined down at a much lower cost! So after my Liberty being at dealership for 3 weeks (which I still can't figure out), I get to pick it up tomorrow! At last count, the total was almost $3400! That doesn't include the rental I needed! Always had VWs, then went to Subarus. With my business, I need 4 WD, though, which is why I went to Jeep. Never again!

"I bought my Jeep Patriot new off the lot. In fact I bought one that wasn't even on the lot. They had to ship it in from up country. I fell in love with the look and feel of it as soon I saw it. I've put 90,000 km. on it which is a little more than normal and I haven't had one bad experience with it yet. As long as you don't count going to the dealership for maintenance. But I solved that too. I just do it myself now. I obviously can't do everything myself but I do the majority. I've always wanted a Jeep, but could never afford the $35k price tag. That is until they made the Patriot. It's still the same old Jeep style and attitude but with a little more road etiquette behind it.

This has been an ongoing and constant problem. Since our daughter was at college far away we had to make the decision to have 3 of the windows permanently shut because even when Jeep did fix the windows they just broke again shortly after.

"We have a 2007 Jeep Commander with the lifetime, unlimited mile, unlimited time warranty from Jeep (Chrysler). For the past year, it has stalled repeatedly without warning. It just dies while going down the road which of course results in a loss of all power assist for steering and braking leaving the driver to muscle it out of traffic. It will restart but only after putting it in Park and turning the key completely to the off position and then restarting. It has been to the dealership multiple times, for a total time in the shop for a total time of about two months during the past year and they have yet to diagnose, much less, fix the problem despite getting Jeep engineers involved. We got the run-around from Jeep who eventually dropped the case and said we could start over with a new complaint.

"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Patriot in August 2011. I like my Jeep, but the problem I am encountering with the CVT Transmission is frustrating and concerning. In less than a year of having my Jeep, I began to notice a whining noise and the RPM getting stuck as if the transmission was not shifting. When I took it into my dealer’s service department, they said they couldn't find anything wrong. The assistant service manager suggested it was the wind I was hearing. A couple of months later, the same issues were happening regularly, but now the transmission temperature warning light came on. I again took it to the dealership. This time, I was again told they checked it out, couldn't find anything wrong, and they said they couldn't diagnose it unless the light was on.
      The next time the issue occurred, I was traveling to visit my parents 45 minutes away. The temperature warning light came on about 40 minutes into the drive. Once I got to my parents house, I decided to take it to the Jeep Dealership there. Unfortunately, when I started the Jeep, the light was off, making the trip to the out of town dealership pointless. In the last two months, the same issues have occurred, but on two occasions, my Jeep went into LIM (limp in mode), which forcibly slowed the vehicle down and required me to pull over on the Interstate for the transmission to cool down. After the first time it went into LIM, I called Jeep Customer Service to see what suggestions they had. The customer service representative with Jeep was nice, advised they had never heard of this problem, and instructed me to follow up the dealership.Before making yet another appointment with the dealership, I decided to do some general research on CVT Transmission in Jeep. I was totally surprised to see consumer comments of the exact same issues, especially after the Jeep representative said Jeep hadn't heard of this problem. One of these reviews suggested recording the issue. Within a week, it happened again! This time I recorded the noise, the temperature warning light coming on, and having to pull over. I took the video to the dealership. This time, the same assistant manager said, ""Every Jeep with CVT Transmission has that issue.""I asked about switching out the transmission. He advised there isn't a way to convert the transmission. He also said Jeep hasn't released a fix yet. So, my not even two year old Jeep, which is still under the manufacturer warranty, is defective with no fix for the issue. In the mean time, I can't drive my Jeep out of town and feel unsafe driving it. To top it all off, the CVT Transmission was a $1,000 upgrade! I feel like I have no options, but to retain an attorney and file a complaint under my state’s lemon law and the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act.",2.0

"I needed a RHD Jeep. I went to TN to get one asap. I had 2 to choose from that were new. Since they had black interior, I wanted the one with the tinted windows. I did not like the large mud tires on it and said so about 5 times. He did not want to change the tires; he said he would have to spend $300 to recalibrate them to 16"" tires. So, I paid more for the ""better"" tires as he stated. I found out that the tires slung rocks onto all 4 hinges and beat the paint off. They sold me $10 touch up paint with $6 shipping and handling. I bought mud flaps. This stopped the 2 top hinges from much more damage.
      Now I have ordered Mopar running boards in hopes of stopping more damage to the lower hinges before I touch up the paint. It costs $315. They offered to sell me one for $615 with installation. I hope my husband can install them. I feel this is a design flaw. I told both Jeep Corp. and the salesman that. Neither of them agreed. Now I have noticed that when I drive by the mile markers on the interstate, 3 miles measures 2.7, 4 miles measures 3.6 on the Jeep, and 5 miles measures 4.5, so I estimate if I go 10 miles only 9 miles will show up on the Jeep.",1.0

"I would like to inform you about problems with my 2010 jeep. It only has 40000 mi. on it. First of all, I purchased the extended warranty with $100 deductible. Nov. 2012 was the first prob. - a recall for a guard that could collect debris and catch fire. Chrysler fixed that prob. - I applaud them for that. The next prob. was when driving down the road, the dash lights and ABS ESP skid control lights came on also lost cruise control. The extended warranty fixed that with $100 deductible. That was fine. In March 2013, it was the same thing - dash lights acted up the same as it did in November but they say it is not the same thing. This time, they say it is corded wires that could cause fire. Okay, this may be true although how it is not related to the module that caused the same lights to light up and have same exact affect as before, I do not understand. This cost me another $100. 
      We have been with Chrysler products since 1969 but yet to buy one without problems. I am getting fed up! I guess the joke is on me for staying loyal and true so long with Chrysler. My wife worked for Chrysler for 33 yrs and Chrysler provided us with a living so I felt it only fair to buy their products. It's not so much now that we are on a fixed income. Whatever the problems which I don't understand - same light, same exact problem but they say it is not the same. If more problems happen, I will just paint ""lemon"" on the jeep and drive it around like that. Anyone that stops and asks questions, I will explain the ""service"" that I got.

"I purchased 3 new 2005 Liberty from 2 different dealers at the same time. As the single owners and used in our business, they are on the road 24/7 and are now at 200,000-250,000 miles. From day one, we have complained to the local dealer to no avail, who blew it off and never made any reports. When filling the tanks with gas on each Liberty, they spill over every time before the gas hose nozzle shuts off. It does not matter what gas station you go to. They all do the same spill over down the side of the car and onto the rear left wheels.
      The issue is none of our other cars do that. Fire is a real danger each time. We have to guess at about how much to fill the tank so it does not come up the next so fast before the pump can shut off. We operate several other cars at the time and have no problems with the auto shut off. We perceive the gas tank neck is too short or fills too fast trigger the shut off at the pump. There must be a design defect that spills gas over the fender about a pint each time you try to fill the tank at the full level. All 3 Jeeps do the same scenario. It's a 2005 design defect. A real safety hazard exists.",5.0
"We purchased a 2007 Jeep Commander less than a year ago. Within the last few months, every light on the dashboard has flashed on and off. When the heat is on, the heat will totally shut off. And now, the widows act like they don't want to roll down and the back door doesn't unlock all the time. We have taken it to the Jeep dealership and paid to find out what was wrong with it. We were told that they didn't know why and they can't find anything wrong with it. So we paid to be told that there's nothing wrong with it and the Jeep is still doing this. Please respond and help me as to what to do with this Jeep. Thank you.",1.0
"2007 Jeep Patriot - The engine will not go over 2,000 rpm. I've tried everything. This vehicle sucks!",1.0
"I recently purchased a used 2007 Jeep Commander with a 5.7L HEMI engine. Before I bought the Jeep, I took it to a Jeep dealership and paid $150 to have a full inspection done. They passed the Jeep so I bought it two weeks ago. In the last two weeks, the Jeep has stalled three times whilst in motion! Last night, it stalled going 75mph on the freeway with kids in the car! This is just not safe! I called the NHTSA and they opened a case for me, but that's all they did for me. 
      I called Jeep Customer Care, and they just told me I need to take it to a dealer and pay to have them diagnose it. I said, ""I just paid $150 for that."" But no, they want me to pay a new fee for a new test. If you look online, this is obviously a very dangerous and very common problem with Jeep Commanders. (I wish I knew before I bought it.) How can Jeep get away with not recalling all of them? How can only certain years be eligible for recall? This is very unsafe. What will it take before Jeep takes action? A death? I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do.",1.0
"My wife was driving our 2010 Jeep Liberty and pulled out from a red light. The Jeep would not stop accelerating and she was going 60mph in a 25mph. She was pushing the brake with one foot and holding the gas pedal up with the other foot to try to get it to stop. It wouldn't stop until she put it in neutral. The brake should override the gas pedal but didn't. This Jeep had the APP sensor replaced due to defect 11 months ago and after being towed to dealership, I was told it was the floor mat that came with the vehicle from the dealership. It was towed back to our home where it still sits undriven. I can't believe after two incidents they act as if we are making this up. There seems to be issues with Jeep's drive by wire system and the APP sensor is an issue. Why not leave the old cable system alone? It worked fine for 50+ years.",1.0
"On August 29, 2012, I brought my 2010 Jeep Liberty (26k miles) to DarCars Jeep in Rockville, Maryland because my Sky Slider would not close. My Liberty was in the shop for 80, yes, eighty days! The shop replaced the Sky Slider two times, Jeep engineers flew out from Detroit, and then the manufacturer of the Sky Slider built a new one on the factory floor. Yay, it appears to work but I am selling it, I refuse to own a car from a dealership that cannot stand behind their product. Not only has Chrysler Jeep refused to take ownership of the defective Sky Slider they are refusing to cover the 77 days I had a rental. So, I pay a monthly car loan for a car I cannot drive then have to pay $2k in rental fees on top of it.
      I have written letters to Customer Relations (following the warranty guidelines for complaints) only to be told they were transferring my problem to another department. I still haven't heard from anyone at Chrysler Jeep. This is my second Jeep - my last Jeep. Jeep has refused to stand behind their product. Jeep's dealership (the face of Jeep to the public) continuously ignored me during the 80 days my car was there. I would have to call three to four times a day to find out the status of my Jeep. When I asked if they could provide me a contact at Chrysler Jeep they said they would handle everything. Who is going to handle my $2k in rental? Single Moms, don't buy a Jeep. Get a car/truck/SUV from a company that actually works for their customer and stands behind their product because if it was up to Jeep I wouldn't have gotten to work every day, my kids to school and their activities.",1.0

After the sun was up, I looked at what I could and called Eric, my salesman. He told me to bring it back to be checked over. I drove the vehicle back into the dealership and dropped it off on Saturday, October 27 (less than 24 hours after purchase). After numerous phone calls, I was informed that they would not warrant the vehicle, stating I was doing burnouts or something and ruined the transmission (Matt).

"I have had my Jeep Wrangler Sport Unlimited 4-door since September 7, 2012. The first heavy rain we had here in San Antonio, Texas left the driver side floor with a small puddle of water. The next screwed up thing that happened was the zipper broke on the rear window on the driver's side. I took in the Jeep to get the leak fixed; it still leaks. I contacted the dealership (Ancira Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in San Antonio, Texas) and found out that the service department has to find someone to re-sew the zipper. They have to find someone who will do this within the price Chrysler gave them. I paid a lot of money for this Jeep and the last I want is to have my zipper sewn back on! That's **! I want my window fixed correctly! And if the whole top has to be replaced, then replace it! It's your screw up and you need to fix your screw up and if it's going to cost you, too bad!

"Pre mature wear of rear brakes 2010 Jeep Renegade  - I came in for my oil change. I have 12000 miles. They came and told me my rear brakes where worn down and I needed a brake job for $400. I had it done and got on the phone to Chrysler to file a complaint. The rear brakes should outlast the front by 3 times. The fronts are ok. I see many others with the same problems but on 2010 & 2009 vans. They agreed they should have not worn out and sent me a check for the repair done. They could not assure they would not wear out again in 12000 miles or less. The service manager said a lot of them have the same problem. I think it is a real safety concern. 
      I went to a speed shop and they told me it happens often to Chrysler products as the brake system has a poor design and cannot handle the weight of the 2009 & 2010. He told me next time to replace their rotors with double cross drilled rotors and that solved the problem for others. I think this Jeep is unsafe now because of the bad brake wear down and all they can do is issue a refund instead of solving the real problem. Now I have to worry about brake safety and have a pair of rotors waiting for the next time they wear out in less than 12000 miles. I hope others with the same problem will report it to Chrysler so they can make changes and resolve the problem that many are having with premature brake and rotor wear.",2.0
"I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty Limited which I purchased new. It has always been garage kept and never abused. At 77,000 miles, the rear differential needs to be overhauled according to North Tampa Jeep dealership. I filed a complaint and was given a case number by a lady named Jan at the Jeep Consumer Affairs Corp. I took my Jeep for a diagnosis at the aforementioned dealership, which cost me $104 out of pocket at the suggestion of Jan.
      Jan contacts me a day later and tells me Jeep will not cover the $2,300 repair because that is normal wear and tear. I asked Jan how many rear differentials go out at 77,000 miles and she could not answer me. My Jeep is not a 4-wheel drive nor have I towed anything with my Jeep. What happen to ""Jeep Tough.” It's wrong that Jeep won't cover the repairs - no, they will cover my out of pocket the diagnosis for $104.This is not my first new Jeep, but it will be my last Jeep. Jeep will not stand behind their vehicles in or out of warranty. This is very rare that the differential just happen to be out in my Jeep. Jan apparently has no supervisor above her. Her number is **. Voice your opinion on my behalf if you think Jeep was not fair with my complaint. Thank you.",1.0

We would have the vehicle serviced and traded up and purchase a new vehicle. The trust in your car products and materials has been irretrievably shattered. I purchased a brand new 1996 Chrysler Sebring which had consistent problems, traded up, purchased a brand new 1998 Chrysler Concorde that had transmission locked up, paid the car off and purchased a 2003 fully loaded Jeep Liberty.

This has been happening randomly since the first incident. I removed the floor mats to make sure that was not the issue. The dealership was able to duplicate the problem on their first try. This is not covered under the ext. mfg. warranty as it is considered ""an accessory"" (yes, I quote) even though it is listed as ""Miscellaneous Electrical System Repair"" on the dealership's service order. They want $385 to fix this issue. Chrysler Customer Care said ""due to your car's status, and you being the 2nd owner, there's nothing we can do.""

"I purchased a 2010 Jeep Compass in April 27, 2012 with 27,000 miles at the time of purchase. I fell in love with the car. I asked the GM for a Carfax. I did not get the Carfax until after I purchased the car. After I purchased the car, the next day, when I drove the car home, the gas gauge was not working. I called the GM, I took the car back, put it in the shop for a week, then the gas gauge was fixed. After that, the engine light came on, which they fixed. Three weeks later, it was back in the shop as there was a knocking under the car and the engine light came back on.
      When I picked up the car, they said that they had to replace the sign section. On June 12, the car was back in the shop as it was still having the knocking noise under the car. I reminded the supervisor of the noise and he said that he did not hear anything. On July 4 through July 30, Don Jackson had my Jeep for 30 days because the air went out. When I received my car back on July 30, the knocking noise was still there. The GM informed me that the car isn't new.I took my car to Don Jackson Jeep on September 17, 2012.

"While driving on vacation, on the 2nd day, my 2008 Jeep at 41,138 gave out on the transmission. I had to stop in MS State for repairs costing $3,699.13+135.60 car rental. Upon returning home, I called Chrysler who is willing to pay only $1,500 with no explanation or were concerned as to why the Jeep did what it did. I have been at this since August 14. Today, I am told the check for $1,500 is on the way but I have asked them to reopen the case as I am still not satisfied nor was I given any reasons except that the Jeep loaner has any warranties. It seems the Jeep had three years, 36,000 and no more. My question was whatever happened to power train warranty of 80,000/100,000?
      I find Chrysler staff incompetent to do their job in dealing with their customer and has no lack of concern over this early transmission issue with the Jeep. Mind you, they acknowledged it is an early problem but because they feel there is no warranty with the car, they were not going to further review why the transmission failed. They never called the dealership where it was repaired to this day. I have reported them to the TX AG and NHTSA/DOT and will continue to post this issue on any website that will alert any consumers on this automaker. Now that the case has been reopened, I will wait and see what the outcome will be the second time around. There was a day when I asked for the Chrysler corporation's phone number. The operator gave me to their roadside assistant line.I am very angry and very frustrated at the way I have been treated. By the way, they not only asked me for the repair bill. They had the gall to ask me for my credit card statement to show that I really did pay for the repairs of $3,699.13. How do you like that for treatment by Chrysler Customer Care?

This is after being there for 4 hours. 2 days later I have the same issue. I took it back to the shop and 6 hours later I am told they still are not sure why it is happening after they put 25-plus miles on it test driving it and said they rotated the tires and need to see if I am having a control module issue or a TPMS issue. 
      They said to bring it back if it happens again. Two days later, it happened again and so today I dropped it off at about 9 am. At around 4 pm, I get a phone call that they need to keep it overnight and they will set me up with a rental. They cannot find the control module they are looking for. It’s not where the book says it is. Now, I am really aggravated. I bought a brand new vehicle so I would not have these problems and yet in 3 weeks they have had the vehicle 3 different times and now overnight! I’m calling to complain to Jeep.

"Jeep does not stand by their product! Sorry everyone for my rant, but I have to go off about Jeep customer service and how awful they are! We have had a Jeep Liberty for 6 years which we bought brand new.

      Jeep customer service’s response to every single one of these claims (with the exception of the windows since that is something every 2006 Liberty is experiencing) is ""Not our problem!"" All I asked them to do is take their piece of crap car back! Would they do it? Nope, it’s not their problem. They said you can try to get out of under the car at your own discretion.

"The problem began initially in 4/2010 when the vehicle had 53,165 miles on it and the engine would idle roughly, the ESP/BAS indicator would come on, the check engine light would come on, and the traction assist indicator would all come on at the same time. As soon as all the indicators would light, the car would handle poorly, not shift properly, and at times simply stall out on the highway. I brought the car to my local Jeep dealership and upon inspection, they found that the intake manifold had melted and come apart; thus, it needed to be replaced at a cost of $485, which was fine considering the car overall had not given me many major problems. So, I proceeded to have the work done. 
      A couple of weeks ago, the same problems began happening again (the engine would idle roughly, the ESP/BAS indicator would come on, the check engine light would come on, and the traction assist indicator would all come on at the same time), so I brought the car back to the same dealership. Upon inspection, they found that once again, the intake manifold had melted and come apart, thus it needed to be replaced at a cost this time of $685. Mind you, the car now has 96,057 miles. My main concern is that the intake manifold lasted only 42,901 miles and had to be replaced once again. I voiced my concerns to my service advisor and he stated that the first time the upper manifold had gone bad and that this time the lower manifold had gone bad. That may very well be the case but if you look at the invoices, the part numbers are exactly the same (53032774AA). I understand that the dealership can only do so much, so I am now appealing to you as it seems that the intake manifold for my 2006 Jeep Commander has a factory defect as it literally melts and begins to come apart especially with the extremely hot weather in South Florida every 40,000 miles or so.I wrote a letter to Chrysler and received an email asking me to call their customer assistance center. I called and was basically told that there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager and Daniel refused to let me do so saying that he had the final decision on my claim.

So we forked out $200 to get it changed. Did that change the problem? No. It started up again. I took it down the road and it stalled out again. So with this going on, I did some digging on the internet and found others were having these issues.
      A lot were saying that the PCM module is bad. So I called Jeep to find out about a recall on the PCM module. They said I had to take it to one of their service places to get verification that this was the issue. They couldn't get it to start and said I needed to change an SKIM module ($375.00). It's more out-of-pocket. The reason the SKIM module got burned out, by what the mechanic said, was because of the power control module. So now that 1 month or so has passed and my daughter has a heart condition and my mother is 3 hours away having quadruple bypass surgery, I don't have a vehicle to get there and be with her. And I finally got a response from Jeep Daimler Chrysler that it isn't under warranty to be fixed. Even though it's their malfunctioning part that was put on the vehicle when made, they don't want to be accountable for it. So either we pay the $800.00 for the PCM module or I don't have a reliable safe-driving vehicle. How can manufacturers get away with this?",2.0
"I purchased a 2012 Jeep Patriot Latitude in February 2012. I immediately noticed problems with the wiper blades coming on, dash lights began to dim, radio light display unable to see. I set a service appointment with dealer purchased from. Their review of problem was no problem could be located, even after I typed a detailed list of the items mentioned. Well, here we go again. I set the service appointment again, as the problems have gotten worse, now the AC will not cool and with the wiper, dash lights, radio display are still not working properly. So, I will see what the service department says tomorrow. Unfortunately, I paid cash for the thing, and what a mistake that was. I am 76 year old, gray-headed female; tell me out there, will I need an attorney to get the dealership to stand behind the warranty? Has anyone else had this type of electrical problems with their new 2012 Jeep Patriot?",2.0
"Was my Jeep painted at 4:45pm on a Friday? And the BBB is useless - First said, I love my Jeep and want no other car. This complaint is solely on shoddy workmanship and inspection practices. At purchase, I did notice bumpy paint on the door hinges and on one hood hinge, I was not concerned at time; I was excited to get my Jeep. My boyfriend made the comment that I need to get it looked at because he thought these were air bubbles and would eventually begin to flake. Well, one of them finally flaked; I took it to the dealer. I had seen a Jeep just like mine the week before with the same paint flaws. It happened to be the same color as my Jeep so I thought it was a defect in that particular paint color. Well, the dealer said it was rust and they have seen several vehicles in multiple colors with this same issue. They said the factory painted over rust, rust?! 
      The dealer took photos and submitted them to corporate with estimates and was shot down each time. At one time I asked my contact, “Since I brought my Jeep in at just fewer than 50K miles, you think they (corporate) may be stalling for me to hit the 50K?” He said it does make it harder to get things done “after the 36,000” is up, but we will see. Well, I guess since it is my fault that the paint finally flaked after 36,000 miles, the Chrysler Corporation does not feel they are in need of fixing something that should not have left their factory floor in the first place. I even shelled out $3K+ for the lifetime service and power train warranties, still nothing. No wonder people hate buying American goods. Our eyes for detail stink especially if you get an inspector at 4:50pm on a Friday reviewing what is about to be shipped to a sales floor. I will be submitting this complaint to the BBB, and various consumer watchdogs. Thanks for your time in reading this. The above letter is what I e-mailed to Chrysler yesterday and it was probably scoffed at because as I contacted the BBB today, via my phone, I got this automated message that told me that Jeep was ""one"" of the dealers that did not participate in the BBB’s Auto Line Program and that I should consult my owner’s manual or press 1 for the directory of the auto service manufactures, **? Companies can choose if they want to receive BBB complaints or not? I thought the BBB was there to help resolve the issues and instead it is directing me back to the corporation that does not want to resolve the product defect in the first place? Attorneys, possible class action suit as I have seen and heard of other Jeeps with this issue?",1.0
"On or about May 16, 2012, I began experiencing a horrible ""mold"" type odor emitting from my AC unit of our 2012 Jeep Liberty. On May 21, 2012, I brought our 2012 Jeep Liberty to the service department of the Faricy Boys Jeep Dealer in Colorado Springs, CO. They kept the vehicle for two days, diagnosed the problem and replaced the evaporator core. I picked up the Jeep and immediately detected a rubber type odor. I contacted the service adviser and was informed that the odor was the coating on the new evaporator core and would disappear in a couple of days.
      On June 1, 2012, while driving to work, I experienced the same odor and again returned the Jeep. I spoke with the service manager, who agreed the moldy odor still exists. He suggested possibly misting the vehicle to get rid of the smell. This was unacceptable and would only mask the cause. The Jeep was left at the dealership again with a request for a loaner vehicle. The service manager informed me that it was not their policy to provide loaner vehicles. We are making monthly payments of a new vehicle purchased by us to provide necessary transportation. We now do not have use of the vehicle due to a defective AC systems or component and are required to submit to the policies of the Jeep dealership. Jeep engineers have been contacted by the mechanic and have suggested contaminated antifreeze. This Jeep is an absolute lemon and we want it returned to the dealership.",2.0
"Remote Start for Our Jeep Wrangler - We have had so much grief with the Remote Start for our Jeep. It was installed and taken out several times because when we engage it, all the dashboard lights go on, the engine races, we are able to take the key out and it is still running. We step on the brake as we were told to do and still all dashboard lights are on and the engine is on and revving! After the car finally shuts off, the check engine light stays on. 
      I spoke to Joe from Finance to see if we could have our money back since Howie took the Remote Start out and the Jeep was working fine with no problems. Joe was very rude and condescending to me. He insisted that we should have never had it taken out and must have it installed again. My wife called Joe on the phone that same day and he was just as rude and condescending to her. Joe told her that this was not a piece of candy we could return to the candy store two months later. So, at Joe's insistence, Aaron had Howie reinstall the Remote Start. Since then, we have had the same troubles again! Today we videotaped it to show them this was not a lie or something out of our imagination. Mr Manfredi, we bought 2 cars this year, a Dodge Avenger and the Jeep (February and March), both with Remote Starters. My Avenger's remote starter works perfectly. The Jeep has been a nightmare that seems to have no end. Supposedly, Tony is now working on it. Why can't we have it removed? We are moving to Florida in mid-June and will be driving the Jeep down. We are afraid of what might happen! Please. Please help us solve this craziness. I am sorry to have to come to you, but we are not getting any satisfaction from anyone else. The cars are under my wife's name. Aaron has been a gem through all of this but says his hands are tied when it comes to solving this. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take a look at this and get back to us. I hope I downloaded the video right. If not, I have it on my cell phone.",1.0
"The water pump on my 2009 Jeep Liberty went bad at 35,000 miles. It is 2 weeks out of warranty and they will not fix it. To top it off, when the case manager said that they will not approve the fix, she would also not let me speak with her supervisor or anyone else. Apparently, they let their lower level case managers make the final decision. A water pump should not go bad for 150,000 miles on today's vehicles. I am starting my anti-Chrysler/Jeep campaign today. I will never buy one again. It is a shame that this is what American car companies have come to. They can't design and make equipment that last past 35,000 miles without breaking.",1.0
"We purchased our 2007 Jeep Commander with less than 30,000 miles and the car only had one owner. Several months after purchasing the car, we had several instances where the car would just shut off. We took it to a local Jeep dealership a couple of times and they said they could not find anything wrong. Six months after we bought the car, it left me stranded in December at 10 pm on a major highway. I had to have it towed. The water pump went out. I was able to pull over as soon as the engine light came on. We had the repair done, but the car always had a slight vibration and just did not seem to have the power it once had.
      We took it to the dealer three times after that. The first time, they said they could not find anything wrong. The second time they adjusted something and the engine light, that had come on, went off. They said everything was okay. After two days, the engine light came on again. We took it back and they said one of the coils was bad, so we replaced it. Two weeks later, I left work and the car was vibrating so hard when I started it. I thought the engine was going to blow right there. I turned the car off and had it towed to the dealership on 2/17/12 and as of 5/22/12, it is still there. They replaced the engine and the new engine overheated due to a defective part. We were advised a new part was ordered, but we are still waiting.We went to get the VIN off of the car about a week ago to turn off our satellite radio since we were not getting to use it and a rat had built a nest in the dashboard and chewed our owner's manual. They have had our car for almost 3 and 1/2 months. We have been dealing with Chrysler's customer care along with the dealership, but that has been a disappointment at best. They give us dates of when the part will arrive after we call, but they don't follow up on anything. If we don't call, we get no information. I have owned a Ford Escort that I bought new and drove it for 13 years until someone hit it and it could not be repaired. I have a 2000 Honda CRV that I bought new and after all these years, I am just now having to repair the air conditioner and some other minor things due to wear and tear over the years (the Honda now has 180,000 miles).I have bought several other used cars which I paid only a few thousand for and have never really had any problems with them. This is my first experience with a Chrysler product and I will never purchase another Chrysler again. After doing some research, I now see the issue with the car shutting off was a known issue with a module and they knew it all along and lied to us about it rather than trying to fix it. They might look good from the outside, but the craftsmanship and the service were terrible.",1.0
"I have a 2012 Jeep Rubicon that is sitting under a tarp at the dealership I purchased it from, waiting for a replacement cylinder head. Apparently, this is a known issue to Chrysler and instead of contacting owners to replace the heads, they are riding it out to see who all complains about it. Well, mine has cracked and two weeks later still no cylinder head. I opened a case with Chrysler Jeep customer care and have a case number. Finally, I talked to my case manager after four days of calling and he tells me it will be another week before the dealership even gets the new one and refuses to escalate my complaint higher. I have a $38,000 vehicle and I can't drive it. What am I driving? A Ford Focus. Really? Not even comparable. Beyond angry.",1.0
"I was pulling out of a parking lot onto a busy highway, when my 2008 Jeep Wrangler started honking and the lights started flashing. It stalled for a few seconds, then I started driving again. I made it 1/2 block to the stop lights, at which time, it did it again and stalled completely. I was able to coast through the stop light and turn onto a side street, where it stopped in a very unsafe area. 
      I immediately called for help and couldn't even get to make my hazards go on. We have since had it towed to a dealership, and we are waiting to see what they come up with. 1 month ago, the stabilizer bar went, causing us to be thrown into oncoming traffic over in Detroit. We had that fixed (quite a cost) and found out this is also a common issue with these jeeps. From reading on the internet, both these things are common problems, but Jeep will not own up to these things. These trucks are horrible and unsafe! We bought ours new, and we have never gone 4x4ing or abused it in any way! We still owe 2 years of payments on this piece of junk, and we are afraid to drive it, because it is a death trap!",1.0
"I had top and bottom ball joints go bad on my 2003 Jeep liberty and the dealership in Slidell was going to replace them because there was a recall on them. Chrysler claims there was no recall. At first, they said I should have waited for the part to come in at the dealership in Slidell. The part never did come in and if my son wouldn't have changed the part, who was going to pay for the accident? Then they claim it was taken care of in 2006. If they would have changed them in 2006 which they didn't, don't you think six years is a very short life span for ball joints? Why does the government keep bailing these car companies out when they are cheating the American people? I am very unhappy about all the lies and I think they should pay for the job.",1.0

We couldn't wait for them or I would have had an accident. When I got hold of them at the corporate office, all they did was lie. They said that they were changed in 2006. Does anybody see anything wrong with that? Since when do the top and bottom ball joints go out in less than 6 years? They also said there wasn't a recall. They just won't own up to their mistakes.

This is my third Jeep, and have owned two Rams, so I consider myself a good Chrysler customer. Well to my surprise, my transmission is ready to let go. Two Chrysler dealers in my area said they have never seen anything like this before and told me to contact Chrysler Canada and they might be able to bend the rules since this is a very rare incident and that my Jeep is such in good shape. Well, they pretty much slammed the door in my face. They will not do anything for me. I was going to trade her in for a new one this summer. Well I can tell you my mind has been changed.

At first, I believed it was some fault of ours but after three 40,000 dollar cars and they all did the same thing, I decided to keep one and went to the dealership to pay and fix my own. They quoted me a price of $550.00 a piece, which is not fair as this is the third vehicle we have had to do this. I love these SUVs, but the doorknobs and the seat belts also will not hold up making it impossible to take all the kids at once. $330.00 a piece to fix the seat belts.

I had it towed to a Jeep dealer here in Salt Lake City, and I was told it would cost me $4600.00 to have it repaired. Now, I read on Consumers Report that the Jeep Liberty is a death trap.

"The Jeep was purchased in Utah where I have had nothing but problems from the beginning. It started with bad tire pressure sensor, then rear plastic window cracked, which is cracking again.

Then the complete clutch and clutch release bearing went bad at 20,000 miles, which started to make noise again two months later and is going out again. Then the A/C didn't work, half doors flex out a half inch while driving on the freeway. They said it is normal. Then the front end rattles, the tailgate rattles loud and the traction control goes off for no reason on dry pavement, which makes the gas pedal unresponsive. It happened five times, then it knocks and pings abnormally, burns a quart of oil every 3000 miles.

Then the zipper on the window doesn't work, stereo speakers make loud popping noise. Most of all these defects still are happening. The answer I got from traction control malfunction was ""life's a risk"". The answer I got for the front end noise was ""turn your radio up"".

"My husband and I purchased our ""Dream"" vehicle in 2009 and have had nothing but bad and dangerous experiences with the vehicle. It all started while driving on a very congested highway when the Jeep went over an uneven patch of road. It began to buck and lose control. We were shaken and scared, as my husband veered the vehicle to the right side of the highway. We made an appointment with our local dealer, and they found nothing wrong with the Jeep.

Months later, while driving yet again on the highway, the vehicle began to do the same thing--shake and convulse, and the brakes would not work properly. We have contacted Chrysler Corporation and have spoken to several employees who want us to continue taking the Jeep in for service, except one gentleman who basically told me to just deal with it! We believe Chrysler Corporation is very much aware of the problems with these vehicles and that they are just playing it off and ignoring the potential danger. We do not feel comfortable in trading this vehicle in and having someone else come after us and purchase this ""extremely dangerous"" vehicle.

"I financed a new 2007 Jeep Commander Sport. The first of many visits to the dealer was reinstalling the software. Then, we experienced on occasion, when all the gears on the panel lit up, and our truck wouldn't drive over 20 mph, which we recorded. I took it to the dealer, and never duplicated the error (software got updated). A couple of months later, the passenger speaker had a recall, and the dealer fixed it. A few months later, we noticed on cold days the idle would drop, as it was going to shut off. Also, on stops, the idle would go up, as my foot was on the break pedal. This got me worried. Once, a pedestrian walking in front of me thought I did it to scare them. I took it to the dealer. At this time, I knew the staff at Long Beach Chrysler Jeep personally, so they tried duplicating it. Of course, it wasn't. Months went by, everything was cool, I guess, then there was another recall on the side air bags. Before I go on, I forgot my wife was in involved in an accident, as she was leaving her parking spot. To get on the street, a driver clipped her tire, and pushed her forward six feet onto a parked Lexus. No airbags were deployed. They inspected something like the black box, and said she was traveling at a certain rate of speed to deploy. Whatever, my wife was at fault. The problem ended with the self idling after the last software upgrade.
      At 30,000 miles, I needed to service the transmission. I thought about taking it to a local shop. To my surprise, my truck didn't come equipped with a transmission dipstick. The dealer, or someone with the latest tool could only check it. At this time, I had moved to Bakersfield, so my choice was to take it to the local Jeep dealer. They noticed there was a leak on a seal. My warranty covered it, but had to pay a $200 deductible. It was smooth sailing, until my turning signaler started acting up in November. It was broken, so I had to replace it, and again, I had to pay a deductible.A month later, I noticed outside air coming in through the vents, but my fan cycle was off, and air was in recirculating mode, so no air should have been noticed. I took it in, in January 2012, to see if there was a recall, or maybe something got disconnected. The Bakersfield Jeep dealer would charge a diagnostic fee, and if the part was covered in warranty, they would waive it. They found the actuator needs to be replaced, and it's not covered by my warranty. They gave me a discounted quote for $850, but got me for my diagnostic fee. I knew it was a problem with the outside air coming in, so when I took it in, I told them it must be some kind of damper, that opens and closes like a door. Why couldn't the dealer tell me that only major AC components were covered, before they took my money. So now, my warranty is expiring, and I'm shopping for an extended warranty service outside the dealer. Since I have a pre-existing problem, a new warranty will not honor it. Unless it's another component that leads to that problem.Another issue I experienced about 2 years later after purchase, was my passenger mirror needed to be replaced. The long beach dealer fixed it. Prior to that, my gear shifter got stuck, and needed to be fixed. The dealer fixed it. Within the third year or so, I was living in the valley, and it gets hot. I turned the AC on, and a real foul muggy smell would come out of the vents. I took it to the dealer, and they had report that the condensate drain was plugged up. The dealer fixed it and even cleaned up my AC vents with some fancy spray. I'm finally going to be done paying it off in a few months, and have no plans of ever buying a Chrysler/Jeep vehicle. For what it's worth, now I think I'll have to buy an extended warranty elsewhere. I hope my issues get resolved with whatever service contract I purchase, and hope it's not the actuator that the dealer said was faulty. I'm not planning to get rid of it for now, I will drive it until years of newer warranties are expired.",2.0
"I write to you with deep dissatisfaction caused by my first impression of your service levels. I bought my car couple of months ago mid of December from your show room in Riyadh Dabbab Street. The first time I drove it, I noticed that the Forward Collision Warning was indicating that its not functioning in the computer screen located in the dashboard. The sales representative informed me that this might be a small programming issue that could be solved by visiting the servicing center in Khurais Street. During the first week of driving the car, I found out that the car also flags unnecessary breaking alarms on the computer screen. Also, the cruise control function gets disengaged within seconds of operation and driving.
      I visited your servicing center and a check was made where they found there is a defect in couple of parts that needed to be changed for the Radar and the Cruise Control functions to work. I was informed that the parts will be requested and in two weeks the parts will arrive and I will be contacted to bring my car to replace the parts and fix those two issues for both functions to operate.The fact that this was my first experience with a new car that had been bought and is considered the top of the Jeep Brand line was very disappointing. Usually, manufacturing defects surface within the first thousands of kilometers drive. In my case, it was the first seconds of driving the car out of the show room. However it gets worse...Although I was promised that I will receive a call in two weeks time, which never happened, I visited the servicing center for the second time approximately two weeks after not getting any update or the promised call. I was told that there is another part that still pending and needs to be ordered. I was requested to wait for another month. I expressed my dissatisfaction, knowing that such type of parts would not need more than two weeks to be ordered from the factory in the US if needed . I also suggested to the service manager to use DHL services and charge me the delivery fees if it's not within the UMC policy to request parts through international couriers. Two weeks is usually the normal experience with my other car parts ordering process where unavailable parts in the region would take maximum 15 days to be ordered from the factory. I was told that I could take my car back home and I will be called again when the second part will arrive. From my previous experience and the bad first impression I encountered, I refused and preferred leaving it to be serviced for other issues believing that the main old issue will be sorted as per my expectation.Two weeks now and my car still held with your servicing center without any update from your side. Today, I called your servicing center following up on the issues raised and again, I could not get any expectation or feedback as when the parts will arrive, replaced and my car can be delivered as I was expecting (fully functional) when I first bought it.I would kindly request you to review the circumstances of this compliant and find a reasonable solution that will insure a proper management of your customer's expectations is a key deliverable to promote the well known and respected Jeep Brand. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",1.0
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Patriot and the check engine was on.  I had it put into the purchase paper work that it need to be fixed upon my purchase.  I had my dad pull the code on it and it was a P2004 intake manifold stuck open.  
      I informed the dealer of the code and they said that they will get it fixed and they had to order the part.  The dealership had my Jeep for three days and when I got it back, the light was off but the next day, while driving home from work, the light came on again.  I again had my dad pull the code and he said P2004 intake manifold stuck open.  Upon further investigation of the engine, he also stated that there doesn't seem to have been any work done on the engine.  What can I do?  I cannot afford to put almost $1000 into a vehicle.  The dealership is being uncooperative as well.",2.0
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty brand new. It will be 5 yrs that I have had it in Dec. It has less than 60,000 miles on it and I have had so many problems with it. First off, the 1st yr was good. Then it just snowballed from there. A spring broke in the lifters; this was covered. Then my check engine light kept coming on. The car would stall. I was told it was an emissions problem. It cost nearly $500 to have it fixed. 
      Then the ABS light started coming on constantly. Starting the car up in the driveway, the ABS light would come on. Sitting still at a traffic light ,the ABS light would come on. I took it to the dealer to have it checked and told them exactly what I stated. I was told that they needed to know more. They didn't know why it was happening. Then this summer, my driver side window stopped working. I took it to the dealer and they told me, ""Oh, that's not covered. It's the window regulator, only the lifters are covered."" After fighting with Chrysler about this, they said if I paid 90 dollars, they would pay the rest. I did not get it right to the dealer. I come home one day and there is a message from Chrysler saying, ""Oh, that deal was only good for 30 days and you didn't get it done. so it's null and void.""At no time was I told there was a deadline on the deal. Yesterday, I went to move my car out of the drive so my husband can leave for work. As I put the car into park, there was a loud clicking noise. I went to turn the car off and the key didn't turn all the way and it's stuck in the ignition. I took it to the dealer and they tell me that the shifter cable is broken and ""no, it's not covered, it will cost me 330 dollars"". I bought a new car so I would not have the problems of a car ""nickel and dime-ing"" me all the time. Boy, did I get screwed. I have had better used cars that totally lasted a lot longer without breaking down.I am very angry that I have had to put all this money into this car. I really believe that this car has a lot of defects. I have read numerous complaints about people having problems with the windows, etc., yet nothing is being done. So what do I have to look forward to next? I just can't believe in the time that I have had this vehicle all that has gone wrong. I could maybe understand it if it were a lot older. I'm totally dissatisfied with Jeep and Chrysler for that matter. And it proves to me that the quality of the cars the are being putting out are way below standard. They say you pay for what you get. Well, I guess I pretty much paid for poor craftsmanship and a defective car.",1.0
There is a recall notice out there for those of you who have problems with your window regulator. My wife's sister had hers fail (2009 Jeep Liberty) and paid $450 to have it repaired. A recall notice was generated and she was paid for this repair. Check it out.,3.0
"Currently, new power train motor mount, car is stalling and stops. Chrysler changed my dealership. Antwerpen treated me poorly and sold a defective vehicle with rust and all. Currently, the car is at Tate in MD. All I'm asking for is an extended warranty. Many more parts have been changed. The trouble is that the dealership can't duplicate problems. They have to use on star. Even then, I  was told by Mr. ** that they can't duplicate problem. I have an extended history of service with the vehicle. It requires its own file box. I need assistance in order to obtain an extended warranty.",1.0
"While backing out of my usual parking space at the usual cautious pace, as I placed my foot on the brake, the Jeep (V8) suddenly chirped all four tires. Fortunately, I reacted by undoing what I just did, removed brake pressure (scary), then moved my foot left back onto the brake and stopped the vehicle. So, I've advised my wife to not drive the Jeep, and if any car suddenly accelerates, remove your foot and quickly replace it properly on the brake. Also, I advised her to slap the shifter into neutral and turn off the key. Remember, the Audi story years ago (we had one). The same situation happened. I got my foot partly on both the brake and accelerator and it chirped the front tires. In both cases when accelerating, there is less vacuum pressure due to the wide open throttle, so brake force is reduced, requiring many more pounds of force to stop. So, we need to remind our families that it's easy to do, and be ready to in due what you just did. By the way, now my Jeep lift gate is dented from car wash guys pushing the car from the wash line.",3.0
I have a 2011 Jeep Compass with 2.4 liter engine. The vehicle has 500 miles and we are only getting 7-10 miles/gallons in the city. I cannot get any assistance from the dealership. They just tell me to wait until summer and see if it improves. Anybody have some of the same problems?,2.0
"I just leased a 2012 Jeep Liberty. Jeep on their own website says that every radio system on the Jeep Liberty comes with Sirius XM radio and a 1-year subscription, as does the new car window sticker, and as did the salesman who leased me the vehicle. However, poking around all the channels on my new ""Sirius XM radio"", I find that there are channels missing. Upon deeper research, I find that I actually have a ""Sirius Select"" subscription, not a Sirius XM subscription as promised. And upon further checking I find that I cannot just upgrade my subscription on my own to get Sirius XM channels because Sirius XM requires a “different radio than is offered with the Jeep Liberty!”
      If Jeep had said, ""Our Sirius XM (the manufacturer) radios come with a free 1-year Sirius Select subscription,"" that would be one thing, but they did not. I have been on the phone with Sirius XM, and many times with the Jeep dealer and with Jeep corporate. Today the Jeep sales manager called me and basically said, ""Sorry but we are not liable for that."" The assigned Jeep case worker told me first that they would give me free oil changes. When I insisted they keep their word and give me Sirius XM radio as promised, she then came back and said they would cover half of the cost of the Sirius XM radio. If they aren't responsible, why would they do that? When I tried to nail the case manager down about exactly how much that is and if that included the subscription, she said she didn't know. Obviously she is going back and forth with the dealership, which is not owned by Jeep but is an independent dealer. I also looked into getting Sirius XM internet radio, but again that still does not have the XM stations I want, so I can't cover this on my own without spending hundreds. But I shouldn't have to do that anyway. The issue isn't just a few channels. The issue is that Jeep is not providing something that is promised and is listed on the sales receipt. I don't want to make a huge deal about this. All I want is what I was promised. How about it, Jeep?",1.0
"For the second time in less than 2 years my rear window regulator broke. First time it cost me $350.00. Now they want another $170.00 to fix it, plus it cost me $65.00 for them to tell me what was wrong with it. I told them to tape it up and forget it. I am not working at this time and cannot afford the company's incompetence. I cannot believe that with so many complaints on this that the company has not recalled this defective component in their vehicles. Am I angry? You bet. I am looking for a different vehicle today, forget them. I loved my vehicle but cannot afford this problem every time I turn around.",1.0

We were supposed to have it by January 24. After speaking to Florida I was told that they didn't know if any were going to be coming in because they didn’t have a supplier.

"My mom had purchased a brand new 2003 Jeep Liberty sport in 2003. Everything was good with the car for a while except it idled high and then the fan went out. When we had that replaced, the ABS light came on and really has never turned off. The mechanic had unplugged wires and messed with fuses, but it never was fixed. There also was a recall on the lower ball joints, which took forever for the dealership to send to us. Now here is the interesting part, we live in a remote area of Alaska and it does get cold. Last Wednesday, I went out and started the jeep and it ran about 10 minutes before we heard this loud boom in our house. I looked outside and the car had blown up and was on fire back by the gas tank. The car is a complete loss, the whole inside was burnt to hell, there was nothing left. The fire department said the case was an equipment malfunction. They think either the gas line or tank froze and then cracked or something. I have read online about the gas tank problems other Liberty owners have had and that is really scary. I am just thankful no one was in the car and no one was hurt.",1.0

"I own a 2006 Jeep Liberty that I purchased new. I had several problems with the window regulators breaking and the windows falling down or failing to roll back up. The first few times these were replaced under warranty. After my warranty expired, my back two windows broke and fell down. I called to find out what this would cost and was told about $400 per window. I did not have nearly $900 to shell out to have this fixed when there is an obvious problem with these windows in this model year. 
      Last year, I found out Jeep decided to extend the warranty on these windows for model years 2006-2007 for 7 years. I called my dealer to find out about this warranty and was asked for my Vin number, they ran the number and told me my car did not qualify as it was past the cut off month - mine built in March '06 and they said it was for anything after May '06 and later. The letter says nothing about this! They said I could have them fixed and pay for it and then try to get my money back from Chrysler Jeep. I am a single mother and don't have that kind of money to get these fixed for a problem that Jeep is very aware of! This is very unsafe as your car can easily be broken into if the window starts to fall. All someone has to do is push down, reach in and open the car. I currently have wedges stuck in between the glass and door to try and keep these up. It is ridiculous. I can't use my windows and I will never be able to sell this car or trade it in with this problem not fixed. The cost is too expensive that no one else will want to pay to have it done. I am stuck with this car that was poorly designed that Jeep is very aware of and now will do nothing about it.",1.0
"I have a 2008 Jeep Patriot and my car continues to stall. While driving down the highway with my baby, a 2-year old, the call stalled and I had to use the momentum from before hand to steer over to the emergency lane. Upset and shaken, I called to tell my fiance because all this began after having a routine oil change just four days earlier with only one day of driving in between.
      In either case, I'm in the emergency lane just moments before a possible rear ending. The car now parked and turned off. I waited five minutes before restarting it. As soon as the car was able (meaning it kept stalling within same day), I took it back to the dealership. They told me the oil is fine and that now my check engine light and oil indicator light is on. I'm baffled. It wasn't before. They asked me to pay them over $400 to diagnose and perform preventive services that weren't needed prior to them changing my oil.I left with intention of contacting corporate FTC (1-877-) and NHTSA (1-888-). To my distress, these events happened four more times before I made it home. My home is a five-minute drive from the dealer. I am petrified to drive it. I am so scared that if and when it happens again, I won't be able to get to safety before something horrific happens. As I read similar complaints to that of my own, I see that Jeep has made this a recall issue for Cherokees and Compass only and that is what baffles me.

"Let it be known that the life of an importer of Jeep Liberty CRDs to Canada is humiliated into a great deal of time wasting trouble. Dealers in my city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada don't like importers. They call us “curbers.” A bad word. The Chrysler service departments don't like the Liberty CRD. The latest problem is when I must go to my local dealer to get the daytime running lights activated. DRLs are mandatory to satisfy the Canadian Auto Registrar.
      Dealers charge $90 for the Canadian module and they charge $90 to activate the module, which looks like a relay that goes into the left hand side dash fuse box. The US module plugs right in beside the Canadian one and when the programming is finished you unplug the US relay module. (It buzzes if you leave it in). Today the dealer took my CRD into their shop. I signed the waiver and in a half hour I get a call that they cannot get their computer to get into the Liberty’s computer. This means no DRL and no to any updates. I got back into my CRD and noticed the air bag light was on. I tried plugging the US module back in and also tried disconnecting the battery for reset.Nothing works. Dodge City service department Saskatoon, SK is stating no responsibility and will not hook their computer up to my ECU unless I agree to at least $2,000 minimum work order.

The risks are huge to the safety of the vehicle occupants and others on the road should something fall out.The other thing that is very alarming is that everything is beginning to present itself at a similar time for the vehicles showing signs of the problem. Jeep claims it is due to plastic parts failing due to not enough use? This makes no sense. The rear window has no support and falls inside the window.

After doing some research (and holding it up with duct tape), I have found out that I cannot simply purchase the regulator slider that is faulty but I have to purchase an entire new motor and regulator with a new window since Jeep has redesigned said parts after finding out their previous design was faulty. I can aptly fix the problem myself but cannot purchase the single part because Jeep no longer allows selling it. This is absurd and a recall should definitely have been issued. I will never buy Chrysler again.",1.0
"My wife and I bought a 08 Commander three months ago.  When taking it to my mechanic to have an oil change performed, he saw a leak coming from the engine block.  I contacted Chrysler and was told to take it to a dealership to have them diagnose the issue to see if they could help cover it.  The dealership found a crankshaft seal leaking which I have replaced at the time, granted the vehicle only has 30,000 miles on it.  Chrysler informed me that they cannot cover it because they can’t tell if it was pre existing when we bought it or not.  
      I will definitely remember this when my 05 Ram and Jeep need to be replaced when I find a different make to buy.  They fail to realize that the main issue is that stuff is failing in the engine and transmissions of all their vehicles with low miles.  The US tax payers helped bail the auto industry out and they can’t help the people who purchase their vehicles by backing up what they sell.",1.0
"I bought a certified pre-owned 2007 Jeep Patriot with 17,000 miles on it in April 2008. Within two years and low miles, we had to replace both ball joints and now the entire transmission. I have since done research—shame on you Jeep Chrysler. And shame on the government for not forcing a recall on these matters. First of all, bad ball joints can cause accidents. Second, how often does an automatic transmission go out after four years? We have kept up on all the maintenance and never abused our vehicles. I just can't believe there are so many people out there with the same problems as I. No wonder the car industry is going bankrupt; they won't stand by their product. In these days and times, a person can barely afford to buy a vehicle let alone put out for such costly repairs.",1.0
"My 2004 Jeep Liberty keeps stalling. While driving, the jeep stalled and would not become idle.  This was right in the middle of a busy intersection, with our kids in the jeep.  We were told by a Jeep dealership that the engine computer has shorted out, and needs to be replaced.  The cost is $1,100.00.  They do not offer a new computer, only a rebuilt one that is available through the dealer.",5.0
"I ordered a 2012 Jeep Liberty Jet from the factory.  The engine ticks loudly, while in idle, and never stops.  At 50-60mph, the engine shudders, vibrates and has a roar to it, sounding and feeling like the wedges you go over, to slow your vehicle down.  It has 700 miles, and these are from going to the dealerships, and independent mechanics. 3 dealership trips, and 2 trips to independent mechanics.  Chrysler refused to do anything about it.",1.0
"I own a 2006 Jeep Commander, that I bought new. I have all of my receipts for everything, my truck has been well maintained, except for the fact that it has leaked since the beginning. I have had it serviced 7 times for the leak, and yet, I have a huge puddle in my passenger area, yet again. I don't know if there is mold in it, but they assure me that there isn't. I cant be sure. The car has also stalled for no reason several times. They can't explain that either. I don't know what to do with this truck. I have spent a small fortune getting it fixed over and over again, for the same problems.",2.0
"I have a 2006 jeep commander. I bought it 2 years old from dealership. I am experiencing a problem. When I go through the smallest of puddles, my belt must slip and I lose my ability to steer properly. Like having to power steering. I have brought it to my mechanic and have now brought it to jeep. No one not even jeep knows how to fix this. There has been references made to an undercarriage shield, yet jeep says my car doesn't have one made for it. The service department told me to avoid going through puddles at all costs. Do you know how impossible that is when it rains. So I have a Jeep Commander and I can't go through puddles.",1.0
"We have a 2008 Jeep Patriot and it was purchased new.  Within the first year, our sunroof started leaking.  We took the car to the dealership three to four times before they finally replaced the seal on it.  They kept saying they were bugs or leaves in the tracks.  It wasn't until I threatened to get a lawyer that they replaced the seal.  Our liner has spots on it from the water damage and the mechanic's hands.  We have now owned our car for three and a half years.  It has 46,000 miles.  This last month, it has started leaking again!
      We noticed water on the passenger side flooring (a puddle) and could not find water anywhere else.  After looking online, I thought it was possibly a clogged hose from the defrost.  We took the car to a mechanic who has confirmed that it would not be a problem and suggested that we go to a body repair specialist to find where the leak is coming from.  After looking at the car and the large puddle in our car, it looks like it is coming from somewhere around the rear window.  I have called Jeep and the assigned case manager will not commit to fixing it.  They want us to pay the dealership to look at it and then they may possibly allow us to have a copay to repair this.  How can they get by with this?  It appears that this is a common problem.  We feel that our car is ruined!  You can hear water under the floor!  Help!",1.0
"2003 Jeep Liberty Freedom Edition (original owner). 
      I have replaced the motor on my left rear window on three separate occasions. The first time was covered under warranty, but it was out of pocket the second and third time. It's expensive and apparently a consistent problem with other Jeep Liberty owners. According to the dealership in Davis, this part has not been recalled.With the first use of my car for the day, a metal grinding sound occurs when I brake (lasts for about 3-4 brake uses and then goes away). It's very loud and embarrassing, though I was assured that my life is not in danger. I was told that this is due to debris from the elements (air, dirt, etc.). I am the original owner of this Jeep Liberty and this has never happened in 8 years, until now.From a standstill and then pressing the gas pedal to drive my automatic Jeep, my car jerks (I can feel it and hear it) as if I were driving a stick shift car in the wrong gear. Dealer does not know why.My car has turned off three times when I stop at a red light (stop light, etc.) and I have to restart the Jeep. Sometime it turns on. Other times, I wait and then try again and it turned on. I just took it to the dealer where I was charged a hefty diagnostic fee. However, they could not tell me what the problem was. I am paying a fee, yet they can't determine the problem for my car turning off while I am in moving traffic.Does anyone know if it is ""legal"" to charge a diagnostic fee when the dealership can't determine the problem? I would accept the fee if they were addressing the problem; however, they are not.",1.0
"I purchase a brand new 2009 Jeep Liberty in August 2009 from Manhattan Jeep in New York City with the understanding that there was at 36,000-mile bumper to bumper warranty and an unlimited powertrain warranty. As per the warranty, I had my service routinely done at Riverdale Jeep in Bronx, NY. At 34,000 miles at 10:00 pm while on the NJ Turnpike with my 3-year-old son in the car, my car started overheating. I pulled over, popped the hood and smelled radiator fluid. I looked at the bottom of car and noticed radiator fluid dripping from under the car. I thought I had a radiator leak. 
      I called my husband and he brought me radiator fluid, we put in the radiator fluid and the car turned on, it was not overheating so we attempted to drive home (to be looked at in the morning at jeep). The car started overheating again, I pulled over in the gas station re-popped the hood brought more radiator fluid poured it in and noticed it pour out of the bottom of car. There was a mechanic who looked at car and noticed the water pump was totally broken. The mechanic indicated that this should not happen until about 100,000 miles. The car was towed to Little Ferry Jeep and they called me stating that the water pump was broken and that there was engine damage due to the broken pump but that they were voiding the warranty. I told them not to touch my vehicle and called a tow have my vehicle brought to my Riverdale Jeep dealer where I do my services.Little Falls Jeep changed the water pump without my permission and left a warranty hold on the engine damage that was directly caused as a result of the broken water pump as per Riverdale Jeep. Riverdale jeep was unable (even though they indicated that it should be covered) to cover under warranty due to Little Ferry changing the water pump and putting a void on my engine repair. Sonny, the mechanic at Riverdale Jeep in Bronx, NY explained to me that the engine damage is a direct result of the broken water pump that Little Falls took out of my vehicle without my permission. Sonny also indicated that since the water pump was totally broken, none of the coolant would have gotten to the engine and that the overheat light or sensor would not have told me this until a couple of minutes and that is why I have engine damage. Three cylinders need to be replaced, not the total engine as Little Falls would have led me to believe.Now I am paying $3,300 to Riverdale to fix damages to my engine that resulted from the defective water pump which all should have been covered under the lifetime powertrain warranty. The car is less than 2 yrs old. I want the $3,300 back and my powertrain warranty re-instated as per the purchase agreement.",1.0
"The Jeep Liberty 2.8L CRD has a flaw in its design.  The EGR valve is a high failure item in the 2.8 CRD.  One of the modes is set to ""fail ope"", with no accompanying ""Check Eng"" light.  When the EGR fails open, unregulated air flows into the intercooler, causing complete failure, and then allowing the turbo to receive unregulated air, leading to its failure.  This all happened in less then 3 miles last week, on my 2006 Jeep Liberty 2.8 CRD with 87,000 miles on it. $5,200 later the car is running, but what a bill for a poor design, with no bypass line. For wanting a $150 EGR valve, the motor was lost.",1.0
"I bought my 2007 Jeep Patriot brand new. About a year later, my jeep stalled at a light. It was raining and started right away so I figured maybe some water had gotten into a hose or the engine. It didn't stall after that for another year. Since then, it stalls every time it rains! I am so fed up with Jeep not recalling their vehicles for known issues. It seems like someone has to die and a lawsuit has to be filed before they do anything to fix their problems. I am so tired of having to invest money in this car.
      At around 60, 000 miles, I had to replace both ball joints. Even with an alignment my car still vibrates at high speeds. The transmission struggles when accelerating. I've had to replace all my rotors! My driver side window squeals as it is rolled up. There was a mysterious leak thru my trunk that resulted in water being accumulated where the spare tire is. Took it the dealership and they replaced the rubber gasket but the damage was already done. I service my SUV regularly so I wouldn't expect so many problems. I use fuel injection additives to make sure the fuel system is clean. I change my spark plugs on time. I never had this much problems with my 2000 Galant.",1.0
"My wife went to an automated car wash.  When the wash was done, she put the Jeep in drive and the vehicle took off on its own.  She could not get the Jeep to slow down at all.  Using all her force on the brake, she could not slow the vehicle down.  She ended up flipping the Jeep several times, totaling the vehicle.  Thank God there were no pedestrians or other vehicles involved.  She was lucky that she was not killed.  She has several broken ribs and lacerations and was badly bruised.  She’s never been in such pain.  I think that Chrysler needs to look at this situation very closely.  It also seems that the government should be stepping in also seeing how many of these incidents have now happened.  Could someone please help us with this on whom to contact about this?",5.0

When I got home, I opened the hood and checked the oil. It was completely gone, and it was less than 3000 miles since it's last change. It started to make a rattle sound, and so I took it to two different mechanics, one Chrysler and was told the entire engine needs to be replaced. I had refilled the oil and haven't lost any since, and now I find out that this has happened to many people and Chrysler replaced the engine and model and is not helping those that need the repair done.",1.0
"Ok, I have a few gripes and one really weird scenario for ya. I too have replaced the window motors on each door several times and have the problem code referring to the emission leak that cannot be found on a 2003 JGC.

      The alarm went off when she opened the door and she could not turn it off using her key fob. Now her remote will not open her car either. Funny, huh? So for the guy near Charlotte, NC with SC tags, that's why your remote doesn't work now! The car still works fine and I think I can reprogram the alarm system even if I have to take it to the dealer.

Finally, it stopped altogether and the switch actually broke off completely. I spoke with a person at a Jeep dealership about this. He quoted me a price for the part then let me speak with the labor department. When I spoke with them regarding the labor, the man did not have to look up the price.

Less than 6 months later, the rear driver side went out. They said that I had just ran out of warranty and it would be $330.00. Then, the driver side window went out and today, the passenger window went out. I cannot afford all of these window problem.

"I bought a brand new 2011 Patriot with only 5 miles on it in Feb. 2011. Before my first oil change, I had started having problems. On two separate occasions, I heard an unexplained noise almost as if my ball joint had broken and my wheel was about to fall off. The first time, it only happened for a few seconds, the second time I pulled over, nothing seemed wrong. When I got back in it, it drove fine. Of course the dealer couldn't do anything because there was not a malfunction light on. 
      Since then, the problems keep coming. There is a dead spot when accelerating around 50mph, I then have to mash the gas to get it past it. The transmission feels weak; the dealer won't do anything until it breaks. Then I just noticed the other day my door hinge has begun rusting already. I would expect it after about two years but not 8 months. Jeep has gone to hell since Chrysler bought them in the late 80's. I knew I should have bought a GM.",1.0
"My 2009 Jeep Patriot stalls out in traffic. Sometimes at a stop, sometimes on the freeway at 60mph. In July 2011, I drove this Patriot, which I have had complete confidence in since my purchase two years previous, to Los Angeles. While there, the Jeep stalled out and I was unable to start it again. I had it towed to the Chrysler dealership in Glendale. The gentleman who helped me in the service department got my Jeep in and repaired in mere hours. Originally they charged me $100 deductible against the warranty I purchased when I got the car. That same afternoon, the dealer called and said that charge had been a mistake and that they would be sending me a check, which they did.
      Less than two weeks later, however, I was in San Diego and the Patriot started stalling on me again. Rather than have it towed I was able to drive it into the dealer, though it stalled multiple times on the way. They had the car for three days and in the end, replaced the computer. They charged me the $100 deductible again, which I was fine with since the last dealer was reimbursing me. The Patriot drove fine for a few more weeks, all the way back to my home in Texas where it ended up parked for about two weeks without being driven. Then, when I was going to drive it, it wouldn't start. It seemed to be the exact same issue. In Texas I had it towed to the original dealer I'd purchased it from - Lone Star Chrysler in Cleburne. Their service department, knowing that I was soon to depart for California again for school, was attentive and though they admitted that they couldn't get the Patriot to do the same thing, they said they'd narrowed it down to two things - one being the ignition (I remember this because I had to bring my second key to them for programming). They also charged me the $100 deductible against my warranty.Two weeks later I'm back in San Diego where I am attending ministry school. The Patriot stalled out on me one evening on the way back to neighboring El Cajon, where I am living. The next day I was able to drive it into San Diego proper and to class. That afternoon I dropped it back to Midway Chrysler - the dealership that had worked on the Patriot previously. Midway Chrysler had the Patriot for two weeks, leaving me without a vehicle. They have repaired the Patriot but have wanted me to pay the $100 deductible before picking it up, which I am both economically unable to do and ethically just not comfortable doing.How long will Chrysler steal the warranty deductible from me for a problem on their car that they made? This car is an accident waiting to happen - a deathtrap. Stalling in the road can and will eventually lead to an accident that will not only inconvenience people but could possibly take someone's life. I've called the Chrysler warranty number. They have told me to continue working with the dealer. I called the dealer in Texas and they originally said that if I could get the car back to Texas that they would buy the Patriot back. I'd be willing to do that at the risk of having to drive the car another 1,500 miles, but after a weekend they changed their mind. Lone Star Chrysler in Cleburne, Texas did not want to buy back the Patriot, nor have they had any interest in helping me.",1.0

We have had the rear differential replaced three times and it is howling again.  All the window regulators have been replaced at least three times each.  We are so afraid to drive this vehicle out of town.  We rent one instead to go to the mountains or to travel to San Diego.  Our government wants us to buy American.  Why should we?

Clearly, they have a defective product on the market.  They simply don't care and refuse to issue a recall.  It is deplorable.  I have also had to replace the transmission.  And every time my battery dies, I have to get the car towed, because even after letting it charge for 30-60 minutes, the car dies the minute I put it in gear.

"To start, my father retired from Chrysler and we have always had Chrysler products. We have owned four or five jeeps, plus other Chrysler cars.

      We bought a new 2009 Jeep Liberty and not too long after we bought it, they had to replace the whole transmission. We have experienced terrible gas mileage of no more than 14 mpg, city or highway. That is awful. We would have gotten rid of it except we four down tow it and have the tow bar installed on it. We also have a brake buddy for it.Lately the key lock has not been working right, slow, and we thought it was needing a new battery. Then one morning, we went to leave in the car and all the dash lights came on and wipers wouldn't turn off. Then the car locked in park. We tried to figure it out for days and the dash finally said ""no bus"". You can't find out what that means anywhere. We finally got it out of park and drove it to the dealership. Guess what, dash board cluster was bad and to the tune of $608.00. This Jeep is only 1700 miles over warranty. We also have a 15-year-old Chev truck with 150,000 miles and never had the problems this Jeep has had, plus it gets way better gas mileage. The dealership Cueter Chrysler is the best I have ever worked with and their service is second to none. Too bad they don't have good vehicles to work on.I think Chrysler should at least pay the bill on this because it should have never gone bad in the first place.

"My Limited Jeep Liberty 2004 revs up when at a stop, particularly at stop signs and stop lights. This seems to be a problem with many jeeps after doing some search on the internet. The revving up has been getting worse.
      In addition, I just realized that I paid for the replacement of bad ball joints on my car soon after I purchased it from Diamond Dodge Jeep Chrysler in Flagstaff, AZ. Unfortunately, I have no clue about cars and I was told that I needed a replacement which cost close to $1,000 and only later, much later to find out that I had replaced and paid for something that there was a recall for. I took it back to the same dealership for the recall and they never once told me that they were going to refund me for the $1.000. I know I sound very dumb that I went along with the mechanic when they told me that my car needed two new ball joints and then later took it back in for a recall and only now finding out that they were the same issue. The terrible part is that I got it both done at the same dealership that I bought my car from and they did not tell me that they had the ball joints fixed already and that they would refund me my $1,000, instead, they told me they replaced the ball joints after they already had fixed it. Unfortunately, I can't do anything about it now as I've noticed that that dealership no longer exists, probably because they were up to no good.Is there anything I can do or anything you would recommend to me to do for both of my issues above?",1.0
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty rear window regulators have been replaced four times.  We do not even use the rear windows so there is no reason for them to just drop while driving.  Jeep will not do anything about this, and as I am seeing, this is a common problem.",1.0
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty (standard) has had all four windows changed.  It needed a new steering column because of a part built into the column to recognize the key (wouldn't start).  Also, it needed a new transfer case, and the back window leaks into the vehicle.  The shifting lever kept coming out when operating the vehicle.  The jack for changing tires doesn't lift the car up high enough to change the tire.
      Jeep dealer said that there was nothing wrong with the windows until they finally recalled them.  I had to duct tape them up so they wouldn't fall into the frame.  There was no point in locking the vehicle when all we had to do was push the window down!  My windows are beginning to sound just like they did when I had to have them all replaced the last time because the glass would fall into the door frame.I had to get a steering column from eBay because we were told by the dealer that they were on triple back order throughout the whole United States!  I also had to replace the transfer case when it blew apart in my driveway trying to move it after a heavy snow to get the driveway plowed.  I haven't even tried to fix the leak in the back window yet.  I had to get stack wood under the jack until it could lift the car up enough to change the tire.  What's next?  A five years old without off road driving and it is falling apart.  Not cool.",2.0

"This is my second Jeep. My 2001 Laredo experienced locking or freezing of the SUV. Very scary, driving down the interstate when your SUV freezes and you have no power or control, no power steering and you have to pray and glide to the side of the inner side of the highway. 
      This happened to me 3 times.I traded it, and bought a 2006 Laredo and thought my problems would be gone. Just the start! With 60,000 miles on it, I have the transmission light going off and the system goes into a slipping out of gear or a revving. I have to shake the gear knob to get it ""out"" of the malfunctioning mode! I have read a lot of similar problems. Besides these not-so-scary problems are the following: the seat belt light is on with the ** chime on, the air bag light is on, the check gas cap is on, and my low tire light is on. Believe me, my husband has checked all four tires with the gauge, filled them properly and there is nothing wrong with the tires! I will never ever buy or suggest a jeep to anyone! I hate Chrysler and believe me they are aware of these problems.Today, I am on my way to shop to see what they can or can't do to the jeep. Last time, when I had the tranny light problem, the shop said, ""Well, it isn't on now!"" Well, that is Murphy's law! It was on all the way down 44 miles to the service shop, but then when the ** jeep is being looked at, the light isn't on. This is a nightmare!",1.0
"In 2008, I purchased a New Jeep Patriot. In 2011 with only 28,915 miles on the vehicle, I had to replace both ball joints, and since the ball joint on this vehicle can only be replaced with the attached control arm, they also had to be replaced. I also had to replace two front tires because from rubbing on the defective parts, the tires were worn down to the steel belts. There is no way that this should have occurred with the low mileage on the vehicle. Jeep tells me that they have no recall on this model.",1.0
My Jeep's window regulators keep breaking.  I have installed four now and another just broke.  I have replaced each window now at least once.  The plastic nylon clips break and the cable winds inside the housing.  Chrysler has not recalled the regulators.  There is no recourse except to pay another $90 off the Internet and buy another one.  I don't know how they can get by with this.  There is enough complaints filed.  What is your organization doing to help?,1.0
"The rear power window regulator for my 2005 Jeep Liberty has broken three times. It broke in May on the first year, broke again in July of next year, and broke again in August of the following year. The window regulator replacement part seems to last only 14 months. This is disgusting and costly. It costs me hundreds of dollars. Jeep needs to compensate those of us who keep having to pay for these repairs, fix the windows or switch to crank windows in the back. Do we really need power windows in the back of a Jeep?",2.0
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty and I found I had bought a window monster. Not only did the regulator break, but you had to put a new window to go with it. I had six windows replaced, and two of them were the new model.
      I had 3 weeks left on my warranties when the last one happened. I argued with the service writer and he gave me a number to call. I called and argued with them and then I went to the website and sent in multiple complaints.Well, Jeep responded and sent me an extension, for the windows and regulators only, for ten years and it will go with the vehicle. So, go get them. They will work with you if you yell loud enough. I hope this helps the rest of the window droppers.",3.0

"Repair Issues - An improper or inferior repair
      Problem: On the 24 Nov 2010, I came into the Springfield Jeep and Chrysler dealership because my car had ran hot the day before. They said the problem was the therostate, but they could not tell which one was not opening so they said both had to be replaced. So I left my car and they replaced the first one and they had to order the second one. I returned on 2 Dec 2010 to have the second one replaced. Then two months later, my car ran hot again. So I was told to bring the car back, but the car did not run hot for them so they said they could not find out what the problem was so I left with my car and was told if it runs hot again bring it back. In two more months it ran hot again, again nothing happened in which they could not tell me what was going on. This continued until a week ago, when my car ran hot and would not cool down and I could not make it out to the dealership who had serviced it. I was told to take it to Liberty jeep and Chrysler in Hinesville, GA, where it is today. They told me something foreign was placed in the radiator and that I need a new radiator, new engine and air conditioner unit because the problem with my car was not fixed. It had gotten so bad everything was going wrong. Prior to this, my car was serviced in Maryland where I lived --at Fred's Jeep ad Chrysler in Laurel, MD.

      The lights, radio, etc. all works--it just wont start. This only happens every so often. I have not been able to narrow it down. No one seems to be able to pinpoint what the problem is. I have had so much money wrapped into figuring this out. I went online to try to see if anyone else has these issues. I was amazed at how many complaints of my kind there are. Wow.

"I am a corporate manager for a global company in Austin, Texas and am embarrassed in front of my colleagues to have purchased a Jeep.  I am extremely disappointed in my much anticipated custom ordered 2011 Jeep Sahara  4D 4x4, VIN: BL611285, purchased/picked up on May 13, 2011.
      I have purchased a Lemon and am extremely disappointed and embarrassed with all the issues I am experiencing with this Jeep.  It has left me stranded multiple times, where I've had to pull over and wait on the side of the road.  Twice it had to be towed, the farthest has been 150 miles away from my residency.  This has affected my life and interrupted my work schedule several times.On August 15, on multiple times, Jeep had to be towed to dealership due to loss of communication with computer. Repaired on August 10.  On August 2, the second time the Jeep went to dealership due to loss of communication with computer.  Hot oil and warning lights caused me to pull over, then Jeep would not start.  Work was performed on Aug. 10, re-flash computer. On July 14,  62 days from purchase date, I brought the Jeep to shop for miscellaneous issues and concern on rough engine start.  On June 23, 41 days from purchase date, warning lights flashed on.  During this time, I saw hot oil flashing  pulled over and called towing.  Work was performed (replaced wind module sensor--this seemed to address warning light issues).I am frustrated beyond belief that I am now considering following the recommendation of my Lemon Law lawyer, in addition to reporting my experiences with the BBB, plus publicize to numerous colleagues, family and friends on why they should not purchase a Jeep from Chrysler.I purchased  the Jeep upon recommendation from family members who also recommended Jeeps to several friends, some actually purchasing from Chrysler.

"My 98 Jeep is an amazing car.  It has saved my life a few times.  The major issue I've had with it is that a few years ago, I had to have the transmission replaced and fixed.  Almost immediately, I blamed the shop.  Thank God for warranties.  I've had it for 5 years.  And it still runs great.  But the issue now is that the gas mileage is slowly getting worse.  I don't know if it's just crappy gas companies putting something in the gas or what.  But I live about an hour out of Austin.  And it used to use less than a quarter of a tank to get there and back.  Now, even if I don't run the AC, it uses more than a quarter.  Let me just say it's Texas summer in a black jeep with no AC, and gas prices are going up everyday.",4.0

So I pulled off the highway and find a safe place to park, opened the hood and noticed that the fan blades that were attached to the water pump were hitting the alternator and I also noticed the antifreeze pouring out everywhere. 
      I called road side and they told me that a tow truck was on its way, but I had nowhere to stay as I was several hours away from home and no rental car company was open to rent me a car as it was late at night. So I spoke with roadside assistance and they assured me that a rental car would be covered while my car was getting fixed.

"I bought a brand new 2008 Jeep Liberty in February 2009; after a year and a half of purchase, my rear brakes went out. I called the service department and was told the brakes were not under warranty. I proceeded to taking it to another repair shop. I was informed that it is very uncommon for rear brakes to go out so soon. I had no other choice, but to replace the brakes without any further question.
      Now after just three-four months later, I began having more issues with the vehicle; smoking in the rear end, oil leaking and the smell of something burning and then the rattling in the rear, which ended with the rear brakes completely locking up on me--leaving me stranded at night, with my six year old son and my 18 month old daughter. I had to have the car towed to the dealership the following day. They had the vehicle for two days, stating it was the rear-end differential that went out. I was at that time asking for a rental car, which the dealership said they did not do. So, I was at that point without a vehicle, and I had to miss work for three days while it was being repaired. I got the vehicle back by the third day. The next day, while driving the vehicle to work, I started to notice a humming sound when I would accelerate. I also still noticed the burning odor in the rear end. The humming sound was to the point that even my six year old asked me why the car was making a sound. It took me a week to call the dealership again regarding these issues due to the fact that I simply needed my vehicle. I did not want to miss any more days of work. During this week’s time, the car battery went dead while I was trying to make it to my children’s babysitter and to my place of employment. This of course caused me to be late to my job once again. I contacted the dealership and brought the vehicle back in. It is now three days, and they still have my car.I received a call from Sam ** on Friday afternoon. She stated they needed to wait for a spare part for the repair, and they could not tell me when they would be able to have the vehicle finished. She also implied that the vehicle was inspected, and was perfectly fine when it left the dealership. I asked at this time to speak to a manager, as my frustration was reaching its limit. I spoke to three different people who stated the managers were all in a meeting; so, I left two different messages for a manager to return my call, which they never did. I am now again stuck at home with my two young children without a way to get around.The idea that this is a new vehicle and is already having so many problems is very disturbing to me. My sole purpose of having a new vehicle with monthly car payments is so that I do not break down like this. I feel that, at the very least, this dealership should supply me with a loaner vehicle, and have the common courtesy to at least return my call as any business should do to satisfy their customers.",
"We have a 2006 Jeep Commander. It was built after January of 2006; so, it does not fall under the recall. All of the lights on the dashboard of the vehicle would light up and then it would immediately shut off. The same with the gas gauge, RPM, and climate controls. The vehicle will still drive. When we have taken it to several Jeep dealers and other mechanics, no one was able to tell us what is wrong with the vehicle. We had nothing but only problems with this vehicle, including installing a new starter which seems to be a known problem, as well as the leaking through the hand grips for driver and passenger.
      It is frightful and dangerous to be in a vehicle going 60mph, plus just to have all the lights on then everything will shut off except the engine. We even had a diagnostic at home, and it does not indicate what the problem is. After the problem happens, the check engine light does not stay on. So, it is difficult to get a reading. Is there a recall to get this electrical problem fixed? What should we do since we are scared to drive the vehicle due to this problem? Please, let me know.Thank you,Kristin **",

"My husband and I purchased a 2006 Jeep Commander in October 2005. I didn’t have very many problems with the Jeep until September 2009. While driving on the freeway at 70 mph, the jeep stalled on me and the check engine light came on. I was able to get off the freeway and have it towed to a dealership. I was told that I needed to have my throttle body cleaned. $200.00 later, I was on the freeway. In October 2010, my Jeep started stalling on me again. I was told that my throttle body needed cleaning again. 
      The Jeep ran fine for a month or so. In April 2011, I took the Jeep in for servicing. Of course, throttle body cleaning again. Since then, I have taken my Jeep back to the dealership at least every two weeks for stalling. I was driving on the freeway and it stalled on me. I was told a piece of cloth somehow got caught near the throttle body. It worked for two weeks, and then it stalled on me again. I was told that I needed to change my mapping sensor and IACV valve. I changed those and a week later, it was back again. A week after that it was back again, all for stalling and idling RPM, I was driving home on June 15, 2011 and the Jeep stalled on me while in the middle of traffic and I was almost rear-ended by a truck. Needless to say, I have filed complaints with Chrysler and Jeep. They refuse to help me with a rental car since I am out of warranty. They haven't offered to help with repair costs. I asked them to help me get into another vehicle and that was refused. Even the service advisor at Dodge told me he didn’t think I would ever put my kids in that Jeep again.

"Back in 2007, we purchased a brand new 2007 Silver Jeep Liberty off the lot.  During that time, my wife was active duty army (and still is).  In the state of Colorado when you are active duty, you do not need your title to register the car.  They only need a copy of your orders and an affidavit of non-residence.  So for the first 2 years, we had no problem registering our car.  However, in 2009, we relocated to Florida on a new assignment.  We had then made the decision to register our car down here and that is where the fun began.  We went to the DMV and they requested the title and gave us temporary tags.  When those expired a month later, we went back to register the car but they didn't get the title.  At that time, we weren't worried.
      The DMV requested it again and gave us a new set of temporary tags.  Again, we got no call that our title was in so when those expired, the DMV still hadn't received our title.  Now it was worry time as the DMV said 2 temporary tags were the max.  We started frantically calling to see what the deal with our title was.   We found out that this car had never been titled.  At this point, we were confused (around late 2009 early 2010) after numerous phone calls and even more assurances that it was being handled.  It is now 5/27/2011.  After getting off the phone, they still have no clue to the title on this vehicle.  Even to exacerbate the problem further, we got rid of our second vehicle (another Jeep, which I will never make that mistake again), as we were moving to a 2-mile by 4-mile island.  So, this is our only car with 2 young children.  And it is illegal to drive and we can't get base tags either.  So, we can't leave our house in the car!In this case, you may think they would offer a loaner or a rental to get us by while they figure out our title.  But there my friends you would be wrong, as even when asked, they denied us a viable alternative.  So here I am typing this in awe and bewilderment to the treatment I have received from Chrysler and Lithia dealership on not only their ineptitude, but on their unwillingness to offer a short term solution to a problem that has lasted for almost 2 years now, and that we have no control over.  Oh, but don't let us be late on a payment or then we would be toast.  But no, we have never been late on a payment and we still carry insurance on this illegal car.  And here’s one extra tidbit.  3 of the 4 windows have malfunctioned (which they have recalled but we can't resolve in an illegal car).  And the A/C quit working a year ago (which needs a $500 plus compressor and labor cost).  Thank you Jeep/Chrysler for finally convincing me to buy only foreign made cars, as this is my last straw with your cheaply made junk!",

Apparently, there is a new improved part that they are offering and they think that they are successful with it. This is $280 to be fixed versus the $350 it used to be. I know that the other window will break again which will be another $280 for the same part being the 13th time I have to replace the part. I would like a discounted rate for replacing these parts or even for free since an estimate cost over the years to replace it has been $3,850.",

In the event of a larger problem with the gear box in the transmission, we had no other choice but to take it to a Jeep garage to be fixed. This was the closest one to our house in Belgium. When we returned to pick the Jeep up 2 days later, we were given a bill for 100 euro and we're told they were not be able to fix the problem. But they did find it was the gear box which needed work. So upon speaking with the service manager and coming to the agreement, no work was done and nothing new discovered. We were still left to pay the bill (or they would not give us the keys).",
"I purchased a brand new 2006 Jeep Commander, Hemi, 4x4, fully loaded.  It was the first brand new car purchase for me and the worst experience.  What a disappointment!  It's a beautiful car on the outside but beware.  It’s a mechanic’s dream and owner's nightmare!  Thank goodness I purchased an extended warranty on the ** thing as it has helped with some of the expenses.  Two weeks after owning the car, there was a bad knocking noise in the engine.  I had it taken to the dealership twice.  Of course, they couldn't duplicate the issue.  2 mechanics who heard it all told me it was the lifters.  Nothing ever got done.  To this day, it still makes a knocking noise without any warning.  Like the others, this car has left me stranded a total of 5 times.  It has had 3 batteries put in.
      The last battery change seemed to help.  But I pray every time I start my car that it doesn't happen again.  I had to replace both front and back brakes at 12,000 miles.  And I had to do another back rotor and back break change at 30,000 miles.  At 40,000, the front left wheel bearings went out.  Then at 77,000 miles, the radiator leaked and had to be replaced.  Also, the windshield wiper pump went out and had to be replaced.  But that's not it.  I can't get but 15,000 miles out of the tires I put on regardless of the brand.  I have had to put new tires on my Jeep each year I have owned it.  They are rotated on a regular basis so I don't know what the heck is going on.  The tires wear terribly on the outside and inside with plenty of tread still left in the middle.  I have had to do so much maintenance to this car for it being brand new and well taken care of.  I couldn't give this vehicle away at this point, nor would I want to burden anyone down with the expense!",
I have had the window regulator replaced three times on the passenger rear window and twice on the driver rear window. Driving with little ones in the back seat is a problem with the window down. Duck tape does work but it takes off the window film I had placed on due to the Texas sun.,
"Chrysler is refusing any type of financial assistance to my Jeep Liberty with 56,000 miles that is yet to be paid off. Even though the warranty has expired, I think it's a shame that a corporation refuses to stand by their products, at least until it's paid for. Repair cost $1,582.",
"Over the past couple of months, my vehicle has gotten progressively worse with intermittent engine stalls. After Googling this problem and seeing that this is an inherent problem with Jeep, I felt that it needed to be documented.
      So far I've been lucky that it hasn't stalled in the middle of an intersection. Hopefully, Chrysler Jeep will do something to remedy this problem before someone gets seriously hurt.",
"This is a complaint about the design of the SUV.  Last year, I bought a 2010 Jeep Commander and I am very surprised about how inefficient things were designed. They didn't put any thought into things.  My very old Mitsubishi Endeavor is far superior. At least they took the time to make the SUV with a good interior and efficient design. I am not buying another American SUV ever again.",
"The problem with window regulator and transmission is going into limp mode and stuttering. I need to replace the software in TCM or new transmission all together, power windows are horrible also, need to recall transmission problem and window problem as soon as possible. This will be the last jeep product of my life!",
"My 2007 Jeep Commander stalled while driving on the highway above 50 mph.  Sometimes, it would not shift or would delay in shifting from low gear.  Sometimes, the panel display would show all gears light up when problems occurred.  Now, the vehicle will not start without changing gears several times--if it starts at all.  We had the Jeep towed into the dealer and the dealer wants to replace the Transmission Control Module (TCM) for $1,000.00 (part only) cost.",
"Random acceleration and /or inability to accelerate when pushing the gas pedal as well as the windshield design is such that it doesn't deflect stones, even with a guard. I have been driving my 2007 Jeep Commander for 3 months and have 4 cracks in my windshield from stones hitting it while driving, not off road either. These problems are expensive to fix and are dangerous not to fix. Very disappointed in what I thought was a reliable vehicle.",
"I was driving at the speed of 35 mph, lost control of steering for no reason, hit a cement pole and the medium have went through the passenger side window, head first breaking the cement pole across oncoming traffic. I have neck pain, a concussion, and 25 stitches in my face disfiguring my face. I have had short term memory loss and will have scars all on my right side of my face.",
"My complaint concerns one that has been voiced by many and that is the defective product Jeep used for electric windows. Both my rear windows don't work and one keeps inching down, so I have been taping it to keep it rolled up. I had a shop look at it and they told me that it is so common, the part to correct it is back ordered for 2 weeks. Jeep should have recalled their vehicles for this! It will cost me almost $400 to repair this.",
"In my 2006 Jeep Commander the door latches break. Now I’m stuck in the car in fear that if I’m in a car accident, I can’t get out. I talked to the car dealer and they say that it’s because of wear and tear. Back doors are also broken and they are barely used.",
I replaced 4 windows regulators in last 15 months. Replaced total of 5 window regulators since the purchase of the vehicle.,
"I am writing about my 2005 Jeep Liberty. At around 40,000 miles I needed a new engine on one side and the other side a few months later. My window regulators continue to break in the back while my car is just sitting. I never roll the back windows down and they are seldom used. I have been charged up to $387.00 for this item and they have been repaired five times now. This should be a recall item I have never had a vehicle do these things before. I have spoken to other jeep liberty customers with the same problems. (Engine and windows)The problem with the window part is the plastic that just snaps in the cold or hot weather. $300.00 and some odd dollars is a lot to keep paying for this over and over again.",
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty in April 2008. The car had 14000+ miles. I brought the car back short time after purchasing because of a window problem. I was told it was dirty down inside. It happened again and I said I can not come every time. I found out the window regulator to be no good. The front driver side, then a while later, the back driver's side. They said they did a courtesy fix. But I purchased an extended warranty that the salesperson told me was bumper to bumper up to 60,000 miles.
      I also knew at this time that the window regulators were defective, and that they made a whole new window placement. I paid 100.00 ded for my insurance for a defective product. Well, now my 3rd window passenger back side ops 8th or 9th time down. It broke while I have 40,000+. I was still assuming it was under warranty as I have a great warranty, as I was told when being pushed into purchasing at the beginning and told never have to worry. Well, that was bull**.Now I was told it would cost 600.00 plus to fix. That it was not covered under warranty. I went postal. I am going to report this to BBB. also to Chrysler. The service person called me and said the manager would give me a courtesy and this would be the last one. Are they for real? This is a defect in their product and they think they're doing me a favor. I paid for a warranty. and they took my 100.00 ded last time. Do not buy jeep.",
A 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo keeps stalling out while driving. I have replaced a lot of parts yet the problem still exists. I have checked the internet and found a lot of jeep owners who have the same problem. I think this jeep should be recalled and all jeeps with this problem and fix them. It is dangerous. It just stalls out anywhere with no warning.,
"In 2006 I bought a brand new Jeep Compass. I drove it off the light, not knowing a light was an engine light problem, it took the dealership 7 months to figure out how to turn the engine light off. Then approximately one year after I bought it, the right ball joint went out. I took it back in and they fixed it. It was under warranty. Then 43000 miles and 3 years later, the left ball joint went out, but it is no longer under warranty. Because it was unsafe and not under warranty, I took it to a frame and axle place by my house. I then called Jeep corporate to ask if they would reimburse me and stand behind their product because a ball joint should not be going out in a pretty new vehicle. they refused to reimburse me. I am out $469.61 for a defective part that Jeep will not reimburse me for.",
"On April 3, 2009, I was told that I needed a regulator for my 2006 Jeep Liberty left rear window. Parts, labor and tax equaling $277.29. Again on August 30, 2010, I was told I needed another regulator and glass for the same window at a total cost of $357.60. This is obviously a defective, faulty part being manufactured out of Chrysler, especially since I am single and that window is rarely ever used. I would like to be at least partly reimbursed for this issue. $357.60 spent on second regulator in the only window in less than 17 months.",
I bought a Jeep Commander in 2007. The dash lights keep going off and then they would all come on. The air conditioning will go off while driving down the road. It does this for about 1 minute and then everything goes back to normal. I have taken it to the shop twice and they cannot find anything wrong. I have read many complaints about this similar problem and people are saying that their jeep just dies while driving causing a very dangerous situation which could lead to a very severe if not fatal accident.,
"I dropped off my Jeep to get fix the roof because it got stuck in one corner and they said that okay, they were going to fix it. Still after so many lies and no phone calls. Twelve days later and counting and no one is willing to help. I have no car stuck in my house, didn't give me a rental a car or at least willing to help me. It's stressful being home stuck at home.",
"We purchased a 2006 Jeep Commander in 2008. My complaint is headlights flickers on and off along with the dash lights. We have a basic model. Our headlights have to be turned on. Our vehicle does not have running headlights. There's no warning when the headlights will flicker on and off. This all happens while I'm driving at night. You can be driving and or the car is sitting still. I've taken our vehicle to be serviced at Jeep several times. Each time Jeep is unable to find anything wrong with the vehicle.
      They stated, ""it's running fine and we cannot find any problems"". I contacted Jeep Chrysler Group on many occasions at 1-800-. We have asked if we could get a Replacement vehicle. We do not want to trade this vehicle and make this someone else problem. It's not safe to drive. We keep getting the run around. They said we should speak with Nahum, and then he forwarded it to another department. Then they said, Bonnie is our Case Manager. Then they said, Bonnie is not our Case Manager and we were giving the wrong information.Each time we call every week and sometimes twice a week, they tell me someone will contact you. So far, no returned calls. This is really bad customer service. This vehicle is unsafe to drive. I do not drive at night because the headlights flicker on and off and sometimes do not come back on. I'm afraid to drive this vehicle. We have children in the car when this happens. People curse me out, blow their horns and just say some really bad things to me. All because they think I'm turning my headlights on and off at them while driving. I do not want me or my family to get hurt because of this. We need help and there may be someone else in this world that may be going through the same thing. Take this vehicle off the street.",
"The third power window regulator failed on my 2004 Jeep Liberty. I just had the driver's side replaced 4 weeks ago at a cost of $150 with the assistance of Chrysler. Both of my rear windows are inoperable at this time because I have been waiting on an after market repair from a third party. Chrysler replaces like for like using the same nylon gear, ergo, it shall fail again. One can say normal wear and tear but I am a single fellow that does not even use the back windows and they are the ones I have blocked up! It would appear, reading all the forums and complaints about the problem, that it is and has been a known design problem for years. It is very sad to know that a company can be ""bailed out"" by taxpayer dollars and continue to not correct the design nor recall the defective vehicles.",
"I bought a 2009 Jeep Patriot in July 2009.  A month after having it, I started to notice the gas gauge was not reading accurate.  I took the vehicle to the dealer. They told me it was a problem that Chrysler was aware of but did not know yet how to fix, and that I should continue checking with them for any updates.  In Jan. or Feb. 2010, the dealer said they were told that a fix would be available in Apr. 2010.  That didn't happen.  In May 2010, the dealer said they were told that parts were being manufactured and fix would be released in June or July 2010.  It didn't happen again.
      This time I contacted Chrysler customer complaint phone number and told them I wanted to know when they planned on fixing my vehicle, because I have had it for a year and it had a defect all this time.  They kept referring me to a case manager that they had assigned to me.  But he would never return my calls to tell me when the fix would be released to the dealers.  I called customer service numerous times and complained about the vehicle not being fixed and about the case manager not returning phone calls.  I was told that Chrysler had no more info on the problem and it was in the hands of the business office and the district manager over the dealerships.  I told them I wanted to speak to someone who was in charge of the case managers.  But they pretty much refused to that and told me it was not customer service’s problem anymore, and would not let me voice my complaint to anyone higher up in the company. I contacted the dealer again.  They said that the district manager told them that the fix would be released in the first week of August 2010, but it appears that will not happen again.  I hate to think this is what we got when we bailed Chrysler out.  They have never even offered me anything for the year.  I have sat back and waited on them to solve the problem.  But they told me lie after lie and that I must continue waiting and paying for a vehicle that I never have a clue how much gas it really has in it.",
"I have a 2005 Jeep Liberty that had the motor replaced in February of 2009. The motor only had about 64000 miles on it. The motor messed up again in May 2010. This time, the motor had around 42000 miles on it. The old motor was replaced with a Chrystler motor. The dealership told me the warranty was only good for 12 months or 12000 miles which ever came first. 
      I will never get a Chrystler product again because of the service I have received! My Jeep has been nothing but a big headache from the time I got it. I had the front drive shaft replaced last year. The brakes and rotors have been replaced four times in two years. The water pump was replaced last year and the timing belt was also replaced. I am very dissatisfied with my Jeep Liberty and I would not recommend one to anyone else!",
"Since I purchased my 2004 Jeep, 3 of the 4 window regulators have failed. Recall anyone? The window just drops unexpectedly. Luckily, my car hasn't been burglarized after the window dropped overnight. I'm a 3rd year law student and my school isn't exactly in the nicest neighborhood. I would really hate to have any of my casebooks stolen. The Jeep dealer wants $500 to fix it since my car is no longer covered under warranty. Private auto mechanics charge $200 for the part and average $90 for the labor. So there's that, plus a few bucks for the duct tape that now holds my window in place. Classy.",
"I have a 2005 Jeep liberty and my ABS, ESP BAS, and Traction Control lights have all come on. I have done a lot of research on the internet about this and found that it is a very common occurrence. I see that the 2007 Jeep Liberty has been recalled for this problem, and I'm wondering why the 2005-2006 ones haven't been? 
      I live in a place where it snows 6 months out of the year, and I have no traction control or automatic breaks, I cannot even drive my vehicle in the winter time!",
"Our 2005 Jeep, without any lift kit or modifications done to it, has the 'death wobble.' The first time it happened it was under warranty and we were told it needed to have the rotors turned. We did that. Now it is out of warranty and they want $1000 to fix it. We only have 25,000 miles on it.",
"I have a 2006 Jeep Commander which I purchased a short time ago. On a recent trip, my son went to open the passenger door and the interior door latch would not open the door. The part of the door panel which holds the latch had completely broken away from the panel. I also see that this is happening to the driver's door as well. It is a safety issue as one could become trapped in the vehicle. I understand that this is an ongoing problem with this vehicle. I also understand that it may be an expensive repair.",
"This will be the 4th window that I have had to replace/repair in my Jeep Liberty. There is a known defect in the design of the original window regulator. Jeep has since redesigned the part but it requires a new glass window as well. Each time the window is repaired it costs $600. Jeep won't recall the parts. Why? Because it is not a high risk safety issue. 
      I would beg to differ when I have my child sitting in the back seat and the regulator decides to go out and the window slides into the door jam giving my toddler access to outside while I'm on the highway. Jeep is making a nice profit for it's dealerships service departments who are getting the big bucks from fixing this issue. At $600 a pop you are looking at $2400 for the 4 windows and I can guarantee you that if you don't have the new design you'll have to replace it.",
"My Jeep constantly stalls.  I first started looking online into forums about this issue and found hundreds of the same issue.  Most said that the computer module was the cause.  The times I have had the Jeep checked out, the computer was to blame as well.  So, I had the computer replaced and still have the issue.  I have spent $100 replacing parts and trying to fix the issue but the problem persists. 
      At this point, I don't believe that there is a fix for it, but just a lesson learned not to ever again purchase a Jeep!",
"2006 Jeep Liberty window regulator went bad in the passenger rear window. It cost over $400 to replace. Apparently, this is a common defect and Jeep has not issued a recall.",
"I have a 2007 Jeep Compass. The first time I started experiencing problems, the engine was stalling and/or wouldn't accelerate. I talked to my brother, who is a mechanic, and he recommended to take it to the dealer, since the vehicle was still under warranty. I gave the car a tune-up. After $300 (apparently regular maintenance is not covered by the warranty), all they did was change some plugs, and check the different oils in the car. 
      Not even two months later, January 2010, my car was towed to the dealer because it completely died. The engine stalled, lights on the dashboard went crazy, and I just couldn't accelerate, and then it simply died in the middle of the road. It wasn't a major road, and it was very early in the morning.  I was taking my kids to ""before care"" at their school.  Thanks to these conditions, there was no accident involved.  The guy who towed my car explained to the dealer that he thought it was the engine, however the dealer, after checking up on my car, decided it was only a bad coil that was causing that on the engine. The guy at the dealer asked me if I had washed my engine, I told him no.  Instead of looking what had caused the coil to go bad, they simply replaced it and sent me on my way. At first the car was running fine, but soon after, I started noticing the same heaviness when accelerating. Five months later, 7/11/2010 to be exact, I was driving down I-16 (GA), and the car started stalling. I couldn't accelerate, even though the gas pedal was down to the car floor. Then my emergency signals on the dashboard started blinking. Apparently, I had a tire with only 10 air pressure. I really was concerned but being about 2 miles away from the exit to my house, I decided to continue.  When I pulled over at the gas station on the corner, the tire was fine, we checked the pressure and it was 35. I was very concerned. So, someone drove the car for me, and noticed the inability of the car to accelerate.  It was almost like the engine couldn't switch or engage, and therefore it was impossible to accelerate. On 7/14/2010, I called the dealership and stated my problem. I also called Chrysler Corporate, and explained my situation, they assigned me a case number. In the afternoon when I took the car to the dealer they said that to be able to look at my car, I will have to pay $75 for the diagnostics. I was furious, since I had taken the car twice to the dealer and they have failed to repair the problem. The issue is that now my warranty is expired, and so I am responsible for the charges. I refused to pay any money, since I believed it was their responsibility to correct whatever it is wrong with my car from the very beginning, and they have not. The dealer agreed to run diagnostics to my car free of charge. However, the dealer and Chrysler states there is no assurance they will cover for repairs, since the car is out of warranty. I feel they failed to repair my car properly, knowing I would be back, and by then the money will have to come out of my pocket. I have read that the stalling problems, the crazy dashboard, and the sudden death of the car, are problems common not only to 2007 Jeep Compass, but also to several other models, and manufactured years. This issue needs to be addressed. I am literally scared to use the car.  I keep thinking it can die on a highway with my kids inside! I have filed a complaint with the NHTSA, and other consumer advocate sites, but I believe someone will have to go through a very serious accident for Chrysler to do something real about this issue, that affects so many of its cars. While writing this, the dealer called and said they weren't able to recreate the problem, but there was a couple of software updates. They performed the updates, and told me to pick up my car. They, however, offered to let me drive the car and see how it performs. If I have any other problems to take it back to the dealer. But during this time, I have to drive the vehicle with whatever problem it still has.  The car is unsafe to drive. I have already spent $300 or more on the car. I have only one car, therefore, the time that it spends at the dealer, I have to make different arrangements, which includes borrowing a car from people, who end up without a car during that time. It is also very emotional to have to drive a car that can make you have an accident, that could cost my family, or myself our lives.",
"This is not a complaint about service. This is a complaint about the new auto styling concerning the narrowing of the height of car windows.  What on earth is going on? I'm buying a new car, and having a hard time choosing one, for one reason. I like to rest my elbow on the window ledge, and now it's too high. I really don't like this at all narrower window. Where is the joy of driving going?",
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty that has 3 broken windows. When I finally ordered the regulators, I received a message from the auto parts store. I was told that the order had been canceled because Jeep had just issued an order that said the regulators could no longer be sold due to a new and improved regulator that was now available. Only thing is, with the new part you have to replace the window as well. I asked the guy if he was seriously saying I needed to replace the perfectly good glass in 3 windows because JEEP came up with a new regulator that could only be used with a new window. 
      He seemed embarrassed, but said there was nothing he could do. Of course the regulator and window were a total of $300 or more. I guess too many people had started changing their own parts so they had to figure out a way to get a piece of the consumer. My windows are not operable. Please include me on any class action suit.",
"Rear drivers side window just fell down 2nd time. Dealer replaced the window and regulator on same window under warranty. Now they want to charge a diagnostic fee for something that is obvious. Had I known this, I would have never purchased the vehicle. I only hope I get better luck than some of the other people with this problem. My vehicle is at the dealer right now and I am going to show them all of these complaints. Why doesn't Jeep do a recall and fix this defect? This already has cost me a $60.00 diagnostic fee. Possibly, a couple hundred for a new regulator and window.",
"I have only owned my Jeep Liberty not even a month and while I was driving on the highway my window fell down. I am taking it in to be fixed tonight, but I almost was in a car accident due to the load noise it made when it fell. I was in rush hour traffic when this happened.",
"I have a 2006 Jeep Commander that is having a problem with stalling. I was riding down the road at 55 mph and the vehicle just quits on me. I have no power, vehicle is hard to steer. The vehicles behind me have to slam on brakes and run off the road to keep from hitting me. This is the second time this has happen in two months. I have taken my Commander to 2 different Chrysler dealership and they both say nothing is wrong with the vehicle. I have called Chrysler 10 times and no one has gotten back with me. I am afraid to drive this vehicle for fear that I may cause a major accident. Chrysler does not seem to care.",
"I am submitting this because I do not know in what direction to turn. I purchased a 2008 Jeep Commander on October 3, 2008. I average approximately 100 miles a day due to the requirements of my employment. Currently, there is 46,000 miles on my Commander. I first began to encounter problems with the vehicle around 42,000 miles. Engaging the key, there was a slight hesitation of 1-3 seconds prior to the engine turning over. This gradually began to progress to 5-10 seconds. It got to a point in which if I drove it, it would not start until it sat idle for at least 8-10 hours. Eventually, it would not start at all.
      I contacted Chrysler Jeep and was told that towing would be offered at cost to the consumer since it was past the 36,000 mile limit. My insurance company, Safeco, indicated that I had towing on my policy but it could only tow to a certified Chrysler Jeep dealership within a 15 mile towing radius. It was subsequently towed to the Thompson dealership since it met the criteria. The problem was diagnosed as being the wireless ignition module. I was charged $487.33, invoice #**. The vehicle ran good for two and a half weeks then began to exhibit the same problems. It eventually gave out. I started the vehicle and drove it to the Thompson dealership. It broke down there. After ""jiggling"" the key, it started and the service advisor, Richard, drove me home. This occurred on June 9. On June 14, I was informed that they could not find the cause of the problem. It should be pointed out here that my initial request was that if I was going to have a high end repair to notify me prior. I began to go online and found out the commonality of problems encountered by 2008 Jeep owners and was shocked. A recall of front control modules was often cited including the tendency for the vehicle to stall while driving. I contacted the lemon law attorneys but they would not accept because it was over the 36,000 mile limit. I contacted the Maryland State Attorney General's office and was transferred to the Consumer Protection Division. I submitted a formal complaint but was notified it would take 4-6 weeks in order for the division to respond. At this point, I was informed that they could only act as a inter-mediator.  I next contacted the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration. The procedure was duplicated. I submitted a complaint with a lag time of 4-6 weeks. I was assigned a Chrysler case manager, Andrew **. His solution was to get a second opinion. I asked, ""From who?"" If a certified dealership did not know the answers, who would? What were the logistics involved? Was I to tow the car from dealership to dealership at my expense? He said a member of their response team was to get back with me by June 16. It never happened. I called back the subsequent week and he was totally oblivious to the specifics of my case. He repeated that I needed to get a second opinion. It was at that time I requested another case manager. I was given an equally inept case worker, Kristy, **. She prompted the same response as the previous case worker but with a twist. The area district manager was to get in touch with me not later than June 29. To Chrysler's defense, they did offer to reimburse me for the front control module repairs. I have to submit my original repair documents and a determination then has to be made. I have a potential death trap. As with Toyota, I need to know how many people will needlessly have to be injured or killed before a class action suit will be initiated. The problems of the 2008 Jeep Commander are extensive and these have been documented. They are taking a lackadaisical approach when it comes to addressing the concerns of the consumer. I would imagine after they defaulted in the repayment of the $7 billion bailout, Chrysler would be more proactive in addressing the concerns of the consumer. I have a vehicle sitting in front of my place of residence. No one knows what's wrong with the thing. I spoke with the actual mechanic doing the repairs. He is really cordial and knowledgeable. He said that he has worked on the vehicle on his own time without pay. He said that he can run more extensive tests which would be costly and may not still yield favorable results. At best, he will trouble shoot or trial and error. I believe the problems are the result of faulty manufacturing. In some Jeeps, it was found that Chrysler installed faulty Mitsubishi starters. I need to emphasize, Thompson Chrysler Jeep and the service advisor, Richard **, as well as the mechanical have been superb. They are the only bright spots out of the whole ordeal. They couldn't have a more professional group of people representing the Chrysler logo; and Bruce **, who should be elevated to case manager. Much more personable than Kristy or Andrew will list my current case worker as the perpetrator, Kristy ** and Andrew **. I have no confidence in my Commander or Chrysler and will not ever buy a US vehicle again. Chrysler complaint no. **.",
"I just lost my third window. It fell into the door within 200 feet! This time I didn't even get a chance to tape it up! I will need to get ""the little piece in the door"" replaced again. They promised me that they have changed the part, but would not give me information on it when I replaced the second one. I will need to pay for another window repair with no guarantee it will not happen again. It’s like feeding popcorn to someone in a theater!",
"In 2006, I purchased a new Jeep Commander. Before the incident, which I will mention here, I often told people this was the best car I'd ever owned. I really enjoyed the 5.7L Hemi engine and 4-wheel drive with Quadra-Drive II transmission. I experienced one major problem though. In March 2009, when the Jeep was exiting the drive chute of the local car wash, one of the attendants jumped in and started the engine. Immediately, the vehicle surged forward. The attendant bailed out the open door, leaving the Jeep to fly forward. I literally mean ""fly forward"" since it hit a curb, jumped a foot or two high and flew over an adjacent depressed roadway. It was ""flying"" about eight feet vertically in the air and 39-feet horizontally before it landed on its rear wheels. 
      The car then continued unpiloted between two rows of parked cars in the parking lot of a restaurant at about 25-30mph for another 150-200 yards before knocking over a light standard and becoming stuck by straddling a raised earthen berm with all four wheels suspended. If the vehicle had not been stopped by the light standard and berm, it would have entered onto a busy 4-lane highway. The car wash attendant received minor injuries in the bailout. Fortunately, no one got in the way of the runaway Jeep or serious injury/death would have occurred. The Jeep was seriously damaged, including a bent frame, but ultimately repaired and I've been using it without incident since. I continue to enjoy driving my Jeep, but I am now leery of a repeat incident. I still love her, but I know that since she strayed once, she might do so again.",
"I took my '03 Jeep Liberty for a bad window regulator on 06/03/09. They failed to tell me about your complaint department and charged me $367.70 because the car had 56,411 miles then. On 02/10/10, the car went to Moore Jeep for same problem and was fixed under warranty with 57,456 miles then. (No charge to me). On 05/19/10, the car went to Moore Jeep for the same problem and was fixed under warranty with 57,923 miles now. (No charge to me). You can see the pattern here. I am wondering why this was corrected with 57,923 with no charge; 57,456 with no charge. And at 56,411 miles, Moore charged me $367.70. I don't know if Moore Jeep or Chrysler owes me. Someone owes me $367.70. Please contact me on how to expect payment. I have all this documented with my bills. If I can look this up online, I am sure you can too. Thanks again.",
"Windows on the 2007 Jeep Liberty are not working. The windows have to be replaced and cost a lot of money. That new vehicle shouldn’t have to have windows fixed this soon because of something the factory did. I’ve owned a Jeep for the last 6 years. I’ve bragged about mine to everybody. I have even encouraged a few people to buy a Jeep, but this is a rip-off. Everyday factory workers can’t afford over a thousand dollars to replace these windows.",
"I bought my 2006 Jeep Liberty used at 43,000. After driving it off the lot 5 days, a window regulator broke on it. Cost me over $300.00, which they told me I had to buy the window also. That was March 2009. So December 2009 a second regulator goes bad. The dealer tells me that they have had some problems with them and Chrysler will pay half. I was happy about that, but now 4 months later the window regulator breaks again. This time the dealer knows nothing and can't help me. 
      He doesn't believe that it has happened again but when I get there they bring a bulletin in that says it may be a recall soon, look at my car and then they send me home telling me I have to wait for a part. This is so wrong. They know it is faulty and should be paid by them, not me. They keep breaking every few months and it costs a bundle. I don't have $300.00 plus bucks to fork out every few months. Chrysler needs to step up and fix this problem! The consequence is a lot of money shelled out to Chrysler and I am sure they hike the repair costs up too.",
"A few months ago, my 2009 Jeep Liberty's tachometer surged to 2,000 RPM while stopped and foot on brake. This has happened four different times now while stopped and foot on the brake. I took it into my Jeep dealer and they could not figure out the problem and told me to come back in if it happens again.",
"On May 3, 2010, I was on my way home from work when my accelerator pedal stuck. I tapped it to get it unstuck which threw the car in super fast acceleration which careened my car over an embankment which only stopped when I hit a tree. I suffered a severe hematoma of the skull, concussion, severe bruising, which to this day I still have a black eye and suffer severe headaches. 
      The car’s air bags never deployed. The jeep overturned when hitting the tree. If these air bags had deployed, I believe I would not have sustained the trauma to my body, especially my head, as I did. Upon investigation, I see that the jeeps have had acceleration problems for years. I paid the consequences when my car’s accelerator stuck and on release threw me into an embankment. My head injuries were the worse. I still suffer from severe headaches. I lost a car, my air bags did not deploy, I lost 2 weeks of work of which I should have listened to my body and stayed off more, but economically I could not, especially having to purchase a car. I feel Chrysler/Jeep Corp. should be held responsible for this accident! Mentally, I have a fear of getting behind the wheel again even though this was not of my doing. I am extremely stressed over this situation and would like answers!",
"I have owned my 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport for almost 4 years. I have had to replace the motor on the rear windows 4 times. The rear driver side window 3 times and passenger side once. Although Jeep has picked up the cost one time, I have been responsible for the other times. I am currently in debate over this fourth window. I refuse to pay for it! My window is down and my car is not secure. It is over 100 degrees on a daily basis. My AC goes right out the window.",
"I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty (Limited) and a 2007 Jeep Liberty. Three windows have dropped in the 2007 Liberty, with less than 10,000 miles on it. The two back windows on the 2006 Jeep just dropped within days of each other (and these windows were rarely used!) last week. I have read of many who have experienced this same problem. Jeep should be held accountable for this obvious defect. My window dropped while parked at a mall and I was lucky no one stole some items of value inside.",
"Om 5/13/2010, we were driving our 2006 Jeep Liberty. As we slowed for a red light (foot off the accelerator and applying the brakes), the engine suddenly revved and the car lunged forward. It only lasted a few seconds and traffic was light so there was no damage and nobody got hurt. We had been using cruise control earlier. It felt like a glitch with that system.",
"My 2007 Jeep Commander engine stalls out in the middle of driving and the service technicians claim to have no idea what is wrong with it or how to resolve. However, in doing my own research, there appears to be multiple issues with Jeep engines stalling and in some cases has resulted in recalls for reprogramming of the software. This has not trickled down to my 2007 Commander yet.",
"My window regulator broke on my 2004 Jeep Liberty. Apparently this is a common problem. I was unable to buy the broken part anywhere, believe me I scoured. Why? This is because Jeep has redesigned the broken part, forcing me to buy new window glass. If their new design didn't go with the existing window, they should replace the window at their own cost. 
      They admitted their design was defective by virtue of replacing the whole system, that's their problem and shouldn't be mine. The dealer is charging me over $500, the broken part used to cost $80. I have no choice. The window broke and fell down into the door.I think we're ready for a class-action suit against Jeep. First, for making a defective part knowingly and then charging me for additional parts because they couldn't design it right the second time.",
"The side windows, driver’s side front and rear windows and the front passenger window have failed. The driver’s window has failed for the third time and I rarely use the windows. The front passenger window is now taped up. I do not have the free time it takes to keep taking the Liberty into the shop to have the windows repaired especially when they will break again in a short period of time. I am thinking of permanently siliconing them shut.",
"I purchased a 2009 Jeep Patriot on 1/30/09. It has been in repair 5 times for stalling issues. It continues to stall, corporate customer assistance refused to discuss lemon law or arbitration or advise me on any other way to pursue the problem. I am paying $370.17 per month for a vehicle I am afraid to drive and be rear ended after several close calls. This has caused emotional stress, time to take car to dealer and financial obligation for vehicle with great potential for doing me bodily harm.",
"My 2005 Jeep Liberty was not starting. I turn the key and the dash lights would come on but no ignition. I thought perhaps it was the ignition switch. When my mechanic was disassembling my ignition, two metal pieces fell out of the switch. These pieces were the tip of the ignition rod the that fits into the ignition switch to turn the vehicle on. With this broken, the ignition switch can not be turned. The rod is approximately 3 inches long, very easy to access and easy to replace. 
      The only problem is that this part is not available. I have to buy the whole steering column for $374. This part is poorly made and appears to be a weak design. After investigating via internet, it appears to be a very common failure. I just wish that this part would be available or a new design made. As of now, I have to start my Jeep with a screw driver. I know it's not a safety issue but how does one go about getting a recall? Everything works on my steering column so I just think it is unnecessary to replace the whole thing. The part should be available!",
"I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty and have had to replace my window regulator switches about 8 times now and currently, I have two broken windows but was quoted $350, plus tax for each window to be replaced from Chrysler dealership located at Superstation Springs in Mesa AZ. As you can imagine, I don't want to pay $700 for something I know is just going to break again. I have asked them to ask the manufacturer for a discount. Basically, I don't feel that this part should continuously break and consumers should have to keep paying for something over and over and over again. I have owned my Jeep for almost 6 years now. Thank you.",
"I have been a loyal Jeep owner for ten years. This is my third jeep, and I love them, even though I could have bought another vehicle that had better gas mileage. In three years, I have had to take my 2006 Liberty into the shop 4 times for a bad window regulator on three different windows. Each time, I was covered under warranty. (I think Jeep knew this was a problem for many owners.) But now, I was told that it would cost me ""at least $470,"" and the guy never even looked at my car. 
      I told them that this particular window was already repaired, but he said I would still be responsible for the repair fee. I've been looking online, and there a hundreds of complaints about faulty window regulators. Chrysler is in the toilet right now, and they really can't afford to lose people like me. If there is a class action suit against Jeep, count me in. This should definitely be a recall. Shame on you, Chrysler. I will never buy another Jeep again.",
"Two years ago this march, I purchased a used 2007 Jeep Liberty. The jeep has a little over 46,000 miles and the engine is shot. It was nothing I did. I kept my maintenance up to date. My three year warranty has expired and the five year power train warranty did not transfer since I'm second owner. I wasn't made aware of this detail. I still owe about $14,000 on vehicle. I purchased it from Preston Hyundai 260 Boardman, Ohio. They were no help at all when I gave Jeep my VIN number. I need advice. The repair cost is $3500 and I am a divorced mother of four. Is there anything that I can do about thi?",
"I bought a Jeep Liberty in April of 2007, and every year, one of my window regulators goes out. Now, I am sitting with 3 broken windows. It is going to cost me about $800.00 to fix them. I looked in your website, and saw that there are many individuals with the same problem. Why can't Jeep just recall the part? We pay good money for these cars.",
"We bought our 2006 Jeep Liberty Renegade under a year ago with 32,000 miles on it. Two days after driving off the lot, the rear driver side window went out. The dealership replaced this free of charge, which we are very grateful for. Now almost six months later, the passenger rear window has gone out. Right now, it is duct taped up to prevent rain and debris from coming into the jeep. However, we are not able to drive it anywhere because every tiny bump will knock it back down. I contacted Jeep and they seem willing to reimburse us, however, it's going to cost us anywhere from $350 on up to fix and this is out of our pocket. We are a military family and do not make that much to begin with. My question is why can't the Jeep dealer just fix it and discuss financial options within their own company? 
      I've read quite a bit on this issue on various consumer websites. Everyone is having this problem. It is a defect in the windows and Jeep should be made accountable for it! Instead, we are all paying out of pocket expenses, with a verbal agreement for reimbursement which who knows if we will actually get this. I really like my Jeep, however, with these little problems, I seriously doubt I will ever own one again.",
"I was driving my 2008 Jeep Rubicon on highway I96 about 25 miles south of Grand Rapids, MI. All of a sudden, I heard a ""whoosh!"" I stopped my Jeep. The driver-side, rear side window, which is part of the roof, popped off and shattered on the highway. A lost window is to be replaced. I lost faith in my vehicle. We bought an extended warranty. At first, the dealership wasn't going to replace the window because glass isn't covered under warranty. We argued and won. We now pay the $100 deductible. But I want to document this with someone. The window just popping off is a concern. What if someone had been beside my Jeep? It could have been fatal.",
"We purchased a new 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee and after we had about 35000 miles on it, we were driving down the expressway at 70 mph and the engine started to race to 7000 rpm, wna continued when the brakes were pressed.  I had to turn the key off and try to pull over with no power steering.  
      The dealers have never been able to find a problem and it has happened 10 to 15 times in many different cases.  Sometimes even when at a stoplight with foot on the break, it happens.  It sounds like the same problem that others have had.  There is no damage yet and I have been able to turn the engine off when it happens so far, but we will not sell this jeep to anyone because of this problem.",
"I had an unexplained acceleration on my 2007 Jeep Commander, with 6000 miles on it. The car was totaled. I'm alive, but terrified of driving. Multiple calls to Chrysler, denied me release of inspection reports. I was told that I would be provided same only by engaging an attorney or by virtue of my hiring an attorney. Everything I have read for the past number of days about Toyota, makes me convinced that I have been badly misled and hurt by Chrysler. Brand new car totaled. Damage to property. Extreme mental anguish.",
"This is to let you that my 1994 grand Jeep limited is the best jeep in the world! It has 335569 miles on it and is still running the best ever, sure it has some issues, but they are only minor. I hate that Chrysler is having a hard time right now but you have a great product and I just wanted you to hear it from a person who would loves her Jeep and as long as I can drive a Jeep, I will. 
      If I keep it serviced, it should last me until I can afford to buy another one. I am a small business owner and my Jeep is my life saver. It gets me to work in the snow and all kinds of weather and I love it. So keep your head up and the good Lord willing it will be okay. Thanks for having a great Jeep! Keep up the good work!",
"My problem is with the manufacturer. I have had all four windows fixed under warranty. When the 5th window broke again, it was past the warranty. By the way, the 3rd and 4th window being fixed, the manufacturer sent an alert to dealers about how to fix the windows properly. This mean my first 3 windows were not fixed properly. 
      Anyway, I went around and around with the manufacturer rep (because he is only the speaker and can't negotiate) we got no where. To me, it's the principle of the matter to be fair. I have been a loyal customer of two jeeps. I guess my customer satisfaction is not worth paying to fix my window properly. I will never purchase another Jeep because of this experience.",
"Jeeps obviously have a window regulator problem. I have had two breaks on my Jeep already and there are many forums out there speaking about this as well as petition sites. I spoke to Jeep the first time and they paid half for a problem they caused. That is so unfair and now they want me to get the second window inspected at my expense for them to even talk to me. We all know warranty runs out and what it covers, but when a product is manufactured defective like this why can they not take ownership and fix it? The dealers will tell you there is a problem. I’m a frustrated Jeep owner.",
"When our vehicle was barely 3 years old and just past the warranty cut, the mechanism for our driver's rear window went out. It would no longer function or even hold in an upright position. The price to replace the mechanism was beyond our means, so we tied the window up. Then within a year, the rear passenger window also went out. Now a third window in our vehicle has given out. These are all clearly made with faulty materials but the company refuses to recall the part or repair it because it is out of the 3-year warranty zone.",
"The regulators in my 2006 Jeep Renegade are broke. I had two replaced regulators at a Chrysler Dealership and they are now broke again. I only have 1 window that operates now. When the regulators are broke, all a thief has to do is press down on the broken window and break into my vehicle. When is there going to be a recall on this matter.",
Call dodge about the rear axle seal that leaks after it has been fix. They told me that it's not their problem. I told them this is my second time fixing the same problem. I need them to recall my 2004 jeep so that they fix it.,
"A few months ago I began noticing that about once a week while driving the tachometer would suddenly begin revving while driving. Finally the check engine light came on. We had autozone reset it and when we unplugged and replugged the sensor it seemed to work fine. In the past two weeks, while stopped at a red light or stop sign, with my foot securely on the break, the jeep has suddenly accelerated and lurched forward. Each time has been a little worse. I am wondering at what point I should take it into a dealership. If they are going to charge me a fortune and there appears to be no fix, what is the point? I am terrified to drive my jeep.",
"I own a 2006 Jeep Commander. I have experienced stalling two times while driving down the highway. While driving along, the car turned off leaving me with no steering control. I had to put the car in park, turn it off and re-start the car. This weekend, I was involved in a four car accident because the Jeep failed to slow down with me pressing on the brakes as hard as I could. I had not experienced any previous problems with the brakes and had just slowed down a minute or two earlier. Traffic slowed down and the car in front of me braked. I attempted to brake, pushing as hard as I could but my car did not slow down. The result was a four car chain reaction collision. I was charged with failure to slow down.",
"My parents bought me a demo 2006 Jeep Liberty in 2006 when I was 16. It had just under 500 miles on it. Within the first 6 months, the window made a grinding sound and then fell down. The dealership replaced it. Just shy of my warranty expiring, I had two more windows break in the same way. My father forced the dealership to change all of the regulators to ensure this problem wouldn't happen again. Just a few months ago, I had another window break. I was just out of the time warranty but under the mile warranty but that didn't help me. The dealership told me they couldn't fix it without ordering a new window, that cost me $400. They also charged me $182 for their service. 
      It was just under $600 for a problem that is widespread in all 2006 Jeep Liberties. The man working at the dealership told me this is a huge problem that Chrysler is ignoring. I am a college student, I can not afford to dish out $600 every few months to fix a poor-quality manufacturing part. Replacing the regulators is not working. I am living proof to that. Chrysler needs to recall this model and make.",
"Specifically, this is the worst Jeep I have ever owned and I have owned 4 other Jeeps. The light on the dash board that indicates problems with the tires stays on constantly. In fact, this past August I went for my yearly sticker and the intake worker, Courtney, at Grava Chrysler/Jeep said they could not give me a sticker unless I got two brand new tires for the rear. 
      Because the tire light was constantly on, I thought the new tires would correct the constant light. The car had about 21K miles on it. I don't drive all that much. I purchased the Commander for peace of mind in the winter months. The replaced tires were the original tires. So I paid $300.00 for two new tires to get a sticker and to hopefully make the dashboard light go out. I haven't gotten a mile with the new tires when the dashboard tire light turned back on. There is also a problem with the air conditioning motor according to Courtney at Grava Chrysler/Jeep. I have tried to have this problem rectified, but both times, Courtney told me the part was on order and she would call me when the part came in. When I checked back with her, the part hadn't come in and she stated that she would re-order it. I never got her call so my air conditioning/heating unit in the Commander still sounds like it has gravel in it. My most pressing problem right now is the on and off stalling of the engine. I can get in the car and start her up and drive to the store. I'll come out of the store and the car won't start. When this stalling occurs, it seems as though whatever was wrong corrects itself because the car will start after sitting for a couple of hours. Meanwhile, depending on where I am, I have to either walk home, have someone pick me up or take a taxi home leaving the car where it is. This has happened on numerous occasions and is still happening.In fact, when I go to the store, the doctor, etc. I either leave the car running with the doors locked so that I won't get stranded or I leave it home and take a taxi. The last car stalling event took place yesterday, 1/5/10. I took my grandson to school in Revere, MA., the next town over. The car started fine. But when I tried to start the car after dropping my grandson off, it wouldn't start. There I sat in 20 degree weather in a stalled car. I finally walked to my daughters house about a 1/4 mile away. I have called AAA on a couple of occasions when the car stalled. The tow truck driver said it's probably my starter. I recently read about the problems other folks are having with this stalling issue. Believe it or not, I thought I was the only one experiencing this problem. My Jeep has not stalled on me while I was driving. When I first got the car there was a seat belt recall, but that was completed.",
"The jeep windows drop and shatter; the cheap plastic parts they used will not hold up. I googled the problem, it is widespread. There should be a recall.",
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty had windows that fail to stay up and the regulator is bad. We had the rear windows (both) repaired sometime in middle of the year. Now, front driver window fell while I was driving down on the freeway to Sacto. Talk about a cold surprise! I stopped at my mom's house to try and fix with pliers and duct tape. I got the window up, but it was not fixed. I see forums about regulators failing at a regular rate. It seems to be a major flaw with the design and there should be a recall to fix massive problems with the windows. Where is product/manufacture value if it does not last?",
"This year alone I've had four window regulator replacements, on top of the long list of replacements I've already had. Both of my rear window regulators went out in February and were replaced. The rear driver one was replaced again around August. At this time, I was assured that the part problem had been fixed and there would be no further problems. Needless to say, I just had the forth replacement this December. Guess the problem isn't any closer to be fixed. I park on the street and the window regulators just break. My car is sitting out there with an open window, that I know nothing about until the next time that I go somewhere. 
      During the last repair, my service adviser asked how I liked my Liberty. My answer was I own a Jeep 4x4 that can't go off road because a window regulator will fall and I'll get another repair bill. What is the point of having a 4x4 that can only be on the pavement and even at that, the windows still give out? I believe that this last regulator replacement made number 12. When is someone going to hold Jeep accountable for this?",
"Today (Dec. 17, 2009) the passenger rear window on my 2007 Jeep Liberty fell. I am unsure if the regulator is broken. Tomorrow I will open the door and see the damage and try and replace it myself. After reading these posts, I am sure the regulator is broken, but I do not know if I will have to purchase the new style regulator. Is the old style still available to purchase? I'll find out. Well obviously, paying $400+ per window every time they fail (and they will fail) is unacceptable. Why can't we all just write one letter - everyone sign it who is having issues and send the letter to Chrysler/Jeep for resolution? If they do not, we all take them to court and force them to fix the issue. We can't simply allow them to continue to ignore this issue.",
"Two passenger regulators have broken on my 2006 Jeep Liberty. I am required to replace not only the regulators but the perfectly fine glass. Clearly Jeep has a design flaw with the glass/regulator system. Customers should not be forced to pick up the tab. The repairs are costing me over $400 per window! The regulators themselves are only about $150, but why I need to spend over $200 per window when my windows are intact is beyond me. I am paying over $800 to fix two window regulators and replacement glass as Jeep has changed the glass and regulator system of my 2006 Jeep Liberty.",
Electric window regulator is defective and has been a constant problem for thousands of Jeep owners. I just replaced mine for $357.08 at dealership.,
"Back in 2007, when my Jeep Liberty CRD diesel (a 2006 model) was under warranty,  the check engine light came off and some code was pulled from the computer about a problem with Turbo charger inlet pressure sensor. I was not told to replace anything and they blamed the computer for the problem. Now it's 2009 and I have my Jeep taken care of at the Bellevue, WA dealer and I have spent about $2000 already, replacing parts to fix the same issue that was coming up back in 2007. The problem is that, of course, my warranty has ended so I have to pay this all out of my pocket. I have receipts that state the computer in the car was coming up with the issue back in 2007. I think it's totally unfair. It was obviously something that came out wrong from the factory or that I could have fixed while under warranty.",
I just talked to a friend of ours who said her Jeep window will not go up or down. We have a Jeep Grand Cherokee that has 3 windows that will not go up or down.,
"We have a 2003 and a 2006 Jeep Liberty and both have had windows fall down due to the faulty regulator.  I called Chrysler when the second one occurred (just before Thanksgiving) and waas told I had to take it in to be ""diagnosed"" first, then I'd hear back from them in 24 hours.  So they force me to make 2 trips to the Jeep place since they wouldn't approve the repair on the spot.  Oh, and when they did call back, they want me to pay $150.00 towards the repair and they'll pick up the rest.  Chrysler needs to be sued as it is clear that they aren't going to voluntarily issue a recall.  And I am not even convinced that they have actually ""fixed"" the problem as there are people who have had the same window regulator replaced multiple times.",
"We bought our 2006 Jeep Liberty new in June of 2006.  This is an all-terrain vehicle that should hold up to about anything...So we thought.  Within the first six months we had to have the driver's side window repaired - the regulator.  A year later our second regulator went out on the rear drivers side.  Thankfully it was under warranty...but we now realize that it was fixed under the old way...and will probably go out again...and probably soon.  Six months ago and our mileage is at 39000 miles...3000 over the warranty...our 3rd window regulator broke...and since it wasn't under warranty anymore...and we were told, under the new redesign of Chrysler Jeep's initial design problem...we will have to not only replace the regulator but the perfectly good window as well...$460.00 out of our pocket...and in these times...money we don't have...and shouldn't have to pay to replace something that should last the life of the vehicle...this is ridiculous...a design problem that obviously they realized was a problem and are making the consumer (the ones that buy their vehicles) pay for.  And to top it all off...My fourth window regulator just broke tonight...less than 3 weeks before Christmas and I now have to pay for a new window.  We used to love our Jeep but have now decided that if this issue is not resolved and corrected by Chrysler Jeep, we will trade in our Jeep on a new (non-Chrysler) vehicle and will never buy one again...I would really like to continue buying Chrysler Jeeps, so please resolve this issue.",
Window regulator needs replaced on 2005 Jeep Liberty.  This is a manufacturer defect and a recall needs to be ordered for the thousands of consumers forced to spend millions of dollars in a repair that is clearly the company's fault.,
"An update on my post from a month or so ago.  When I called Chrysler customer relations, the gentleman was nice, I wasn't as pleasant after I was told the day before by Chrysler that a service warranty bought on my 2006 Jeep Liberty by the previous owner would cover the $365.  When I took my jeep into the dealer to fix the window regulator problem I was told it wasn't covered.  I asked to talk to the customer relations supervisor.  He told me that wasn't necessary and I said it was.   Surprisingly, I received a call back from the resolution dispute department the next day.  He told me Chrysler would reimburse me $130.  This tells me that Chrysler is making nearly $200 or more profit each time they replace the window regulator and a new window.  I received a call yesterday (December 3 )telling me that Chrysler is going to pay me $230, I need to call them back still.",
I have had to replace 3 window regulators on my 2007 Jeep Liberty and it turns out so has everone else who own one. it is very expensive and this should be a recall.,
"As you might already heard, i'm just complaining about the Jeep Liberty.  I've had the window regulator replaced 4 times, once last year, and 3 times this year.  Will Chrysler take any responsibilty.  i have warranty but i'm afraid that when its over, i'll have the same problem and it going to cost me a lot.

"The windows on My Jeep Liberty have gone out 6 times since I bought it new in May 2006.  It is not covered under warrantee any more.  I paid for the last one about 3 months ago.  

                            
                                
      Since I drove the car off the lot the pattern is is that every 3 months a window regulator goes out.
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        Mr. Sommers told me a few years ago that this was a design problem and that they were trying to fix it.",
We purchased a brand new 2006 Jeep Liberty June of 2006.  Since then we have had to replace 5 window regulators.  Now that our warranty has run out of course the 6th one has now gone out.  I have been reading complaint after complaint on this website of coutless people going through the same thing.  It's an outrage.  This is a defect.  Jeep knows this is happening and has since corrected the problem but what about us who have to either try to never use our windows or pay outlandish prices every 6 months to fix yet another one that has already been fixed twice.  Why can't anything be done about this?,
"We bought a 2007 Jeep Liberty with less than 12000 miles on it for our daughter to take to college. We purchased it from a Chrysler/Jeep Dealer. Since we purchased it, the windoew regulator in the left rear window has broken and had to be replaced twice. The right rear has had to be replace once. Now the left front window is down and will not go up.",
I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty new. I liked it until I had to bring it to replace the window regulators. I had to replace 2 of them the first year and one the second year. I saw a future of problems with the car after an additional 3 recalls. The reason I am complaining is about the window regulators. I found out nothing was done for the consumer even though the regulators keep breaking. I have a friend who also has the same issue. He has replaced 5 window regulators since he owned his Liberty. I think he is going to fill out this same form. His name is Robert Rivas.,
"I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty that I purchased used in February of 2008.  For the most part, I was happy with the vehicle to begin with.  Then My left rear window suddenly would not go up or down anymore.  I took it to the dealership and was told that it was the regulator that had broken and that it was not covered under any regulator.  So $233.00 with the part and labor included, it was fixed.  This was about a year ago.  Last week the right rear window did the same thing.  Since I did not have an extra $233 just lying around to fix it, I duck taped it so it would at least be closed until I could fix it.  Imagine that, Duck tape on a 3 year old vehicle!!!!!!!  Then yesterday, as I am looking for a second job to help pay for my vehicle expenses (I need 2 new tires as well), the right driver's side window does the same thing!!!  Only this time, I can't duck tape it because it is too heavy to stay up.  So, I drive to the dealership, which was closing in 10 minutes.  The guy looks at it and trys to get it to stay up at least until monday.  I ask about the price, just to see if it had changed at all since the last time I had this done. Turns out, the Jeep people decided that it was necessary to upgrade the regulator so it will not fit my current window.  So now, I have to replace the regulator and the window!!!  How much with that be?  $350 for parts and then another $200 for labor and taxes!  $550 just for the one window!  What the real kicker in all of this is, is the fact that the Jeep dealerships all say that this is a common problem in the Libertys.  However, there has been no recall or announcement of the defect by jeep.  So I'm supposed to just deal with every regulator breaking as it happens because Jeep made regulators that don't stand up to every day use????",
"I purchased a 2006 Jeep Liberty and we've had problems with the window regulators on all of the windows.  I noticed other Jeep Liberty owners on this forum have had the same problem.  My Jeep is in the shop this morning and they told me the same thing that the regulator has been upgraded and you need a new window to get the upgraded regulator. Chrysler hasn't heard the last from me on this.  It's going to cost more than $300 to repair.  There should have been a recall on this.  Chrysler I hope you enjoyed your government bailout, but I will no longer buy another one of your products!",
"We are leasing an 07 Jeep Commander which has unexpected stalling.  Stalls occur at various speeds without any indicator light appearing while driving at any speed i.e. highway or urban driving.  This has occurred +/- 5 times over the last year.  Jeep has been to dealership shop where several, yet unsure, reasons have been cited including but not limited to:  shift module component, necessary upgrade to shift module software, low transmission fluid level.  Suspect repairs were made, however, stalling occurred once again.",
"After owning my 2007 Jeep Liberty for 2+ years, two window regulators, front passenger and rear drivers side, have broke allowing the windows to suddendly drop.",
Just want to inform others to stay away from 2009 Jeep Liberty. I have been back to the dealer about a high speed shimmy three times. Have been told that they all have a slight shimmy at high speeds. In other words live with it. One tech explained that its probably coming from the torque converter. I think this a common problem with other Jeep vehicles.,
"I have replaced the window regluator on my 2006 jeep liberty 4 times already and went in for 5th time 10/17. The dealer refused to honor the ext warranty and replace it again unless I buy a new window for the door, meaning i will new to buy 4 windows as each regulator fails again",
"Today (10/15/09) will be the 9th time that I have had the regulator replaced in my 2006 Jeep Liberty.  A car that I purchased used (9,000 miles @ 1 yr).  So, 2.5 years later & out of warranty, I am now having to ""negotiate"" a lower service price with a Chrysler spokesperson.  She informed me today that I will pay for a diagnostic test & small co-pay.  Hello - the problem is the regulator - what diagnosis?  Not to mention that I'm unemployed & have to drive 45 minutes to get this fixed.  This is a defective part!!!  I hope this goes to class action.  Please help!!!",
I purchased a 2009 Jeep Patriot and have owned it for 2 months and have water pouring in like a small river from the overhead dome light.  Went to a Jeep forum and was dumb founded on how many people have had the same problem and how many times that they have had to go to dealers to have the problem keep coming back.  Disappointed.,
"I Have a 2006 Jeep Commander now at 34,000 miles, I will be driving and have had the vehicle shut down with no power, this has happened multiple times on the freeway and on the streets, last time was making a left hand turn and stalled in front of oncoming traffic was able to restart but now getting to the point where I am scared to drive, I have taking the unit into the dealer several times, the first time they replaced a steering module and still problem the second time taking in kept it for about 5 days and nothing was found, I am a good customer that pays all car payments on time never late, The people at the dealership state they no that there is a problem and told me all I could do is report it to Chrysler as there is nothing they can do, I have done allot of research and have found allot of people with the same problem that I am having with my jeep, What is it going to take to get this issue fixed? Is there going to have to be multiple deaths do to this problem? I am also going to file with national highway and safety, I guess I should call my insurance company as well so that they are aware of the problem, I hope this will fix this, I guess next time I will not buy an American product very disappointed.",
"I purchased a 2006 Jeep Liberty in December of 2006... I'm gonna try to be as nice as I can. But within the first year the window regulator went out, it was replaced a few months later the second regulator went out and it was fixed then the third and it was fixed.  Now today 10/09 the first one has gone out again. And wouldn't you know my warranty is out.  I did purchase the extended warranty which will cover the regulator after a $100 ded is paid. But here is the kicker....Crysler has finally recongnized there is a problem and has redesigned the regulator, which now does not match up with the orginal factory window!!! and they will not cover it...They want the consumer who has taken off many hours of work drove 30 miles and wasted most of the day to have the other 4 fixed to pay for that window!!! Is Crysler a IDIOT!!!! or what.... I asked the service manager why do you think the redesigned the regulator and he said"" I assume it was because of all the problems and complaints""  Well you would think that if they redisigned the regulator they would eat the cost of the window  dud?  This is our government own Auto factory at work going to hell in a handbag!!!!! I am suprised anyone would buy a Jeep product if they read this web site.. I just got through reading at least 50 complaints with the windows and I stopped, there was 84 pages.... Why will Crysler Not DO A RECALL and quite putting their stupid mistake on the consumer back!!! People can't afford this now days!!!!!! They should be forced to eat the windows as many as there is that has paid to have them replaced.... I will close with this!!! I have driven a FORD Product since I was 16 years old!!! Until I bought this Jeep Product!!! I can promise you this I will NEVER buy another JEEP Product!!!!!And I will tell everyone I know about this issue...If I had the time I would stand in front of the dealership with a sign that read!!""DON""T BUY CRYSLER PRODUCT IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE AND A GOOD PRODUCT, CAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET EITHER HERE!!! IF YOU BUY THEIR PRODUCT YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!!!!GET READY TO PAY PAY PAY!!!!!",
MY left rear window regulator gave causing my window to drop into door.  I have read numerous complaints about this happens multiple times. It should be a recall.  I can't afford to have it fixed once let alone having to worry about all four windows.,
"2006 Jeep Liberty - I bought this car in Dec 2008 used.  Thought I got a great deal, NOT!  I have owned this thing for 10 months and in that time, I have 3 electric windows with bad regulators!

"My parents own a 2006 Jeep Liberty. 2 of the windows were not going up and down properly. The dealer said the regulators were bad but in order to replace the regulators, we also have to replace the windows because the new regulators will not mount to the original ones. So not only do they have to buy new windows that there is nothing wrong with, they will also have the new windows tinted due to the fact that they paid to have the original windows tinted to help reduce the heat.",
"Owner of a 2003 Jeep Liberty.  I have experienced multiple incidences of the vehicle skidding out of lane on damp or wet roads.  Skidding has occured when Jeep was negotiating a right curve and going uphill, even slightly.  Low rate of speed and vehicle goes out of control. Recently Jeep skidded when on access ramp to a highway, went completely out of control, nearly causing serious accident. Grace of God that no other vehicles were nearby, as my Jeep slid onto left lane and back over to my lane and off shoulder and over a curb. Very scary as this skidding happens with no logical explanation nor warning.",
"I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty in February 2007 and little did I know I was fixing to have to spend a fortune replacing window regulators,after reading all these other complaints,I think I need to add my story.And also want to know why this is not a recall on this product,now days and time it takes all my money to make ends meet and now I am faced with replacing another regulator for the fifth time in two yr..First one went out in June 2007,I had it replaced at a local dealership for just over 500.00..That was hard to come up with,but I managed,okay thinking I would make the rest of the yr. without having to replace any more,wrong,July 2007 another one went out,so I go online and try to figure out how to replace them since it looked as if I was fixing to have to do this alot,all was well in the replacement of that one,was alot cheaper since I ordered the parts online.Mean time I still have a monthly note on this Jeep.2008 rolls around and in april another one goes out sitting in a parking lot and fell down.so here I go again,ordered more parts and replacement windows since I was told they changed the design to work with a certain window,more expensive but still cheaper doing it myself.lucked out in 2008 and only changed out one,2009 March here goes another one out,here I go again spending extra money on what seems like a default other than my own..And now sept.2009 am back to replacing the very first one I had replaced in 2007 at my dealership..It is obvious there is a very big problem here with these regulators,and so far it has cost me $1100.00,give or take a few bucks.Am fixing to order another one and the price of it from two yrs. ago has gone up 39.00..This is just a little something for Chrysler to chew on since they will not make a recall on thes Jeeps,one thing is for sure,as soon as I fix it I am fixing to replace the Jeep with another make and model..I will do more research this time so I want have this problem again..Thank you,Bobby",
"I also have a recurring problem with the window regulators on my 2005 Jeep Liberty. As of this letter, I have had 3 regulators fail, only 1 of which I have been able to afford to replace. We live in the desert, so we don't have much reason to roll our windows down. They just begin to slowly sag. I find it infuriating that I have read through the other letters of complaint on this web site, and I counted more than 50 letters referring to this exact same problem, and yet Jeep hasn't announced a recall for this obviously faulty part.

I have a 2003 Jeep Liberty and I have replaced the rear window regulators 6 times on each window that's a total of 12 times. I havnt paid for most of them to be replaced because i Complain to Jeep. The problem I have is the inconveince of having to take it to the dealer every 6 months and the constant complaining to the dealer and Jeep back and forth. I have to do everything call Jeep and then the dealer.. You think the dealer would do this for me. So recently I decided to buy aheavy duty aftermarket piece that replaces the faulty part. Hopfully I won't have to deal with this problem ever again.,
"both of my passenger back windows have fallen down inside the panel. both window regulators have broken. my jeep is only  3yrs. old. the cost is about 381.00 to fixed each one. There is no more warrenty on my vehicle. if there is a defect, why isn't chrysler fixing this? This not my fault.",
"I have had to replace three window regulators ($1200) and the mechanic tells me I will have to replace the last one eventually.  He says the part is faulty and there is nothing they can do about it.  Problem is, we never even used the back windows. They just fall down without any warning.  My front seat rack will have to be replaced as well, because the part has worn out to move it back and forth and up and down.  Price quoted for that is $625.00.",
I got this jeep 4 months ago just made my 3rd paynent I know there was sold as is no warranty was driving home last week at night and the tranmission came out of it had to get it towed and the jeep company at mount airy nc advised it would take 3885.00 to get a new one and for the labor but my opinion warranty or not it should have last longer than 34 months,

"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty on 7/22/07. Since that time, I have had to have the power window regulator replaced on 3 of 4 windows, one window needing to be replaced twice. Fortunately for me, the vehicle is still under warranty. I have reviewed the complaints on consumeraffairs.com and see that this is a very common problem. The service adviser at my local Jeep dealership, Moore Chrysler/Jeep in Peoria, Arizona shrugged it off, telling me ""Oh, yeah, that's a real common problem"". I am concerned that when my warranty runs out, this will be a continuing problem. I had intended to keep this vehicle for the long term and am disappointed that Jeep does not seem to be concerned about this. This is potentially very costly. Is there any recourse for Liberty owners? I can see that this could potentially be a safety issue. One would think that Jeep would not treat this as lightly as they obviously are.",
"While stopped at a red light, the engine revved up and the car jumped forward, hitting the car in front even though I applied the brake. My Jeep Grand Cherokee suffered heavy front damage and the other car was badly damaged in the rear. Our insurance covered most of the cost.",
"I bought a new Jeep Liberty Sport 2002 in January 2002. Ever since I got this vehicle, until now, it's been one problem after the other resulting in my complete dissatisfaction. I thought I had purchased a new car, but I think I would have been better off buying a used car. I'm sure it wouldn't had been as much of a hassle as this new car has been. The biggest problem this car had (among many others) was right when I bought it. In California, the beginning of the year, it's rainy season. Well it turns out my car wouldn't stop completely on wet ground/pavement. It will slide forward and not only that, but it will fishtail meaning when breaking, it will go left and right. You can imagine how scary that is. 
      I've been almost involved in 2 accidents because of this defect - one driving on the street and one on the freeway. I went back to the dealer twice. I explained what had happened and on both occasions. I was told to come back when it was raining so they could see what I was talking about! Can you believe that? With all the frustration, I went back when it was raining and until then they agreed to fix it. I can't tell you enough how much of a nightmare my experience has been with this vehicle.",
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Liberty and have owned it one year. The window regulator went out, and now, they want to replace it at my cost. And the window too went out ($450). If this was faulty regulator (There are many postings.), why is this not a recall? I am 83 years old and felt this was a safe vehicle. The warranty wasn't good, up to 36000 miles; and now, I have 43,000. Is this a money-maker?",
"The other day, I was pulling out of the Neptune Post office parking lot. I had put my car in reverse to back out. When I put the car in drive, the engine revved up and it shot forward like a torpedo, broadsiding a parked car and starting to climb an embankment. The police officer accused me of lying, and issued me a careless driving summons. My airbags never opened. I had scheduled an appointment to have my Jeep's electronic system checked because my power windows and locks were working off and on, and the interior lights would not go off automatically. After looking at all the postings on this sudden acceleration, I am sure that my Jeep had malfunctioned. How can I prove it though?",
"Well, I have a 2008 Jeep Liberty and it came to my surprise of only having it 18 months, the driver's side window wouldn't go up. I couldn't believe it. I took it to the dealership who said it will cost $270 to fix. I said, ""Oh my gosh, I can't believe it. It's just a 2008 model. I expect it to last longer than this."" Anyway, I'm still going around with the regulator not fixed. Could I sue the company if something awful happens? If Chrysler knew about this, why don't they fix it or recall them especially when someone gets a new one? This is ridiculous.",
"I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty. The window regulators have to be replaced almost every year. I took the vehicle in to two different dealerships when it was under warranty and they said no problem found. Since the warranty has been out, I have replaced four or five times now. This is a very dangerous situation because the window just falls - if you're going down the road, it is startling and the thump thump of the rear tires can really hurt your ears. When this happens, the car is not secure and you must have it fixed immediately.",
"This problem is all over the internet. The 2004 Jeep Liberty started having problems with windows falling down within one year of purchase. It has been ""fixed"" at least once a year or more since then. Last time, it was only six months. This is unacceptable to me as I purchased a new vehicle to minimize the occurrence of vehicle failure and unforeseen interruptions of use. When this occurs, vacations (road trips) are ruined. Rain and other weather enters the vehicle. It cannot be secured and you have to drive around, unable to secure your vehicle. It is difficult even to drive home on the freeway but also unsafe to take side streets, etc. during evening hours. It is basically just a pain and I do not understand how, in five years, Jeep has not been able to figure out how to solve this problem. It is like an additional source of income to them, so I guess they have no reason to.",
The window regulators keep breaking and needing to be replaced; I have replaced 5 regulators (all rear window) between April 2007 and Aug 2009.,
"Two weeks ago, body control module and two window modules went out at once, $1,800 to fix all three. Had no warranty, and insurance won't cover. We will never buy a Dodge/Jeep again.",
I have a 2003 Jeep Liberty. I am about to replace the window regulator for the 4th time on the rear back window. I have also replaced the right rear back window twice. The Chrysler dealer has admitted this is a defect in the car. What recourse is there? Each replacement is about $350.00.,
"I purchased my 2007 Jeep Liberty on June 8, 2009. I have had it for 7 weeks and I just had to replace the driver side window regulator at a cost of $340.00. You not only have to replace the regulator, but also the window. If I would have known about this problem beforehand, I would not have purchased a Jeep. I thought I did all my homework before buying it. I guess I didn't. To some this might not seem like a lot of money, but it put a big dent in my budget. I am now afraid if and when the others go, I will not be able to afford to have it fixed. Why has this not been recalled?",
"I have a Jeep Liberty 2005, and it only has 71,000 miles. And now, I need a new transmission.",
"We have had a lot of problems with this Jeep. You can stop for a red light and when you try to go, it will start to cough and sputter. If you turn it off and restart, it will be okay. It has done this since about 19,000 miles. It is a standard 6-speed transmission. I have 41,000 miles and it is starting to act like it doesn't want to go in gear. My son bought the same model 2 weeks after me and he had the same problem until it wouldn't go into 4th gear. Just had to have the transmission rebuilt.",
"I am currently in the process of replacing my second window regulator within one month. The driver side window regulator was replaced first, and now, I need to replace the front passenger window regulator. The cost for each of these repairs is around $300 each. I am wondering why no recall has been issued by Daimler Chrysler because, as I have found out, this is a very common problem. This is an extreme cost that should be fixed for free by Daimler Chrysler and not the automobile owner. I would greatly appreciate any information and updates relating to the window regulator issue that you can provide me with.
      To date, I will have incurred approximately $600 in costs, not to mention the shock/surprise when my windows just ""fell down"" when the regulators went bad. This is especially inconvenient during summer time when the outside temperature is very high and the air conditioner is cooling the outside and not the inside of the car because of the open window.",
"All four regulators have went bad on my jeep, along with two electric fan relays. How many more complaints are needed to get a recall on this matter? I have always been a Jeep lover, but is it really worth it? $350.00 per each window is **!",
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty window regulator broke again. I have had all the windows fail and some have been repaired two times. Now, I have to pay $100 deductible per window. They will not waive the fee. They said it is written in my extended warranty contract. However, I already had it repaired and the repair failed. I have been trying to get this fixed for over two weeks. Now, I have been told they are fixing it a new way, so that tells me the original part failed. The first replacement failed and now they are replacing the glass. Can you say defect? My dealer closed and the place I was sent to for service dose not do anything for me. You can tell they do not want me there because I did not buy my car there. I called Chrysler everyday on my way to work. My open case is now about 14 pages long. Chrysler told me that they do not have any parts contracts at this time and do not know when they will have it. Therefore, I am paying $400 a month to drive a car with a taped window. I cannot lock the car because you can slide the window down. I do not feel safe in the car at night in parking lots or stopping at red lights. Chrysler said my safety is not a recall reason or a concern for them. See if I make my payment this month.",
"On February 2, 2009 while traveling out of town, my 2007 Jeep quit shifting. It would not shift out of first gear. The problem is the front module had to be reprogrammed. A computer chip lost communication with the electric gear shift module according to the dealer. I found out from the repair dealer that the reprogramming could have been done prior to the car break down and that the manufacturer was aware of the problem on Jeeps. I questioned why this was not a factory recall issue. The dealer stated since it was not considered a safety issue, it was not a recall. Not a safety issue? What is safe about one's car suddenly not shifting from first gear? This could result in a collision. 
      I had to pay for towing to a repair dealership, a hotel, and a rental car to use while it was fixed. I feel the manufacturer should notify consumers about a problem like this so it can be addressed prior to drivers being stranded on the side of the road. The total cost of towing and car rental came to $154.22. It would be good customer service if Jeep would reimburse me. The situation was preventable with a simple notice in the mail that the module needed reprogramming. I would appreciate hearing from Jeep on this issue. Thanks.",
"I have had my Jeep 2004 Liberty's window regulator replaced now for the 5th time. This time when it broke, it even took out the lock mechanism. The car is out of warranty, but for the past 3 years every summer, I have had to replace at least 1 regulator. Last year, it was 3 of them that went bad. I have called Chrysler/Jeep multiple times and they always tell me that they are not aware of any problems. They are able to lie through their teeth every time about it. If there are no problems, then why is there a freaking backlog on inventory for this part for the whole nation? According to the dealer, it is going to take them a while to even get the part. Currently, they had to manually lift the window up and duct tape the entire window so that it will not go down. The downside to that, beyond how cheap of a temporary fix it is, is that the door will no longer open either now. So I have now a door that will not open and ugly looking duct tape all around it. 
      On top of all of this, they are forcing me to pay for the repair that they know is going to break again. How is that even fair? I own 2 vehicles from Chrysler currently. My PT Cruiser from 2001 still has had no problems. Why can't they just use the same regulator used in those vehicles on the jeep or at least something made the same way. I can guarantee that I will never by any vehicle made by them again. My Chrysler was made in Mexico, while my Jeep was made in Detroit. No wonder they went bankrupt when they can't even fix a single item that so many people are having issues with.",
"I had to replace driver's window regulator for about $500. Yesterday, while driving, I heard a thump and the passenger window slipped down into the window well.",
"I purchased a 2003 Jeep Liberty with 4000 miles on it in 2004 from a Jeep dealership, Global Auto Mall. All the problems started at around 60,000 miles. First, the exhaust manifold cracked; then at 80,000 miles, the whole top end of the engine needed to be rebuilt. Now, the passenger side ball joint failed (mind you, after a recall they had a while ago), which I had replaced at the dealer. I am very lucky that I was not going that fast when it happened. I could have been in a serious accident.",
"My clutch pedal stopped working on my 2007 Jeep Compass while I was driving on Friday, June 26, and I had it towed to the nearby Central Avenue Chrysler Jeep Dodge (It is manual transmission and cannot be operated without a clutch). They found a cylinder to be defective, empty of fluid, and ordered replacement parts. As of July 6, I am still without my car -10 days - and they refuse to provide me with substitute transportation, saying that Chrysler requires the additional extended warranty to be purchased for such coverage (My car is under 30,000 miles and still under the original warranty). This has cost me hundreds of dollars in transportation costs and lost work hours!",
"My husband is a mechanic. He and his employer, Alan **, were trying to maneuver a Jeep Liberty into the work stall from the parking lot. The Jeep had a broken ball joint and would not steer, so my husband was guiding it with a floor jack while Alan was gently giving the vehicle gas to slowly move it forward and into place, so it could be worked on. The Jeep suddenly shot forward under full acceleration on its own, while Alan literally stood as hard as he could on the brake. The vehicle left a long black skid line behind it where the back tires were trying to brake, but the front tires were continuing to accelerate. My husband was hit and dragged fifteen feet then crushed against an upright support.
      My husband is currently hospitalized. He has a broken nose, broken collarbone, four broken ribs and a broken ankle. We don't know how long he will be hospitalized, and we're looking at a long recovery time during which he will be unable to work. It is a workman's compensation claim, which will cost his employer and which will cost us time and effort to pursue. Meanwhile, I don't know how we will meet our financial obligations and Alan **, who was behind the wheel, is under examination regarding the incident.",
"From 5/20/08 until 12/04/08, I have seen them four times involving my driver's side door. They replaced the door latch two times and charged me overall close to $400. I have had a compression fracture in my back and Willie Racine's is over two hours away for me to get to. Having to climb over the passenger seat every time I get in and out of my jeep has been a real problem. Recently, in February, I had my spine fused. Approximately three weeks ago (June 16), my door started to seize up again. I cannot drive to Burlington at this time, let alone, very much and having to now climb over the passenger seat once again has become ridiculous. 
      I called Jeep and they said ""I just don't know what is going on with that door"", ""bring it in and we will take another look at it"" to which I replied, ""I can't, I am too far away!"" I was charged $30 by McNeil's Auto Center to get the door to open, $65.00 for the part that we need for the door and that isn't including labor! I have spent over $400.00 on my door at the Jeep dealership where I purchased my jeep and I am about to spend another $150.00 for someone else to put the new part in and the cost of the part. This is totally ludicrous!",
"I have had two automatic windows go out at an expense of $300 each so I called Jeep! Their service dept simply stated that I did not have an insurance. Now, a third window is out. Why have they not sent a recall for the constant problem? It costs $300 to replace a piece of plastic inside the door that should never have failed in the place!",
"I have a grey  Chrysler 300 basic model 2.7liter v6 engine. All my lights on the dash board came on. I took it to the dealer. They said they did not see anything. Okay, I took the car back home next day. For the second time, the car shut off in the middle of the street with my kids in the car. I was very afraid. I had to call my husband. He came half an hour later. The car started back up but all the lights was still on. I called the dealer and they told me to bring it the next day. The lady at the dealer that put the number tags in the car got in the car with me and saw the dash light up. So they kept the car again. They called me back again and told me to come get the car. Again, they still don't see anything. They drove the car for 8 miles, nothing.
      I picked the car up that afternoon, drove of the lot lights and the RPM went crazy. Now I'm turning right back around. They told me again to come back in the morning to go out in the field with the technician. Now, the tech has the machine on the car driving around did not go not even two blocks, the lights and RPM went crazy but it's not showing up on the computer. They kept it again. Two days later, they called me back and said it was my aftermarket alarm that was the problem. I drove home no problem. Second day, Monday morning, lights and RPM, also the engine don't sound right and now the engine light is on. On Monday morning, 6/22/09, I took the car right back to the dealer. The technician said he do not know what's wrong and he did everything to the car. Now I don't know when I'm going to get my car back. I have kids to take care of and have no transportation. I'm financially very low to keep maintaining rentals. They had my car about five times. They blame my aftermarket alarm. Now, the car has no alarm park in the streets. The seller is not happy. They're trying to get me in another car and to get me to put more money down on a new car. That's not right. They have no answer on my car and I need help.",
"I bought and serviced my Jeep religiously at the dealership. I was having drivability issues and brake problems. It was supposedly serviced and the problems returned. My last visit, I was furious. My Jeep was blowing through stop signs, the brakes weren't reliable. I received a quote for rotors after leaving the vehicle for 24 hours for diagnosis. It had 18000km. I felt something wasn't right and seek service elsewhere. The two inside brake pads were incorrectly installed, right side on left wheel, left side on right wheel. The rotors were replaced at my cost. The front wheel bearing hubs, front axle seals and rear pinion seal failed shortly after, they were replaced under warranty. That was at 20,000km.
      Now, the sway bar connects have been replaced. The clutch, pressure plate, release bearing, pilot bearing have been replaced at my cost. The transmission is not functioning well and the rear axle seals show signs of leaking (I had the seals inspected twice, they were never replaced). I guess 20,000km of intermittently pushing the inside brake pads have diminished all the other drive line components, some to the point of failure. The customer support individual I contacted stated there was no power train issues. As a result, I asked for an email, document reflecting that none could be provided. No money in good work.",
"Every single one of my windows has needed new regulators. I have searched Online and it seems to be a common problem with Jeeps. Each time I take it to the dealership to be replaced, it ends up costing me close to $500.00!",
"Like many other complaints, I am reading and my windows are giving out. I replaced my front driver's side window in August 2008 ($393 bill) and just today, I took in my Jeep again. This time, it's my passenger's side window. The bill this time is $526. There needs to be a recall! Financially, it is crippling me to keep getting my windows repaired.",
"I own a Jeep Liberty 2007. I have started to have issues with this car's windows since a year after I owned it. I took it to the dealership once and was fixed after 2 days although I let them know this was my only vehicle and that I needed it ASAP. Customer service was poor, I have been having issues with my brakes as well. It seems like it takes a while to respond. I took it to have an oil change and had them check my brakes and they stated they were okay. My driver's window fell off and when I called to see if they would repair it, they told me my warranty had expired at 36K miles, it's 38K. I was furious. The thing is if they know that this particular cars are having issues with the windows, the least that they can do is extend this warranty and do some checkups every so often. I'm so unsatisfied. As soon as I can, I'm getting rid of this car.",
"Maybe I should be writing what hasn't gone wrong with my jeep. The passenger side window switch will roll the window down but not up, the transmission has locked up at 50K miles, the wheel bearings went out at 38k miles and now, it sometimes stalls when sitting in traffic. I really feel like letting Jeep have it back. If Chrysler made better quality cars then maybe they wouldn't be bankrupt!",
"I leased a 2006 Jeep Liberty, originating from a dealership in Louisiana, currently registered in California. I had the vehicle serviced at a Los Angeles dealership in July, 2008 and had an air compressor replaced under warranty. The vehicle lease included a 3-yr, 26,000 basic warranty. The Jeep now has $53,000 and during a routine oil change and tire replacement, the technician stated there seemed to be something wrong with the transmission fluid, it was ""unusually black"" for a car with low mileage. I called to make an appointment at Midway Jeep in San Diego and spoke with Pat Twist, service advisor. They have informed me since that there is metal in the transmission fluid and it will cost me $750 for them to do the tear-down just to see what the problem is. I called the Jeep main line and they said they would pay for the tear-down, then negotiate the fee for repair, assuming the transmission has a defect. Now the dealership has informed me I am responsible for the cost of tear-down, then paying an ""unknown fee"" for repair.  The lease on the Jeep end on January 1st 2010, therefore in 6 months the vehicle will be returned to Chrysler. The vehicle rightfully belongs to Chrysler, they are the lien holder, I do not feel I should pay for their faulty transmission then return the vehicle in six (6) months.",
I own a 2006 jeep liberty that 2 of the windows fell off.my mechanic told me all window regulators have to be replaced with upgrades made by jeep which also means the windows have to be replaced.these should be a safety recall item.,
"I purchase a 07 Jeep Commander. Since then I have brought my veh to the dealership 4 times. The entire vehicle vibrates while stopped at red lights. It shuts off, shuts  back on then violently jerks forward. computer have been reset and the vehicle does it now more than ever! My most recent life threatening expereince was whiledriving at approx. 30 mph the accelator hit the floor and even applying the brake the veh rose the 65mph and brake was not working. When veh finally came to a stop on its ownand withfoot on brake, the car reved loudlyas though I had my foot on accelator. I had to turn it off. Brought veh to dealership and was told nothing is wrong! Also if I press for the windows togo down they goup and vis versa! I am aware of all the complaints and the NHTSA has an ongoing investigation into jeep vehicles but I feel like someone will have to die before we see justice done! I have filed many complaints and will be contacting my Union Lawyer in the morning.We as Jeep Owner did nothing wrong except purchase Lemons that Chyrsler knows have major life threatening defects!",
I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty - the rear left window no longer goes up or down - in talking with other Liberty owners I hear the same story over and over again.  It will cost me $370 to have it fixed!!,
"The 3.7L engines in the Jeep Liberty are failing at or around 75K miles. To replace this engine, new is approximately $3-4K. Why? Jeep no longer makes this engine due to the problems with the engines seizing. Just looking on the internet shows thousands of people with the same problem.",
"It happened shortly after purchasing my new 2007 Jeep Commander. It would give a hesitation while sitting at a stop light or while in park like it was about to die. It would also rev up the engine like it was accelerating. We took it in a few months after we bought it. They said they found nothing wrong and did nothing at that time. It continued to do it, but we just put up with it because we figured we'd hear the same thing (it doesn't happen every time we drive it, just periodically). So now, it's doing it more intensely. It's as if someone is mashing on the gas pedal while in park and also at stop lights while I have my foot on brakes. Once, it has jumped forward and I thought I would hit the car ahead of me. 
      I took it in again. They reset the computer and, since, it has done it again a couple days after getting it out. I will call them back, but looking at the complaints online shows me something is terribly wrong with Jeeps unintentionally accelerating. Please help. I don't want to cause an accident or hurt myself or anyone else. I saved receipts from the dealership over this problem. Please examine all our complaints. Not everyone knows how to submit complaints to this agency. Just look online or perhaps check every single dealership.",
"While driving on the road, the car just pops out of gear like it is in neutral. I have to pull over and put it in park, then I can drive again but it has done it several times. This is very dangerous as it could cause an accident.",
My 2006 Jeep Liberty with 31000 miles began swaying back and forth while driving on the highway. Vehicle was taken to the dealership. The service department has been working on the vehicle for 2-1/2 weeks. New parts were installed but vehicle still has the same problem. It will now be 3-weeks. Vehicle is still at dealership. I was never offered a rental as part of the warranty agreement. Chrysler and Jeep consumer complaint was contacted. This vehicle has had problems since new. Chrysler says I must work with the dealer. I have also written Department of Highway safety. Still no action. The vehicle has been a lemon since new. I have also written to consumer affairs and nothing has changed.,
"I bought a 2003 Jeep Liberty new and have less tha 40,000 miles on it when the rear window (which is never used) just fell down.

"My car was in an accident.  State Farm the insurer.  Car sounded lke a disel. had a large ticking.  Contacted insurance company took auto to  Chrysler Jeep collision center (CJCC) for check and repair as insurance company would not repair.  CJCC said some bolts were broken and they had to take them all out and replace. Bolts broke again , Jack Caruso's Regency  said two on opposite broke , bolts never removed,  I have to pay. I was told they would replace ALL BOLTS. The service manager said the broken bolts put a train on the other so to had to replace all bolts. This issue is a joint issue with STATE FARM who does not seem to want to pay any claims in FLORIDA. It is like pulling teeth.",
"This is not a complaint about the Methuen Chrysler dealer, it is about the 2006 Jeep Commander I own.  I took it there because I read of a stalling recall with these vehicles.  Apparently, my vehicle isn't recalled, yet it has been having the same stalling issues, which is dangerous.  The dealer also couldn't locate the problem.  I would like to see this particular model added to the recall list of the current Jeep Commanders that stall.",
"I and my husband purchased a 2005 jeep liberty and now i wish that we had never made the purchase. This vehicle seems as though it is a death trap. Whenever the roads are wet, this vehicle slid on day and it would not stop spinning and i and a friend ended up facing the wrong direction once the jeep stopped, this is one instance. And another instance this samething happened where the jeep just automatically starts skidding with barely any acceleration at all. Thank god both instances my children were not with me in the car. I feel like im trapped into this because we have already gotten financed for this vehicle and have made the 1st payment so we are stuck with something that appears to be very dangerous...",
"In the past year my 2004 Jeep Liberty has had 3 out of the 4 windows malfunction due to a faulty regulator.  The window just falls down into the door panel with no pre warning signs at all.  The first one broke by just touching the window from the outside, this makes for a very easy break in.  The other 2 windows malfunctioned within weeks of each other.  I now can not use any of my windows and fear window #4 will be breaking soon.  My windows are being held up by a wooden beam that has been placed on the inside panel of the door.  I do plan to have the drivers side repaired, however the part is on back order and it can take up to 3 months to come in.  The reason it is on back order is because it is in such high demand - this is a huge problem w/ the Jeep Liberty. Just take a look on the on-line message boards - there are several very upset Jeep owners out there.",

"I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty. I have never been so disappointed and annoyed with a vehicle. My Check Engine light kept coming up randomly. I took it to Autozone and they said I had a small evaporative leak. I took it to 2 mechanics (as I was also trying to register it) and they couldn't figure out the problem. I also took it to TWO different dealers who each said they didn't know but would change out the hose for me. I let them do it, the light went off ($300 later) and I got it registered. Three months later, the light is back on.

There have been no issues with my husbands Jeep; however, mine has suffered a myriad of malfunctions since the date of delivery. These have included the front driver and passenger power windows, alarmingly loud rattling from both front doors and dashboard, a section of the rear bumper detaching and hanging off, the rearview mirror needing to be fixed ; and most recently, starting the car this morning, and discovering that neither the heat nor the radio were working.
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                         
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        Following the first three returns to the dealership for the above problems, I suggested that the lemon law might apply. I was told by the service manager, that it would not, as the law refers to a single problem that, following three attempts at repair, cannot be resolved. I cannot imagine that the law will not cover the purchase of a vehicle that continues, over the course of a year, to break down, piece by piece.

"MY sliding roof is making excessive wind niose when driving 50 and above on the expressway.  It is so loud you can not hear the radio or another person talking without yelling.  I did take it to the dealership, but the service manager said that its the characteristic of the slidiing roof.

I drove my new jeep through some water less deep than the recommended height by jeep and at walking pace along with a number of other vehicles ( on my local road home ) the jeep died half way through and the garage say it is my fault as water splashed up the front of the car. In fact the jeep trail rating procedure shows jeeps fording water up over the bonnet so how can the garage say its my fault?,
I find it ridiculous that jeep has not had a recall on its exhuast manifolds for the 98 Jeep TJ model.  I have just recently installed another new exhaust manifold and this is literally number 4 for manifolds.  Obviously there is a defect but Jeep/Chrysler will not recognize it as defect and manifolds are anything but cheap!,
When we purchased our vehicle it was not disclosed to us that the key system had changed. My husband wanted a spare key for his car and  when we went to the hardware store we were told that they could not do this any longer and it would cost me $140 and up for a new ket from the dealer. I honestly feel this new safety chip issue is just another way for car corporations to make a buck off consumers. I used to be able to make a spare key for a couple of bucks  a few years back and now it costs a couple of hundred?!?! Where is the justice?,
"I was driving to work one a few days ago when I noticed that my rear driver side window was down.  I tried to get it to go back up.  Fortunately, I am able to push the window back into place as the vehicle is parked, but once I begin driving, the window slides back down a couple of inches.",
"Recently, my low coolant warning light was appearing. I did not see any apparent leaks and just refilled it to full level. That was then followed by the oil pressure gauge dropping down to near zero when at idle or just slowing down. It would rise up again during acceleration but not to normal status. After bringing it to a local reliable repair shop he discovered coolant mixed in with the oil and that it would ultimately cause damage to the main bearing, if not already damaged, resulting in a major overhaul or a new or rebuilt engine ($3,500.00).

                            
                                
      When searching for solutions on the internet I discovered countless other Jeep owners who have or are experiencing the same or similiar problem.  There wss some indication that Chrysler/Jeep has been aware of this problem but have not willing to take the initiative to either recall or may for all the repairs caused by cracked cylinder heads, which seem to be the most common cause followed by faulty headgaskets.",
"I have a 2005 jeep liberty. Since I have owned it i have had the same problem with it many times.  When I first got it it was in the shop a few months later.  On 08-15-2006 it was in the shop for a few days because of evap leaks in the emissions system. Also the canister and the solenoid were replpaced.  on 8-25-06 it was in the shop again for nvld canister, vent valve solenoid circuit high and once again  a vaccum leak.  on 08-31-2006 it was in the shop for valve on natural vaccum leak and a leak in the emissions system. for the last few years my malfunction light comes on for weeks and then goes off. now it is on and it continues to stay on.  I no longer know what to do.  I do not want to take  my car to the shop all the time.  It costs to much and the economy is getting terrible.  I have had nothing but issues with my jeep.  The only thing is i love my jeep.",
2006 Jeep Liberty window has fallen down and won't go up.,
"I purchased a 2002 jeep liberty (used) in early spring 2004. It ran well until the end of November. Then whenever I drove it until the engine reached temperature it would die at an idle state. It would restart but it would die again if I was not able to give it gas. I have had it at several mechanics. They have no idea why it does this. They have tried everything. Chrysler dealership had it for almost 2 weeks and said they could not find anything wrong. Driving it home from there it died. I do not think quality motors is to blame but I think they knew they had a lemon vehicle. 
      I have called Chrysler corp. and they said to take it to another dealership and call them from there. In order to do this I must have it towed about 30 miles and pay for it. This has cost me a lot of money by not being able to go anywhere I want and to go, where and when I need. I am always afraid it will die and not start again. What I do not understand is that no one seems to know what to do. This vehicle could cause an accident very easily by stalling. That is why I do not push the idea of traveling very far.",
We purchased a used vehicle (2005 Jeep) for my daughter. I have experienced the sudden acceleration that launches the vehicle forward when your foot is on the brake. The only way to stop it is to turn the car off. Today I almost ran into a medical center. I have had it in once and CarMax said they could not find a problem. Today I had it towed and they can keep it!!!!! That car is going to kill someone!!!!!,
"My mother owns a 2004 Jeep Liberty Sport 4x4 which I drive daily. We purchased it used at 38,000 in excellent condition from a local dealer. We had purchased an extended warranty from her credit union. At 67,000 miles approx. without warning, meaning no lights came on to indicate any problems, the Jeep began sounding like the engine was knocking, like a 1970's hotrod missing most of its oil. I immediately pulled over, called my garage and had the Jeep towed. Long story short. Jeep would not cover the problem. 
      The problem, ALL THE LIFTERS WERE BAD!! I had every record of service on this Jeep. I changed the oil every 3,000. I did everything they required per their recommendations. This should have still been under the 70,000 mile drive train warranty. They of course said it was not, refusing to pay or speak to me any further. Thank God I had talked my mom into getting extended warranty. We had to fight them, but I had proof that I had taken excellent care of the Jeep and maintained excellent service on the Jeep and it was of no fault of ours, but a defect with the vehicle. The cost was in excess of $2300.00. Now I am having issues with the heating system!!! The Jeep is sucking down coolant almost daily; it does not leak, just drinks it! Again, not over heat light, the temp. gauge reads normal, all of the hoses are in good condition, and the thermostat does not need replaced. I am out of ideas. If my mom was not in debt for this piece of ** I would have her trade. I would hate for someone else to get our problems. We still have problems with the front suspension even after they did the recall, when it is cold the front end squeaks, moans, and groans every time you go over a parking bump, you think it was a 100 yrs old. This started right after they did the recall replacement. Thank you for allowing me to vent. I realize in no way this helps my situation, but sometimes, it is nice just to speak your mind.",

"I have a 2006 Jeep Commander which has has extensive stalling issues.  Once on a highway , other times thank Gld in a parking lot or when I was making a sharp left turn.  My third row seat belt no longer will function.  Jeep says to bring it in for a charge.  Left front window leaks in heavy rain.  Now passenger front door opens when it feels like it, appears frozen in 5o degree temperatures.  Its the worse automobile I have ever owned.  Poor workmanship.  Plastic covers on seat belts have fallen off.  Don't buy a Jeep.",
"I have a 2006 Jeep Commander and at 38, 000 miles my water pump needed to be replaced. I also do not recommend the fabric seats due to the fact that they stain easily. I had my water bottle on the passanger seat and the condensation from the bottle made a huge wet spot. I was able to clean the seats but this is a continued problem.",
My second window regulator has failed in a car under 5 years old. It is obibously a design flaw that Crysler is unwilling to admit to. I was charges $100.00 more for the part this time than last. We are all feeling inflation but that is robery.,
"I own a 2007 Jeep Commander Limited with 5.7l hemi purchased new in September 2007. In October 2008 I began to experience sporadic engine stalling and bucking problems. The stalling occurred while at a stop, travelling at highway speeds with loss of all power, or while driving down the street. This situation could cause accident, injury, or death. Initially thought it might be contaminated gas, but problem persisted. Took it to the Jeep Dealer on November 24, 2008. Their diagnostic test did not pick up anything but based on their online research saw others experiencing similar problems. The dealer implemented Chrysler Star solution # KO5558363. Picked up the Jeep and it stalled within a few blocks of the dealer. Returned the Jeep to the dealer on December 2 (after Thanksgiving Holiday) and called Chrysler Service and received a Reference Number. Since December 2, the dealer has attempted each of the following which have all failed to fix the problem, 1)Replace ignition switch, 2) Added insulation to cables leading to engine control unit to shield against an electromagnetic field thought to be disrputing signals to/from ECU, 3) Replaced ECU, 4)Replaced airflow sensor based on diagnostic messages indicating this may be a problem, 5) at request of Chrysler, dealer went back over all cabling, connections and diagnostics. All of the preceding attempts failed to fix the problem. The vehicle is still at the dealer. Their next attempt will be to look at a potential wiring harness defect.",
"The window regulator in my 2006 Jeep Liberty has been repaired three times on the passenger window on the driver's side.  In addition, I have had the driver's side window repaired for the same reason.  I am being told the plastic regulator snaps causing the window to drop and the motor will no longer function to put it up.  As the passenger window is never and I stress never used I feel this is a flaw in the design.  I was told the regulator in the past was made of metal and now has been replaced with plastic.  If it gets cold (note I live on the Western Slope of the Rocky Mountains, cold is inevitable)this part will snap.  It is troublesome enough to have to be inconvenienced with having to take my wehicle to the shop, I am now inccurring charges for this replacement as the vehicle has 51,000 + miles and I am only helped by having the extended warranty with a deductible.  I feel I am being unfairly charged for a inadequency of the performance of this tough wehicle.",

All this was noted under warranty and has gone on long since.  I got it out of the shop yesterday for the 15th time and before i left the lot the radio static occured ( that they have looked at and replaced 2 head untis already)  they were shocked and said it was the amp.  Replaced the amp yesterday and 15 minute after leaving the shop the left speakers stopped working.  The car stalled out again today.  I called the dealership and they have said they dont know what to do and to call Chrysler service again to open another case.  Chrysler is a little stumped and said they have spoken to my dealer and he confirmed he doesnt know what to do to resolve this issue.  Chrysler will get back to me tomorrow.",

"It all started when we got the Jeep. Its a 97 and we got it in 05. Not even a month after we got it the transmission goes out. It worked fine when we bought it. So we get it replaced. A few months later the rear differential goes. So we replace that, another couple hundered. Between then and a few months ago I havent had much problem. Every once and a while IT wont start. I have had to replace the TPS, MAP and O2 censors. There is an error with the transfer case clutch selnoid circuit. So broad a problem, No money to figure out.",
"I bought a new 2006 Jeep Liberty on November 28, 2006. Since then the window regulators have broken SEVEN times. Each of the four windows have been affected, replaced, and are breaking again with the replacement parts. This is an extremely common problem with Jeeps and it is absolutely inexcusable that the company has not issued a recall. I will get rid of the car before the warranty period is up because I refuse to pay $350 every time a $20 part breaks - and then I will buy a Toyota.",
I have taken my 2007 Jeep Commander 3 times to a 5 star Daimler Chrysler dealer for engine repairs. My jeep is also turning off while I am driving. The response I received from the service manager (Dave **) was that there are no reported incidents like this on this vehicle. I was never told that they are aware of the problem and there is a dedicated team working on it. I also reported to him that I was nearly in a car accident due to this. I was driving on the parkway @ 65 mph when my engine completely stopped. All he did was shake his head and state that hopefully they could fix the problem. Well the problem is not fixed and I nearly was in another accident. Do you have any updates on the investigation? Can this car be considered a lemon by law? Please contact me @ above #.,
"This is the third or fourth time my vehicle has been brought in for the same problem. Each time it's for the ABS/BAS and ESP lamp coming on. The dealer said the codes are stored, but must be Active to locate the problem. My concern is the lamps come on while driving on the highway at 50-60 mph. I've written to Department of Highway Safety twice and filed a complaint. Tonight, I wrote to Chrysler and Car Survey.",
"I have a 2005 Jeep Liberty. I was driving with the windows up and heard a pop sound and the left rear window was down and the regulator is broken. I really can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars to fix this problem, so I have my windows help up with cardboard. I am afraid to park anywhere because the window is not secure. I've seen that many people have had this problem and I think Jeep should be responsible for paying for the repairs. My warranty was just up in May of this year and since then, I also had the A/C break and now I need a new transmission cooler which the dealer said is not covered under the powertrain warranty. I purchased this car because of its reputation as being dependable and sturdy, and it is falling apart after 3 years.",
"I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty that I have had for only a year and a half. I am on top of this car with everything that sounds fun or even looks funny. One day leaving the gas station I go to lower my driver side window when suddenly I hear a big pop and my window isn't moving at all. I took it to the Jeep dealer and they told me it was a window regulator.
      OK no problem. I figure I'll pay about 200 bucks and have it fixed. Well I was in for a big surprise. The part itself cost $329 bucks, $48.15 just to look at it, and another $175 bucks for labor. $552.00 to fix the window are you kidding me??? Why hasn't there been a recall on this. I have seen many complaints ONLINE and a couple of people that I know have all had the same problem around the same time I have. RECALL PLEASE!!!!!!!!!",
"I bought my 2006 Jeep Liberty used in January. While at the dealership my son and I were told that the Jeep had a warranty and to call Jeep and have it transferred. We were told that by the salesman and the guy who did the loan papers. I called Jeep and was told the only warranty that the Jeep had was a body warranty for the paint and what not. So, of course, I did not get that transferred. The low-lifes at the dealership lied to me. Well, as time went on the instrument panel lights, one at a time, flash on and off. My rear passenger window will no longer function and I shoved door stops in it to hold it up. And last but not least, so far, sometimes she will not start. I feel like I was lied to and taken advantage of. 
      I feel like this is fraud. I purchased a vehicle under false pretenses. Anyway, as you all know - Jeep and the dealership don't care. So now, I have 5 years to pay on a piece of crap while trying to work full time, part time, go back to school and raise a teenager on my own. I hate Jeep and they should pay for their deception and lack of care. All I pray for now is to get out of this payment and away from this vehicle. Heck, I can get a loan for 3 grand and buy a clunker down the road and have less drama. Oh, and the ding I hear constantly going off while driving is going to make me snap (forgot to mention that earlier). Thank you for listening or should I say reading. I feel a bit better. Good luck to you all.",
"I bought the Commander as a demo as told to us by the salesperson, but it actually turned out to be a rental that was turned in that I found out later on Carfax. Since day one, the car has been a nightmare--warped rotors, does not start every 2000-5000 miles, electrical just stops working, including radio, interior and exterior lights, battery, and it occasionally stalls. The car has been in the shop at least ten times but the problem keeps returning. I went on the NHTSA web site and saw that this car has over 300 complaints, including many where the car stalls at high rates of speed. I am terrified to drive it. 
      The dealer will only give me 13500 on my trade, but I owe 18,835. I saved to buy this car and there is no way I can take a hit this size. So I have a $456/mo payment, plus $110 for insurance, and I wont drive the car because it is not safe. Also, I am told that because there is a recall on the car, I just have to keep bringing it back to get fixed--I don't have a lemon law claim because Jeep acknowledged the problem.",
"Sentry Key Immobolizing System. The idea what to prevent theft. My truck thought that I was trying to steal my own truck. I have all of the original keys, and apparently sometimes those original chip keys go out. Therefore my Jeep could no longer read the original key and it has locked itself using the S.K.I.S. I have to pay $100 for a tow company, then fork over $90 to the dealership to have it analyzed. 
      Then they have to re-set the truck, $125-$325. After that it is going to cost me $50 to have new keys made. And I thought that only people with lost keys have new keys made. I was told by Jeep that sometimes these things happen, and if I wanted my truck to start again then I had to take it to the dealership, and have it reset by them. what a rip off! I am a poor college student who cannot afford to pay all of these extra non-mechanical mishaps. I am a girl, who found out how to fix my Jeeps alternator by buying a book and fixing it myself. I saw that there was some kind of lawsuit going on about this because studies have shown that this S.K.I.S does nothing to prevent theft! I have no money and have to walk to the bus stop to get to work and school. I still owe money on my jeep and my warranty which does not cover this item is out. Please help me!",
"Have a 2006 Jeep Liberty CRD, and at 36160.0 miles the left rear window just fell down. The window regulator had broken. I have never used the rear windows, as I only use A/C due to the hot humid weather here. This really concerns me, as I see hundreds of threads about the same thing with other jeep owners. 
      I am a photographer that carries cameras in the vehicle and now I am afraid to use the jeep because a window may just fall open when I am in a store exposine the camera gear. This is exactly what happened, but thank God no one stole the cameras... this time!Scared to use the vehicle for photo shoots which is why I bought the vehicle! Scared the other windows will just fall open!",
"We bought a 2006 Jepp liberty because we were able to greenslip it. It has been the worse purchase that we have ever investied in. There was a problem with the interior seats staining from rain water. We tried and tried to get this fixed. They only response was we know there is a problem with stainig but there is nothing we can do. This was from the dealer and Jeep itself. 
      Then about 6 months ago the motor(regulator) in the window broke. It was $350 to fix. Now the other rear window has the same problem. We were told that they know that there is problem with the window tracts thta causes extra pressure on the window and the motor and its parts. It was in a bullentin but no recall. This is beyond frustrsating! Do we even dare put the windows down? How soon before we replace another window? We only have 46,000 miles. The Jeep is supposed ot be for my wife but with all the problems I am scared to keep it as her primary vehichle.We have had 2 window motors/regulators replaced at $350 a piece $200 a year to have the interior Zi-barted(they get the stains out as often as needed which is once a month)  Plus money for vehichles while ours was in the shop.",
"My boyfriend and I purchased the 2002 Jeep Liberty Limited and Sport, respectively. This spring he had the engine replaced at less than 120k miles.  Since my purchase I have had the air conditioner, catalytic converter and ball joints (recall) replaced.  In the last 1 3/4 years I have had the transmission replaced and my recently the cylinder valve springs on one cylinder.  I believe our problems are from the fact we bought the Libertys the first year they were out and Jeep did not work all the kinks out of it so we are paying dearly. 
      I am waiting to see if Chrysler reburses for the cost of the springs and I have yet to file a claim for the transmission and my boyfriend my submit one for the engine as well.  In the meantime we have received no information from Chrysler about the possible problems.  I doubt that out of thousands of models produced for 2002, that he and I have the only 2 lemons. Transmission over $2000 Engine $4000 Springs over $450",
"I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty Limited Edition.  I purchased it used in February 08 and within 2 weeks, the rear window regulator went out.  fortunately, the dealer where I purchased from fixed it.  Now, 6 months later, another rear window fell down and I had the service station look at it and was told it was the regulator in the window.  
      Since there are 61000 miles on it, this is not covered costing me $350 to get it fixed.  the other windows sound like something is going to happen to them also.  I do not have $ to keep fixing windows.  Why hasn't something been done to fix this problem?",
"First of all, I love my Jeep Liberty (2002)! It goes downhill from here - What is with these window regulators? I just had the rear passenger replaced on 5-30-08. One replaced on the left rear on 6-27-06 and another one on the right rear on 2-28-06. I had to go to the grocery store this morning and when I put my daughter in the back seat something sounded like it fell. Guess what it was? MY LEFT REAR WINDOW! I am a stay at home mother with another one on the way, do I sound like I can just go out and get two windows fixed every 2 years? I am getting very frustrated with this issue. My mother-in-law has had to replace two of these in her front passenger window too. Thanks.

"i have a question regarding the complaint from -----Mart of Oakdale PA (05/09/07) Jeep Commander: Stalling - The only reason my engine stalled on a few occasion was because my knee hit the key and turned off the engine.-----can you actually turn these vehicles off while they are still in gear????? my understanding is (and i think i've had this happen to me) - if you attempt to turn the key off without putting the vehicle in park - it won't turn off. am i incorrect????? 
      just a question.....",
"I purchased my 2002 Jeep Liberty brand new in late 2001. I've had nothing but problems and excuses from Chrysler. In 2007 I parked at work (I'm in law enforcement), and much to my dismay, the window was all the way down. The rear window regulator had gone out. Gone was my laptop, portfolio, and backpack. It was raining, so the seats and paperwork were drenched. The local Jeep dealer made the repairs for upward of $250.00. Three months later, the other rear window went out in much the same way. I paid to have it repaired, as Chrysler explained it wasn't covered under warranty and wasn't a recall matter. Now in 2008, on September 12, 2008, I'm driving when I notice both rear windows are down, apparently due to the same problem. I took the vehicle to the local Jeep dealer who once again said it was the window regulator. Since it had been more than a year since they replaced the regulators with genuine Mopar parts it was no longer under warranty. What's more, they price of the regulators had gone up. I would have to pay almost $800.00 to have both window regulators replaced. Chrysler declined my request for an amicable remedy. While the first customer service rep. said she was certain Chrysler would reimburse me for the repairs last year, and pay to have the window regulators installed now, her Senior Rep. declined to assist with any of the charges. According to the Senior Rep., it's not covered under warranty....not their problem. To paraphrase, I should have gotten the extended warranty. Now the Jeep has too many miles since last repairs were done on windows. I also have a problem with the airbag light coming on intermittently. It stays on for a few minutes each time. I refused to pay the local Jeep dealer to repair it because it seemed to be a recall issue. They explained there was a recall on 2002 Jeep Liberty regarding the air bag light, but my problem was different. When I refused to pay to have it fixed, they gave me a copy of the invoice with their disclaimer stating, Customer was made aware of the serious safety risks if air bag warning light is not repaired, but refused service. When asked if Chrysler felt this air bag problem represented a significant safety hazard and concern, Chrysler's Senior Customer Service Rep. said Chrysler needed to determine what the diagnostic results found by the Jeep dealer were first. She declined to assist with this issue until they had an opportunity to do so. When I informed the Senior Rep that I was recording the conversation for my personal use, she abruptly terminated the call and stated she had not consented to having the conversation recorded. Surprise. I want a class action lawsuit filed against Chrysler. Safety is certainly not a priority or concern. The concept of customer satisfaction appears to elude them.",
"window regulator!!!!! i purchased my 2006 jeep liberty one year ago. about 2 weeks ago, my passsenger side rear window went down - yes, on it's own - and would not go up. i paid $250. to have it repaired. last week the driver side rear window went down - yep, on it's own - and will not go up. in a fit i contacted my warranty company who advised me that i have no coverage and would need to contact jeep directly. i did so and was told by jeep to get an estimate from an authorized dealer and call them back with my reference number. thinking (hoping and praying) that i was going to get some assistance with my expenses, i called back with my estimate amount and reference number and lo and behold i'm told that jeep won't do anything about it. one of the MANY excuses they used is that there are too many miles on the vehicle. EXCUUUUUSE ME?!?! what does the mileage have to do with the window regulator?!?! last time i checked, i drive my vehicle on the tires - not the windows! this is an outrage!! i work in a customer service business - if i provide substandard products or services, i make right on it. jeep needs to step up - they, along with massive numbers of other companies, have the American public by the purse strings! i agree with many of these other complaints - something drastic - a woman getting raped or a child being killed by falling out of one of these windows - is going to have to happen and jeep will have to get sued before they do anything about it.",
"I was driving back from church 9/14/08 when the next thing I know is that I have landed in a ditch, my Jeep kept going through the ditch, cross a road and finally coming to a stop in another ditch. I had a very hard time controlling the vehicle, it seemed that the further I went the faster the vehicle went. I was only driving about 30-35, so after hitting the first ditch (2-3 ft) the jeep should have stopped. I honestly do not know what happened. The road is a two way street, kind of narrow. Once all was said and done, I have a busted right front tire, radiator is busted and who knows what else. It is at the shop now. When my husband showed up to look at the damage he was amazed. I showed him where the ditches were that I went through, and he said that it looked liked I was going about 80 mph!! I know I was not going that fast, the road is a narrow back road that I have travelled many times, PLUS, right before the 1st ditch that I landed in, is a one way small bridge. You have to be crazy to be going that fast.",
"My 2001 Jeep excellerates when stopping and has a slow take off when excerlating. I stopped at a traffic light when applying the brakes the Jeep excerlated. I had to again apply the brakes. I never know when it is going to stop. The transmission light has come on and a gas cap was relaplaced when this first happened but now the excellerations have started again. I am afraid to drive the car close to any other car because I don't know if the Jeep will just take off. Also, the Jeep stalls when taking off or excellarating.",
"The front passenger window made a popping sound and now the window no longer moves. Upon doing research, I found out that this happens to alot of Jeep owners. And I believe that this could be a potential safety issue and that there should be a recall or that that Chrysler should compensate those that this problem happnens to.",
"I have had my JEEP Commander brand new since 2006-there have been no other drivers beside me. I've had no previous accidents or problems for almost two years with this JEEP. This summer my husband was filing the JEEP with gas and a woman came flying across the parking lot into the back of the JEEP. The JEEP was obviously in park and turned off but the crash sent the car flying 50 feet forward and it was still rolling as my husband jumped in to stop it. My 4 year old daughter and dog were luckily okay and belted in still. The car was repaired and the woman who caused the accident cited. Since I had no other problems to this point I am not sure if what happened next was a result of the recent accident or an original mechanical malfunction of the JEEP. The one thing that is certain is that no one wants to write anything thing down about the JEEP lurching forward without warning. So, the story... Just a few days ago while I was in the bank parking lot I had a crazy accident. My JEEP, after backing up, suddenly surged forward right toward the curb and slammed the curb. It hit so hard and went so fast I thought I was going to crash right into the bank. A bank teller ran out horrified and my daughter was screaming. No one was hurt. Luckily no one was in front of the car or it would have killed them. The teller saw the car excellerate unbelievably fast and couldn't believe we were okay. I have never had anything happen like this and have been driving for 22 years. I am really afraid of the car.",
"Picked up my Jeep Liberty-everything was fixed under warranty correctly. However, a week later the left rear window regulator went up. I know it's covered under warranty, but I keep reading in Car Survey and Consumer Affairs, so many people are having the same problem time after time. 
      There should be national recall to find out why this is happening. Chrysler must be aware of so many complaints. I can't blame the dealers, after all they are using the parts sent to them by Chrysler.Window fell-worried about rain getting into my vehicle. Without a vehicle to use. So many problems with such a new vehicle.",
"2006 Jeep Liberty - have had 2 window rgulators replaced under warranty - Jeep is now out of warranty and 2 more window regulators broke - when fixed originally under warranty they admitted problems with windows.... Now Chrysler customer service is claiming they have no complaints.

"I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty Limited Edition in August of 2007.  It had 25,000 miles on it.  So far, I have had to have three window regulators replaced, and the air conditioning fixed.  I did not know the window regulator was a problem until I took my jeep to be fixed for the third time.  I am so disgusted with Chrysler/Jeep.  They definitely do not stand by their product.  It is only a matter of time before someone is injured because of these regulators. 
      The least of my worries is that my jeep will be stolen!   I see a lot of women who drive Libertys, or just Jeeps in general, and I am sure like me they are afraid that one day after running errands they are going to find a stranger in their vehicle.  I work in a jail, and my Jeep is parked in the employee parking lot, however the inmates are released close by.  In daytime hours maybe the danger is not so high, but at night time, this could definitely be an issue if the regulator fails while I'm at work, which it has the last two times, both rear windows within two weeks of each other.  I'm afraid to really go anywhere and park it, I can't keep anything in it that I value or that would identify me or where I live.  I think it's sad that as much as people are encouraged to buy American, when we do, we get such a shoddy product and even shoddier treatment from the manufacturer.  Does someone have to lose their life, a woman get raped, or a child fall out of the window, before Chrysler will act!  I will NEVER buy another vehicle from Chrysler.  I think that the least they could do, since they know the regulators are bad is have a disclaimer for people so that they can make an informed choice as to whether they want to buy a Jeep.  The consumer is totally being taken advantage of.",
"My Jeep Liberty's driver seat heated to the point where it melted a line in my wifes polar fleece vest & left a line on the seat where the color transfered from the vest to the seat.

"I have just had the window regulator of the third window go bad in less than a year. Fist two cost me over $300 each to have repaired and when I called the dealer to get a price to fix this one because I was in another state and felt desparate to get it repaired, they told me between $400-$500 to fix it. I feel screwed by Jeep/Chysler and the repair shops. I settled for good old duck tape for the time being. It is the rear/driver side window which I am finding it hard to even find the part online. What does this tell me???? That there are an awful lot of people having the same problem if you can't get the part. Dealers and other repair shops are charging well over $200 just for the part. Save your self some money and don't put it there pokets, keep it in yours. Online parts companies are selling these parts for $60-$120 depending on which window needs repair. Ironically, the one that is in most demand is the highest priced. So in the long run, the internet companies are jumping on the money train as well, but it is still cheaper. I hear it is easy to repair, so gentlemen, do it yourself ,and for us women, if we don't want to try and tackle the job, I am sure there is a friend or family member who will step up to the plate and get the job done. Shame on Jeep/Crysler and all the rip off repair shops taking advantage of this situation!!!!",
"I too have a defective window regulator.  I have an extended warranty, but I paid $1500 for that with a $100 deductable.  Why should I even have to pay the $100 if this is a known problem.  Shame on you Jeep or Daimler Chrylser or whoever makes these things.  I would like to be involved with a class action lawsuit if one is filed.",
"I was driving home from work and tried to roll up the front driver side window when I heard a loud pop.  I thought the glass had actually broken.  When I tried to roll the window up again it would not move.  I had to replace the regulator in the window because the cable had broken.  That was about 2 weeks ago. 
      Yesterday, 8/21/08 the front driver side window did the same thing.  This will be the second regulator that I will have to have put in.  The cost for repair is a over $300.  This is the second expense for the same thing in less than 30 days.  I am not happy about this.  If the manufacturer is getting all of these complaints they should really do something.  I am having to pay out approximately $600 in repairs for a the same issue.",
"I bought my 2007 Jeep Liberty Sport in May 2007 because I thought it would be a dependable car that would last. I sister had a 1989 with over 200,000 miles when she traded it in. That was a different company making them I failed to remember. I also have the window problem. I live in the desert, I don't open my windows often. The was a year old and had 6100 miles when they broke. The dealer told me it always happens. How can you keep building a problem into the car unless you know it will be a source of income for you dealerships?? If they break again and Jeep won't pay for it when it's out of warranty, I will be finding someplac other then Jeep dealership to have them repaired. Next time I get the Toyota.",
"I bought a Jeep Liberty in 2004 and during the last 2 years 3 out of 4 windows have quit working , Today I went out to my Liberty and the passenger rear window was  part way down. I turned on the ignition and the window motor made a grinding sound like the other 2 that are not working . I have looked at the recall information,there is nothing listed. I frrl that there should be a class action law suit against Chrysler over these windows problems , I have researched and found that they are aware of this problem and will not do anything to remedy the problem.
      I have used tie wraps to hold the windows up. I will not pay for motors or part replacement untill I plan to sell this Jeep Liberty.",
This is my second time replacing my window regulator in the last 5 months on my 2004 Jeep Liberty. Not to bad based off of some of the complaints I've read on this forum. So are we ever going to see a recall/class action lawsuit on these defective window regulators?,
"In May 2008 the steering column bracket on my 2001 Jeep Cheroke broke off resulting in my not being able to steer the car.  Fortunately I was in a parking lot and not on the highway.  The car had to be towed to a garage.  As of today, August 15, 2008 the car is still waiting for the bracket from Chrysler.  After placing MANY, MANY calls to Chrysler I've been told the part has to be made by their supplier and they have no idea when that will be.  
      I've been waiting 3 months now, paying for a rental car on my own with no idea how long I will have to wait.  It is very frustrating not to get any kind of answers the only thing they can tell me is to just wait for the part to come in.  Any help to resolve this issue would be appreciated.                                                              Fortunately the car did not crash which it would have done had I been on the street when it happened.  So far I've had to rent a car for 3 months not to mention the aggravation of having to call Chysler every couple of days for a status update which is always the same.  Not available.",
"The news in past few months about Jeep Commander SUVs stalling out is nothing new. I have 2003 Jeep Liberty - same exact problem. Dealers don't fix it - they just replace sensors which appears to be the middle of the problem. Somethign is causing either wrong fuel/air mix or short circuits and sensors are failing (in my case - 3 seqentially in past 3 months - can't be right for car with 60K.) The computer module is thought to have thermal damage and needs replacement - big ticket for Chrysler for all those Jeep customers. As problem worsens, stalling occurs at higher speeds with same loss sterring, brakes as Commander. Some cases where all 6 ignition coils burned out as result of prolonged failure to fix problem.",
"own a 2004 jeep liberty the window regulators have been replaced 15 times since it was new.they have no reason for me justbring it back each time happens all the time i have the jeep part warranty for one year on each part so it covers the windows but now my front window broke again its been a year and one monthg and they want me to pay for it. 
      isnt there a lemon law or recall? once or twice i can understand but 15 times i have been there three times already this year.what do i do? i bought the car with 12 miles on it and i shouldnt have to deal with this .am i being taken advantage of because i am a woman? the service advisor blows me off and saysit happensi have missed alot of work for this because they dont even offer to come get it from my work. its the least they could do.",
"Purchased vehicle in 2004 in Dec 2007 passenger side window dropped and stopped working. Not 6m later while driving I went to let up drivers side and heard a loud pop or exploding noise. The window slid down into door. 
      Will have to pay to get both sides repaired now. Had to drive on 99 degree day with window down with my kids in back seat. Why is there no recall on this? I just read about same thing happening to someone else- both doors-- on the main page of this website.",
"My 2006 Jeep Commander was involved in an on accident on I-40 near Statesville on 3/29/07 with an intoxicated driver parked in the center of the highway after having beed tangled in the cable barrier. The other driver was charged with DWI and lane violation. State Farm recommended Bell and Howard as their preferred provider for that area. There was $14,884.37 damage done to my vehicle. Bell and Howard preformed the repairs. Before accepting my vehicle I had State Farm send an appraiser to verify all repairs had been preformed in an acceptible manner. I was told everything looked good.
      I drove the vehicle for 16 months with wind noises from the previously damaged passenger side front and rear doors and wind noise from the winshield. During that time I returned it once to the body shop to only have it come back with worst noise.On July 1,2008  I had a third party investigate where the problems were. It was discovered that the doors could not fit properly due to bowing of the front and rear pillars. Upon further investigation it was found that many structural welds had been done and not primed and painted as required by the maufaturer but most shocking and dangerous was that the passenger side front frame rail had been sectioned and steel welding into the area where the frame rail had been damaged. This is not allowed by the manufacurer. Their only acceptible method to retain their designed crumple zone was repacing the frame rail. On July 3,2008 a State Farm adjuster inspected the vehicle and would not allow it to be driven, deemed it unsafe to operate and wrote it up as a total loss. Basically I operated an unsafe vehicle for 16 months because of unethical and dangerous hidden repairs that compromised the crumple zone/ safety restaint system of the vehicle. The dealership/body shop seem to feel that wasn't a problem and basically thumbed their nose that I was owed anthing by their incompitence.  The amount that State Farm paid was less than the payoff, I incurred rental car fees, drove to and from the third party inspector's shop numerous times and had other out of pocket expeses that the dealer/body shop refused to pay. My biggest concern is how many other vehicles and families has this shop sent out the door with unsafe hidden repairs",
"I bought a 2006 jeep commander and have had many problems with the control panel and computer system., Last time-still in shop day 5 car stalled completely while traveling 55 no lights no nothing. Dangerous. The Jeep dealer in Maine where it was towed while I was on vacation said he wouldn't even drive it not knowing if it will do it again. Chrysler needs to own up to its [poor] work and take the vehicle off the road.
      I have had to borrow and rent cars every time the car goes into the shop. I am paying 50 bucks a day while Jeep still tries to figure out what to do. I am still paying my whopping car payment without driving it. Thank God on this stalling event no one was hurt.",
"I purchased a preowned certified  2006 Jeep Commander in June 2008. A few weeks later while on vacation in Baja California, Mexico my brakes failed while exiting a main highway and the vehicle skidded into a ditch.  While researching Commanders online, I found that in 2007 a recall was issued for the break system.  
      I contacted the delearship to ask why this recall had not been performed prior to selling this certified vehicle.  I was given a verbal apology, told to take the vehicle to any Jeep delearship to perform the recall fix and call Chrysler's 800 for any further system.  I called to file my complaint and was told by an outsourced rep located somewhere in Asia that Chrysler could only be responsible for the recall fix and no other damages.I had to to repair approximately $950 in damages and nearly $800 in towing. I can provide a receipts upon request.",

"I am a Single mother of three, I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty Sport. My Jeep has 105,000 Miles and Has had all recalls fixed. And oil/preventative maintenance done as suggested.  About 2 weeks ago I went to start the jeep and it made a clicking sound as the rpms were raised. I thought it was low on oil but I just had the oil changed 2 weeks prior. So I took it in and wow I was surprised the Crank shaft Barrings and cylinders are bad.  So I have to replace the engine.  I Love my jeep and I can't afford to replace the engine $4500.00 is what it will cost.  And to top that off its hard to find an engine due to the fact they are bad.  I have had a lot of vehicles and I never had to replace the engine.  This is ridiculous!  Im up against loosing my job! Because my job depends on a vehicle, Has anybody else had a similar experiance",
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Liberty and within two months, my driver side window broke, the cable broke. Went in and got it fixed, again with the passanger front side window and again a few months later with the driver side passanger window. Now at 36,480 the driver side broke again. No one wants to fix it at the dealer (I didnt buy the X warreny) and now I have to pay for it. I'm just upset that this is a know problem and nothing is being done about it.",
"I bought my Jeep Liberty brand new in 2005. My first big life purchase. I have had it for 3 years and have put 71,000 miles on it. A few weeks ago, the engine light went on. Took it in for service and they say that 3 coils on the left side of the engine broke. Cost to repair $2000. They repair it, only to find that the noise did not stop. They must now go back in to determine what the noise is. Now, they determine that some other engine part has broken and the cost to repair that is $5800. Total $7,800. For a car that is only 3 years old, it should not be having these problems. I called the 1-800 number for help and was pretty much told that I was on my own. I find this to be very poor service and a very poor quality car. When I bought the Jeep I expected to have it for a long time. Now, I am stuck with a $7,800 repair bill and still owe $10,000. I will never again buy a Jeep. I am paying on a car that is not driveable and has been in the repair shop for 26 days. Other dealerships stand by their cars, why doesn't Chrysler Jeep???",
"My Jeep 2003 has had numerous issues with it, including the transmission failing & 8 recalls the dealer NEVER notified me of. I found out about them when the transmission went out - it stalled on the freeway. In may the power steering fluid pump & a hose broke and it cost me over 1K to get it fixed. I'd only had the car back for a couple of weeks & only driven it 3 times when it died on me again. This time it was on the freeway during the morning rush hour. There was a clunk, a grinding noise & then all of my lights came on & the vehicle lost all power. When it was towed back into the service department at Hayward Chysler Jeep , they told me there was a sensor in the transaxle that needed to be replaced. About an hour later they called me again & tried to tell me I also needed to have all of my spark plugs & points replaced at an additional cost of $800.00. I told them no, a sensor going out should have nothing to do with my spark plugs. We went to pick up the Jeep & it barely made it home. It shakes & dies & is now un-driveable. I still have 2 yeras of payments left on this lemon & I will never buy a jeep again.",
"I have now had to take my car in for two broken window regulators. The windows simply stop working while in the down position or slowly slide down when not being used and then never go back up again. Today when I took my car to the dealership to repair the second window, I asked that the remaining 2 be inspected so that I would not have to bring the car back when the other 2 inevitably break. The service manager, Erik, said no, he cannot fix them until the break (sure, by then the warantee will have expired). He did comment that the new regulators that Jeep makes are better, which leads me to believe the Jeep knows this is a problem and has fized it, but refuses to issue a recall. I have read online thousands of other people have had this exact same problem   Chrystler/Jeep needs to take some accountability for this! I have now had to take my car in to the shop twice to be left there all day for these repairs. Once the window breaks, while I am waiting for a service appointment, I have had to leave my car unsecured with a window down, parked on a public street, when I go to work, putting me at risk for theft or damage.",
About 40-50 times my jeep has lost power and made grinding noises and I have had to pull off the road or Freeway. Once I stop I am able to start up agian with no issues for awhile and then after bfrom several miles to many maile it will happen again. I took my jeep to the dealer (Don A VEE) in October 2007 and they say they replaced some faulty comuper parts. but some after that it started again.. after several month the power loss is / has gotten worse .

"I own a 2007 Jeep Liberty. On July 8, 2008 I was stopped at a stop light, when all of a sudden my car accelerated, crashing into the car in front of me, pushing her around the corner. I had both feet planted on the breaks and the car would not stop for about a half a block. I had the vehicle towed into Baxter, because I wa afraid to drive it. They told me that they had to reprogram the electronic throttle control. I have pulled articles off of the internet, where there are numerous stories about this happening. The lst article was December 2007, that states the NHTSA identified no indication of a safety defect trend that could cause unintended acceleration in these vehicles. I have not gone back to pick the car up yet, but I would like to know if if anything at all is being done against Jeep, and if they are looking into the problem. Can they guarantee me that this will not happen again, and maybe kill me or someone else. If someone could just let me know if the NHTSA is going to look into this again or is currently looking into it I would appreciate it.",
"I am filing a complaint over my 2006 Jeep Commander Limited, 4.7L. The stalling issue discussed on this website is affecting my car as well. The dealer has looked at it and has found no solution. All they tell us is it is a result of poor design. That is unacceptbale, my wife drives this car and her safety is at risk.

That afternoon, the anti-theft device again kicked in.

"My husband bought our jeep liberty 08 in march and a few days ago it went crazy when I went to start it. The engine started but the windshield wipers would not shut off, the lights wouldnot turn off the car would not shift at all. I called jeep and had it towed. It's been 3 days and they don't know what's wrong yet. They won't give me my rental car I need till they diagnose the problem. They also have 30 cars to fix and one tech. My husband and I and our 4 year old all share 1 car, now what do I do?I don't have extra money to pay for a rental. I purchased extra insurence for a rental in this type of situation. Also as soon aswe left the lot wth the jeep we found out there were problems.

"I have a 2002 Jeep Liberty. I bought it new. The first thing to go down was the windows control panel, that was replaced before the warrenty expired. The second to go was the arms that lift the drivers side window.This cost me 400 dollars to repair. Now it's been 2 months and the passager side window broke. I take very good care of my Jeep. I only have 42,000 thousand miles on it. I'm the only one to drive it and there are no kids to cause the damage as kids will do. The CD player went down at about 30,000 miles. I love driving my Jeep but I have never had these problems in any other car at this early stage. As of today I would NOT recommend that anyone buy this product.You should tell your workers , if they want job security, how about making a product that will last , at least, 50,000 miles. For the price I paid, I should get a much better product !!! I don't think I will ever buy another american made car !!As far as your extended warrenty, the price I paid for it ,your regular warrenty should cover this. I know to you I'm just another whinner!!

"My 2004 Jeep Liberty won't start. It is on totally random occasions and seems to have something to do with the security system. We purchased the Jeep in March 2008 and this problem started 2 days after we drove it off the lot. We purchased it from a Hyundai dealership and they thought the problem was the starter so it was in the shop for 4 days to get that fixed. The next day I drove around to do some errands and at one of my stops it wouldn't start again. You turn the key and the starter clicks and that's it the screen below my speedometer then says done. Everything else in the car works (radio, windows etc)so I called the dealership again and they arranged to have a tow truck come get me. While i was waiting for 20 min. I tried again to start it and it worked, so I drove strait to the dealership and wanted to show them the problem but of coursr it started fine. i insisted they keep it till it was fixed so they sent it over to one of the local chrysler dealerships. They had it for 2 weeks and would try to start it and everything was fine, I told them some of the things that seemed to trigger the problem bt none of that seemed to work either. Eventually the mechanic asked if he could take it home over night to see if it would do it, sure enogh he was late for work the next morning because of the issue. They figred it was the computer module and a week later i got it back and it seemed fine. until about 2 weeks ago it started again and it is getting more and more frequent now too. Another odd thing that is happening this time is when the key is not in the ignition you can still open and close the power windows, but only when the car won't start. Anyone else having this kind of issue??",

"Driving my 2002 Jeep Liberty to the Atlanta airport. The oil light came on while I was on the surface roads of the airport. Within 3 minutes of the light coming on I lost all steering and the car died. Called the police, had the car towed to my service station. The station owner said that he believed that the oil pump broke and that is what caused the engine to die. I called Chrysler and was told to have it towed to a dealership which I did. After having my car for 4 days got a call from the dealer saying that the chrysler adjustor had denied my warranty claim due to sludge in the engine. My claim was denied despite the fact that i had a 7 year 70,000 mile powertrain warranty and the car was 6 years old with approx. 57,000 miles.

"Today was the last straw. My manager was almost killed by a jeep surge as we call them at the car wash i work at called PDQ. I am 18 years old and almost witnessed the death of a manager. She was pulling a jeep off of our track and because we keep the cars in neutral as they are washed, put it into drive as usual and was suprised by a sudden surge. She avoided cars in our 2nd lane of cars (we have three) and pulled to the 3rd lane surging out of control out the garage door, over a large curb with grass, into a busy road, across the curb across the street ending up in the parking lot (about 150 yards for the building) before getting it to stop. At PDQ we take strong action to make sure we are safe when it comes to jeeps. We must call over the intercom when one is in the building and turn on the hazard lights before driving. Only managers are allowed to drive. This was not the only PDQ incident. In another WI store earlier this winter, a girl pulled the jeep off of the track and quickly shot over to the intended 3rd lane smashing into the car in front of her, totalling it, pushing it through the glass door out to the parking lot totally both cars and nearly NEARLY killing a young woman by a hair. Imagine the number of young teens that must witness near DEATH and INJURY experiances. Horrible. Today was the day i decide i need to do something about this. Jeep and Highway control say nothing is wrong and that is COMPLETELY WRONG. If other models were crashing into walls at local car washes (even though some accidents/driver related do happen) were other than jeeps? i may not question it so heavily. this needs to stop. if anyone can help, please contact me.",
"I have owned my 2007 Jeep Commander for about ten months now.  The problem I have is when my knee bumps the bottom of the ignition key (turning it to the left, & shutting the vehicle off) which is unusually located at the bottom portion of the console (I guess this vehicle wasn't meant for tall people). When this happens the vehicle immediately shuts off, causing the power steering to shut off as well. This has happened four times now.  The last time it happened was Thursday, June 12, 2008 around 11:15 am. I was driving my 1 year old son to the babysitter's house. My knee bumped the key as I was approaching a turn, shutting off the vehicle/power steering, so I kept going straight, and nearly crashed. Luckily, I slammed the brakes and stopped just in time.  After this incident I realized how serious the problem really is. Although I have to drive it at the moment (backwards, so I can't afford to trade it in), I have become leery and uncomfortable with my Commander because of what could happen to my child, me, or someone else if (or rather when) this happens again. I am now constantly trying to stay aware of where my right knee is at all times.  Instead of reporting this to my dealership (I know they can't do anything about design flaws). I have decided to go straight to the NHTSA and consumer affairs.  I just found out that tons of people are reporting that their Jeep Commanders stall without warning. I wonder if they will realize that it is their knee bumping the ignition key that is the problem.  I really need to find an attourney who can help me asap, please!",

"I was driving down the road and I was unable to accelerate my 2007 Jeep Commander. I looked at the gas gage to find out that it said it was on E. I thought that was odd because I had just put 30.00 into the gas tank. I was passing by a gas station and turned in real quick. I then noticed my gages that told me the outside temp was black and all other electronical things were off. Then as I was turning into the gas station the power steering locked up on me and I almost ran directly into the gas pumps. I slammed on my breaks and was able to stop in time. When the power steering locked up thats when I realized the car had just turned off pervious and it wasnt the gas. I put the car in park, turned the key all the way off and restarted the car. The car started right back up again. This is only one of a few problems Im having in regards to the car going out of control.",
"at about 37000 miles i was hereing a noise when i would brake, i took it to the dealer under waranty they had to replace the whole front end, this 2005 grand cherekee had never even been near the woods or any rough terrain. at about 52000 miles the front rotars warped and had to have them replaced at my cost of 400 dollars. also at about 44000 miles the starter went on it, had to have it replaced. and at about 56000 miles one of the transmission cooler lines began to leek and had to have it replaced. so far if its any consolation it only stauled out one time. oh and one other thing at about 48000 miles i had new tires put two days later all four tires kept loosing air i had to stop and put air in every two days. I took it back to where i  bought the tires and after taking the tires off the aluminum aloy rims I was told that a bumpy rust had built up inside the rims where the tires get there bead to seal off the air. they had to wire brush these rust bumps down the best they could and apply a rubber adheisive around the inside of the rim to make the tires seal properly. And there was also a high speed balancing problem because off these terible factory jeep rims. Its ashame that crysler gets away with making a piece of junk and pawning it off on consumers and nothing is done about it. I work hard for what i have, but i cant afford to get rid of this jeep and buy another dependeble vihicle, so i suppose im stuck with this garbage grand cherekee until i can afford to sell it off and buy a dependable vehicle. I will never buy another crysler product again the rest of my life after i get rid of this junk Im stuck with for now.

"Junk.  That is what Jeep produces...Junk.  I have an 03 Liberty.  The O2 sensors have already gone bad...that's a big chunk of change and an engine light that won't extinguish.  Also, my left rear door window just decided yesterday to FALL OFF THE RAIL.  Have you ever heard of a Toyota doing this ?  NO YOU HAVEN'T.  I pray for the day that Jeep goes out of business.

"Since purchasing my 2006 Jeep Commander from this dealership NEW two years ago, I have had countless issues with random stalling while the vehicle is in operation. I have had the vehicle into the service department for days on end, many times only to be told there is nothing wrong. I was nearly killed when the vehicle stalled while travelling out of state with my children on a  highway in central Oklahoma,during a rainstorm and going about 70+ mph. I was stranded out of town. When I finally made it home days later. The dealership laughed it off and said I must be hitting the ignition with my knee.Most recently, they made me feel like I was just being a hysterical female when I said I did not feel safe in the vehicle and would not drive the car on the highway to bring it in during the last reported incident. I then tried to contact Chrysler about the Lemon Law and they only responded with a form letter- saying they were sorry to hear of my inconvenience,blah, blah.....! Today,a friend sent a link to your story about this safety recall by Chrysler. I have been ignored for 2 years and have never been notified of this....Considering, I refuse to drive on a highway with my children in the vehicle- and have had to live this way AND until some day when I am not upside down in my loan to trade it in (if that is even possible with its issues)I am incredibly unhappy that they have now taken a select few vehicles and issued a recall. What about the rest of us 2006 Commander owners who have been fighting this losing battle - and risking our safety for over 2 years now!Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated.",
"I purchased a 2004 Jeep Liberty Limited. I drove the car for three weeks with no problems. One day as I pulled into the driveway of my aunt's home the jeep suddenly accelerated and ran into her vehicle.

I sent it to be inspected at a local Jeep dealership/body shop and they say that ""there is nothing wrong with the Liberty.""

"I purchased a 2008 Jeep Patriot (brand new). I've only had the vehicle three weeks. The head liner in the vehicle is loose and slaps/vibrates violently against the roof of the car when a window is down. It first started with all the windows up except one rear window. It sounds like a helicopter is flying inside the vehicle. After a week of driving since I first encountered the problem, it has gotten worse. It now does it with any window down to varying degrees, depending on the window and how far down it is placed. 
      The noise and vibration can be stopped by holding upward pressure on the head liner. I have gone back and forth between the dealer and Chrysler's customer service for over a week now. I was told that they all do it and that it is a design feature, it's normal. I have been back to the dealer three times and spent countless hours on the phone trying to resolve this. I have been told that Chrysler will not fix it and that I can pay to have it fixed if I want to (brand new car, lifetime warranty).",
"i purchased a certified pre owned vehicle on 4/7/08 when i got in the car the check engine light was on as well as the fuel light....yes, they gave me the truck with no gas. they took me to their mechanic right away and he put the light out and said it was probably because it was sitting fo a while. on 4/10/08 the service engine light came on again and i brought the truck in for service on 4/11/08 i was given a loaner car and was stuck with out my new truck until the night of 4/15/08 they also lied about the tires that were on the truck when i bought it......they said the rear tires were o.k, but when i went to a local service station they said there was no way it should have passed a new york state inspection and the dealer should not have sold the car with those tires. when i picked up the car the service engine light was out but they didi not change the tires. i had to come back after work on 4/17/08 to get the tires replaced. all was good until 5/2/08 when the drivers side speaker started cutting out and coming back on when i made a turn......then i noticed after it rained that there was a puddle of water under my rear seat and the carpet was soaked...i made an appt for service and was told that they have a leak specialist there every thursday to fix the leaking cars. i brought my truck in for service on 5/8/08 to fix the water leak and also replace the third brake light housing that had a slight crack in it.....very hard to see. i was told i would get the car back the same day and then they called me later and said their leak guy could not fix it and they had to send it out and i should be able to get it the next day (friday) friday they called in the late afternoon and said i would get it back saturday. saturday i called and was told that my truck was in the spray booth because the roofline had to be tweeked and the roof had to be painted. monday came and nobody called me so i called again on tuesday and was told it was ready and i could pick up any time. i went there after work and the job they did was unacceptible.....the truck had 2 new scratches on it...my brand new bedliner that cost me $675.00 was covered in some kind of dust from the body shop as well as my carpet along with footprints, a lucky five dollar bill that i had in a storage compartment was gone, and the third brake light lens that was replaced was sitting flush in one side and sticking out 1/4 inch on the other. i went back inside and got jake and he got the autobody guy. the autobody body guy said it must be from damage done prior to me buying the truck.......but the original light was completely flush. he said the only way to properly fix it was to cut out that section of the roof and replace it. i said that the work was not acceptable and refused to take the truck. i was put in anothe loaner that is covered in dog hair and was on my way. this all took place on 5/13/08 while all of this was going on i had tried to get in touch with chris the sales manager and he has not returned my call. i called him on 5/10/08 and he was not in....i spoke to robert figat the finance maqnager and he said he would give the message.it is now 5/13/08 and still have not been contacted by chris. please help me!",
"I have a 2006 jeep liberty, this vehicle is nothing but junk! Looks wise it is great! Love the jeep, been a faithful customer, but bought this one new, expecting no problems and that is all i have had!  The vehicle DIES at various speeds, doesn't seem to be triggered by any one thing, dealer has had in it several times, tells me nothing is wrong, have small children, this vehicle is not safe. Dies at all speeds, times and road conditions. I have called Chrysler Customer Service and they tell me to call the attorney generals office, who tells me to file a lemon law claim, which Chrysler won't recognize! They won't talk to you on the phone to resolve the claim, they simply hang up filed a claim with national transportation safety board the claim # is 10226959. WE need to get the word out so jeep will solve this problem before some is seriously injured or killed!",
Problems with stalling when driving.Everything just completely shuts down and I am unable to steer and have to re-start the engine.This has happened 3-4 times now and the dealer says there is nothing they can find wrong with my vehicle.It happened again today while in a parking lot.,
"I have a 1997 Jeep Laredo that I purchased over 2 years ago from a used car dealer. The stalling problem started around January 2008. At first it just stalls when on idle or when turning. Now it is stalling while driving on the freeway/highway. I was going 60mph on the highway and it just died. We have changed the crack sensor, the oil, coil, cap and rotor, transmission fuild. Oxygen sensor was changed a little over a year ago. I don't know what else to do. I have brought it to the mechanic 2x and he can't find the problem. No warning code shows on the dash. I searched the web and discovered I'm not alone. It is now April 2008 and I'm scared to drive my car. What can we Jeep owners with the same problem do? There must be something we can do to get Chrysler to fix this problem. There is a recall but it doesn't cover the year of my car.",
I have had my jeep in and out of the shop in regards to it stalling all of a sudden.Each possibility proposed to me is not a sure fix and very expensive.Also the lights in my jeep like to dim out some times when I am driving.My anti loc brakes are down also now and I can only use them as reg. breaks. All of these things are very dangerous to me.It is my only vehicle to drive so I use it. I have read about other jeeps stalling. This needs to be addressed.,
"I purchased my 03' Jeep from a dealer in 06'. I bought it at what i thought was a very fair price(now i know why). Almost immediately, i had problems with the fan relay switch.Which by the way is under the passenger side headlamp, which is about 2 inches from the fender side of the of the headlamp cavity in the middle. This is important information because the part itself costs about $35.00 and the dealer will tell you they need to take the whole front end of the car apart.They do not need to rip the car apart.They fix the problem in 10 to 15 minutes by drilling into the headlamp assembly like I had already mentioned before. Then they charge you BIG money in labor to have your Jeep sit in the back of the lot all day.DO NOT FALL PREY TO THAT SCAM. My buddy who is a mechanic told me that scam  when I had him change my relay.    The alternator stopped working and my battery died about two weeks later and that was even more money about $300.00 down the drain.The tires need to be filled back up every 2 to 3 days because the cheap aluminum oxidizes and creates a hole between the tire bead and the rim for all the air to escape(that is annoying) about 4 months later the entire cooling system failed and litteraly exploded in my car.I ended up replacing the radiator,the dumb fan relay AGAIN,heater core,and the thermostat to the tune of $2000.00.I replaced the radiator on warranty from the initial explosion twice and to this day,a solid year later the thing still leaks.the mechanic will warranty the radiator but wants to charge me for the labor. I believe they get paid by the company to do warranty work so i wont let them touch it again for that reason(I think the mechanic is lying to me about the supposed charge) and because he has  done the radiator and all its components atleast 2 times already with NO positive results.    They also put in 2 thermostats and I can still hear fluids running through the heater core and that can't be good. To this very day the trucks heater blows cold air to luke warm air in the winter rendering the heater utterly useless.In the past couple months it has developed a problem with the steering(as if there is  anything else that could go wrong). The vehicle no longer turns left easily. My friend the mechanic told me it's the steering shaft.We changed it and the problem was still there. That was $250.00 down the drain. Then a jeep mechanic told MY mechanic, it is the ball joints. We changed them and the problem is still better than ever.It was a good thing i changed them because They were falling apart in the sockets.Nevertheless, that was another $185.00 down the drain. Now we think we have found the real culprate. We believe it is the steering gear box.The gear box is expensive about 350.00 plus labor to install.I have also replaced a front left and rear left brake calipers because the had seazed at different times but whats another 350.00 dollars right!!!! I have huge cracks down to the foam in my leather seats,adding insult to injury    I want the folks and workers at Chrysler/Jeep to know that I owned a full size Mitsubishi Montero sport for YEARS and almost 300,000 miles and I replaced the brakes,tires and oil as i should and replaced the alternator at about 250,000 miles. I will NEVER purchase another cheap jeep EVER again or an American car in general.I will be going back to foreighn cars. What a collosal disappointment this has been oh by the way MUCHO expensive",
"I bought a jeep liberty in full by cheque and the same day I began to have problems with the car there was smoke coming out of the back wheel,oil was leaking from underneath the car,the c.d. player was making a weird noise.so I called the dealer and told him I want to bring the car back and that I want my cash back and he won't do it unless I leave him with $4,200 and I paid $11,5000 for the car.",
"I bought a 2003 Jeep Liberty in March of 2003. Since that time, I have had it in to the local dealership to have the back window regulators replaced six times. The last two times have been after the warranty expired and the dealership has given me a hard time about replacing them for free. There is an obvious problem with them as my back windows are never rolled down, but the window just falls into the door. I have looked on the internet and discovered that other Jeep owners have the same problem. I have called Chrysler and they say there is nothing they can do for me until it happens again and then they might recommend a partial adjustment to help me pay for the repairs. I requested something in writing stating that Chrysler would pay to have the window regulators replaced for the life of the vehicle and they said they would never do that. Chrysler should have to fix the defective part and have a recall on all models affected or a class action lawsuit should be filed on behalf of all vehicle owners with the defective window regulators.",
"I bought a 2002 Jeep from this dealership on April 9,2008 after examining the vehicle and being given the oral assurance that the car had been thoroughly checked out by their mechanics and there were absolutely no problems with it. The car looked very clean and drove well. I noticed a sound in the engine which I asked to have them re-examine. The GM  agreed to keep the car overnight and have repaired any problem they found. Bob reported that the problem had been something to do with an oil sleeve and that they had replaced it.  We picked the car up the next day (the 10th) and drove it home. Later that day I noticed a HUGE oil spot on my driveway. I reported this immediately to the dealer and was told to bring the car in on Tuesday (the 15th). Upon doing so we were told they could do NOTHING to remedy the problem. They refuse to do ANYTHING to make the vehicle driveable. In short, I am now stuck with a repair bill for $1100 for a new radiator( which had not been disclosed as being cracked) and a rear oil seal replacement.",
"My husband bought his 2004 Jeep Liberty brand new.  He bought it for the durability of the Jeeps.  We just had it in for inspection and they now tell us that the underside of the Jeep is rusted through.  The mechanic asked my husband if in has been sitting in flood for over a year.  The Jeep has never been in a flood nor have we been off road with the Jeep.  We called the dealership where he bought the car and they are telling us there is nothing they can do.

"After having this vehicle for less than a month the check engine light comes on. I took it to Autozone for a diagnosis. They told me it was a computer memory checksum error and had little info on the particulars. I then took the vehicle to the dealer. He looks at it and then says he is going to have to keep it until the next day. I call the next day and am told that it needed a new ECM, they were on National Backorder and it would be at least a month before they would have one and then there were no guarantees on that. Amazingly enough I could find them on the internet for 115 bucks used and 320 new. I told him to put it back in and call me when he got the part (the vehicle still drove fine). I was told he could not allow the vehicle to be driven as it might be polluting!! Obviously this guy just did not want me getting service elsewhere. So it indeed took a month to get the ECM. Why are companies allowed to sell vehicles that they cannot stock parts for?? I thought there were consumer laws about this. The next issue arose when we left a restaurant before going to a wake. Had the whole family with, got in and the key would not turn. The dealer is closed (I bought the worthless service contract) so I call a locksmith. He tells me that the lock cylinders are junk, have been since 1996? or so and he services 2 - 3 per week in the Fort Wayne area. He replaced mine with an improved after-market version but he says Jeep still used the defective ones to this day. To make matters worse the service contract people refused to pay the 160 bucks because they said I should have called them and they would have sent a tow truck to take it to the dealer for repair in the morning. I told them that we would have been stranded 50 miles from home. He implied that was not their problem. I guess the biggest beef I have is the fact that they MUST know there are both design and material planning deficits and they refuse to do anything about it. As a matter of fact, they just keep right on using the junk parts.",
"06 Jeep Commander in for same problem 6 times at San Juan Capistrano Dodge/Jeep/Chrysler for getting stuck in 3rd gear, surging, stalling and a variety of other issues. The last time they tried to fix it, it is working better, but I still have the stalling and surging issues.",
"'06 jeep commander - (1) stalls intermittingly during turns which are both from moving and stopped positions. many have occured during a u-turn from a stopped position. (2) has a rough idle, which at times is more severe than others, but has never died - just shook severely a few times. it intermittingly acts as if if is going to loose all power. this can occur several times in one day, 1 time during the day or not at all for 1 or several days in a row. there is no set pattern. it occurs during cold and hot weather, with electrical devices on or off, in park/neutral/drive, if the engine has warmed up or is still cold. (3) the original stock windshield - continuous rock chips, cracks, bullseyes, etc - replaced w/ 11,000 miles with a non-jeep brand glass and to date, the new one has only 1 star chip. i believe that jeep is not using sufficient/durable glass for its windshields (4) transmission fluid leaking from adaptor O-rings - replaced (5) rear spring seats squeaking - insulators replaced (6) excessive wind noise from front passenger side - at 22,500 miles the dealership said only normal wind buff, at 24,000 miles the dealership said it's unure where it's coming from but will start repair by resealing the front windshield and then seal it again if that doesn't work and go from there, that sometimes they need to be sealed more than once (7) front driver window inoperable - motor replaced (8) short in audio/speaker syster - radio assembly replaced (9) front driver power lock motor making noise/whining during autolock in cold weather (10) back up sensor not sounding in a timely mannor (11) alert to check/repair reverse sensor appeared during the time that i found out the vehicle wouldn't start and it had to be towed ****the vehicle is in the shop again - there for 3 days so far...not advertising a hyundai, but glad i have it as a second car, especially since i bought a jeep****",
"Purchased an 2003 Jeep Liberty, from above company with an to fix list, of the front end shakes, with a gradual drifting to the right, while at low speed or at cruising speed,the named company stated that they did a front end alignment which is false for which I paid out pocket to have done at a good-year garage, also a service which also was to have been down by the above, also stated I thought the brakes are in needing changing, the right rear caliper was and still in sticking with a severe heat feeling coming from the brakes,I am very disappointed even though they are not a jeep dealer they sold a jeep product. I also purchased four new tires that was quoted to as the problem of my  shaking in the front end, well the shaking is still very much the issue along with the brakes, I have not owned this vehicle for six months!!!!!",
"My 2005 Jeep Liberty Limited has been in the body shop for 3 and a half months. It went in the shop mid Oct. They're waiting on a part from Chrysler. It's the quarter panel assembly. Driver's side. Chrysler said the part is on back order from the manufacturer. They're giving me the run around, and saying they don't know when it will be in. They won't even give me a loaner car to drive. They won't do anything for me. I'm paying for a car that I don't have. I thought they were the manufacturer. It's not an old car, and I need it back. I'm driving an old car that's about to break down. If that happens, I won't have any money to get it fixed. I already payed to have it fixed once already. Please help me get my car fixed and back.",
"My wife bought a 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport in 2002 from the dealer, had routine maintenance and even had the recall (see below) performed. Even though I believe it has to be performed again, the passenger front wheel sounds HORRIBLE, constantly vibrating, seems like the wheel will just fall off.. I dont think the ball joint issue is resolved efficiently.  Once she reached 75,000+ miles the real problems began. The vehicle light has come on consistently for the past several months. Brought it to a mechanic, said it was misfiring and 'fixed it, - however light came on again, so brought it to the dealer. They claimed he used the wrong plugs and charged her $300+ for the same thing he did and said there was a 'carbon build-up' on the valves and would be an additional $1000 approx (didnt bother with that). Left with the light off, a week later it came on again. A separate mechanic looked at it and fixed the light said it was misfiring and was then running fine. UNTIL a few weeks ago, it started a light tapping near the valves/intake and we havent driven it for fear it was going to stall (book says the trans light was flashing which means it will lose power). Yesterday it wouldnt start AT ALL; it took several tries and eventually started slooowly. I ran it for a few minutes and performed an oil change, tried 5w-30 the preferred winter weight and didnt change, still tapping. This vehicle should be recalled. WILL NEVER BUY A JEEP AGAIN.   I am going to try some additives and simple valve fixers, hoping to get it up to par to sell privately or trade for a new car.    This is a similar complaint I came across on a jeep forum: The first trip showed a misfire on Cylinder 3, all the plugs were replaced. The second trip was Oxygen sensor, it was replaced. Third trip, they claimed carbon build up, fourth trip was another misfire, 5th was Air Box. We have reset it twice this weekend, going back on Monday.  **Recall ID# 06V288000 - SUSPENSION, FRONT : CONTROL ARM : LOWER BALL JOINT",
"Went out one morning to take my kids to school in my 2006 Jeep liberty, started the jeep & clunk a loud noise occured & did not sound quite right. Had it towed to Adams Jeep for service,which is where it was purchased,was called by service dept. to let me know it was a definite engine problem & I would have to pay 4 hours of labor for them to look more in depth to what the exact engine problem was. said o.k.,at this point I could not drive it,it was dead!Service called next day & said a new engine was needed,I was given a quote of 4,900.00,I asked the mechanic if that included everything tax,labor,all parts-he said that would be the final amount. Okayed repair & engine was ordered.Asked if it was common for engines to be replaced in a vehicle with under 100,000 miles on it-Mechanic told me no, more like a vehicle with 250,000 or more miles.Mech. called to say engine was going to take a little extra time getting it in,& was offered a loaner car at there expense(which we found out later,is just a car they keep sitting around for this kind of use.) called week later and was told jeep was ready,when I re-verified the total I was told 6,100.00. Service manager said that the mechanic that was working on the car wrote on the ticket that he had called us to let us know the engine would cost a little more.I NEVER recieved a call. When I asked to speak to the mech.,I was told he was off. After argueing back in forth for quite awhile,we agreed to 4,900.00 and tax.After hearing a sob story from the service manager about the loss he was taking by settling on the price,I believe its me who suffered the bigger loss(5,100.00)I called again to speak to the mech. the next day and was told he was still off. It was not until I picked up the car,that I had found out (by the cashier lady) that the mechanic was no longer with them.Chrysler would not help in any way,because I did not buy the extened warranty.I explained I would have if I was told that their vehicles do not go over 100,000 miles without needing an engine.they said we were way out of the 36,000 mile warranty,and they could do nothing.(vehicle is maintained and has 88,000 miles on it,mainly highway-due to my job-bought a jeep because they run forever! YEAH RIGHT!)Have owned nothing but daimler/chrysler vehichles-but through this experiene,all the lying and feeling of being taken advantage of,I am done with, them if they go out of business from too many lawsuits they deserve it with the way they treat their customers!I would have loved to pursue this legally-but was already at a $5,100.00 loss!",

"After having the heated seat element replaced due to Jeep recall, I now have a hot seat!!! Way too hot to sit on even in the low position and even after turning it off. I have asked to have it tested three different times: Told to: Sit differently on the seat, turn it off or don't use it, put a blanket on the seat. None of these solutions solve the problem that it is just too hot in one location on the right side of the seat and slightly warm on the left side of the seat. Service manager does not return my phone calls.",
"I purchased my 2006 Jeep Liberty, May 2006, it has approximately 21,000 miles and is still under the original manufacturers warranty.  My Jeep Liberty broke down, 1/6/08, it has been in the shop since 1/9/08.  The dealership has been working to try to find the problem; at first they thought it was the harness belt, however,that did not resolve the issue.  I received a call today, 1/23/08, there are severe technical issues with my vehicle.  The dealership has the Chrysler Engineering Department involved.  I had to rent a vehicle and pay for those expenses out of pocket.  I had contacted Chrysler via email; reference number 17137777 EMAIL CASE NUMBER: 1926156  I received a response back from Karrie, Customer Service Representative Chrysler Customer Assistance Center, the following was her response:  Thank you for contacting the Chrysler Customer Assistance Center  regarding the current issue with your 2006 Jeep Liberty.   I have called Swope Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and spoke with Phil the  service manager.  I was advised that they have found a failure code and are currently  trying to work with their technical team to resolve the issue.   We suggest you continue to work with the dealership in regards to this  issue.  Thanks again for your email. Sincerely.  I am disappointed as well as frustrated at the lack of concern and unwillingness to accept any responsibility in reference to the defect of manufacturing by Chrysler Corporation.      
      I am still without a car, two weeks later and the dealership is unsure if they will be able to resolve this technical issue with Chrysler.  The dealership is losing money, they have 2 mechanics assigned to this job, which would usually require one.  At this point, I would like to receive the amount my vehicle is worth according to the blue book and look at purchasing another vehicle, which would not be a Chrysler product.  I have the extended warranty on this vehicle as well, however, that does me no good if the vehicle is inoperable.",
In March of 2006 I took ownership of a 2006 Jeep Liberty in which I paid almost sticker price for.  Since the purchase of this vehicle I have had a continuing leak that has not only cause interior damage it is now cause electrical issues.  The dealership keeps telling me that they will not consider this vehicle a lemon as they have not been able to find the source or opening of this leak.  I followed the lemon law to a T and spoke with many mechanics.  The dealership has my car for about a week every third month and keeps telling me that they can not duplicate the leak therefore do not believe it is a lemon.  I over the last year and a half have had the vehicle repaired over 7 times and that is not including 2 FINAL REPAIR attempts by the dealer.  I am in no financial position to hire a lawyer and feel as if the dealer should own up to this car as it's their product and do something to assist me as I have been nothing but patient with them and have followed all of their instructions.,
"Purchased a new 06 jeep liberty, thinking this would be a reliable vehicle. What a joke!!! In the shop 7-8 times already. 2x for engine light on,had to tear the engine down both times, supposedly same thing each time only on different side each time. Ball joints replaced 1x, heater malfunction 3x, rotor malfunction 1x, cv boot replaced ( so far 1x ). Then just yesterday I had a front end collision with another vehicle. This one a chevy blazer, with damage to the doors.My Whole front end destroyed, only front view was radiator, 2 headlights,and a severely damaged hood. Bumper was completely destroyed and still no air bag deployment. I can't wait to get rid of this disaster on wheels.  I tell everyone I meet about this vehicle and warn them about my experiences. They should never be allowed to make another jeep or chrysler. My sister had similar experience with a sebring, What a piece of junk that thing was.",
"I purchased 2007 jeep commander 1 month ago and this vehicle has been in the shop more than I have been able to drive it. While driving the vehicle will start to jerk as though it had a bad miss. It has been to the dealership several times and once when the area service rep.was there and they tell me that the vehicle is suppose to drive this way.I had no problems with vehicle the first week driving it but since then while driving it is always in a jerking mode whether I am driving on a flat surface or on an incline. Why would anyone purchase a vehicle that drove this way is beyond me..I purchased a jeep vehicle thinking I could enjoy the ride. What a waste of $50,000.Does anyone have any idea what we all could do with this lousy chrysler product..Chrysler doesn't seem to want to help anyone..It's hard to imagine that this many people would have to keep vehicles that do not deliver what you purchase and get nothing resolved. My service dept. told us that this is how it will have to be..(not for long).we are getting advice from our attorneys and see how the LEMON LAW really works.

"Comments: I am frustrated and disappointed about my 2004 Jeep Liberty and the Maintenance Services (and recall repairs) performed/not performed on that Jeep. I bought the Jeep Liberty when it was brand new on my 48th birthday because I heard they (Jeeps) were dependable, durable, and fun to drive--I am disappointed because my jeep has not performed as promised. I am frustrated because there are more than eight recalls on Jeep Liberties including ball joint, exterior lights, power steering, door latch, etc.--I have experienced all those problems with my Jeep plus others. I purchased my Jeep from John Elway Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep in Englewood, Colorado--now known as GO Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge. I have taken my Jeep to the same dealership where I purchased it because they offered deals on service work. However, there is a pattern at the dealership of not having the parts to make the recall repairs most of the time when I take my Jeep in for oil changes, lube, filter replacement, etc. On three or more occasions, the dealership service department insisted that it did not have the parts to make repairs (while my car was under warranty). However, when the service department finally received the parts needed to make the repairs, I was told that I would have to pay for those parts and their installation because my car warranty had expired (my car warranty probably expired in September or October, 2007). Not only did the dealership charge/attempt to charge me for some of the warranty/recall repairs, it failed to perform the maintenance work on my last scheduled visit for the oil change, etc.. that I paid for. When I took my Jeep Liberty back to the dealership service department to get the work completed that I paid for, I also noticed that an exterior light was not functioning--a recall item. The service department pretended to be remorseful about not doing the automotive work that I had previously paid for, and promised to complete it and replace the exterior light for free--I had to pay for the bulb. However, when I picked up my Jeep, I was told by the service department that it could not repair the light because the housing that held the bulb in place had become so hot that it melted the bracket that held it in place. To me, the bracket looked as though it had been chipped on the inside. The service department told me that it would cost me about $300.00 to replace and install a new exterior lens/light. The outside of the lens/exterior light/housing is not cracked but looks new. While discussing the recall on the exterior light with the service department, I was told once again, that my Jeep was out of warranty to do the work. It is bad enought that the blue book value suggests that my 2004 Jeep liberty is worth under $7,000 (It was listed at $18,000.00+ when I purchased it in 2004), now it has electrical problems, exterior light problems, power steering problems, and my clutch seems to be malfunctioning.",
My almost brand new Jeep Patriot that I bought from them has been stalling at idle. I took it in and they said it was a programming problem. I don't see how this could fix the problem when I have read many other people have had problems even after their jeeps have been reprogrammed...I am worried that I bought a money suck and am not looking forward to the future with this car if it is already stalling after 9 months....,
"I bought a brand new jeep commander from Shaver jeep in San Bernardino. It had a some dings , sooome scratches and sooooome nicks . I was told after i purchased the vehicle they would repair the problems and they put it in writing . Well after a couple of weeks with no calls from the dealership ,I called to make an appointment with the service department . They took my car two days later called me and said they could not make repairs until i brought them the survey back for them to fill out . Yes a blank survey . This had nothing to do with are agreement ,but they will not fix my car untill they get a survey so they can fill out the survey and send it back to Daimler Chrysler...",
"I Purchased a 2006 Jeep Commander in Dallas Texas.The second day i have the vehicle the engine stalls unexpectedly.I dind't pay attention to it and keep driving it for a couple of months, engine stalls once in a while. I went home to New Orleans and one day i was at the red light and the 2006 Jeep Commander stop suddenly. The next day i brought it to the dealership and it stay there for about a week. The Dealership told me that, there's nothing wrong with. I took the jeep back and bought some spark plug. When i removed the spark plug, one of them has oil on it. I changed the spark plug but it doesn't help! the 2006 Jeep Commander engine still stalls unexpectively. I just recently brought it back to the dealership it has been there for three days now. I am now waiting for the dealership to contact me for the results. >I just want a safe and a reliable vehicle.",
"Brake rotors need turning after 15,000 miles the first time, after 9,000 the second time. Jeep dealer stated it was driver related e.g. riding the brakes, towing trailers etc. so they would not warranty them. Not the case. What the hell...",
"Safety Recall F25 - Jeep Grand Cheroke *Fan blades of the electric radiator fan may fracture & separate.  We took our Jeep into an independent and had the motor w/attached fan blades replaced before the recall. The mechanic told us that the fan blades & motor were bad & the blades could break. When the recall came out, we sent a copy of our original repair to Daimler Chrysler for reimbursement. First, they told us to take to a regular Chrysler Dealership and have them check it out to make sure the work was done correctly, We did that and all was fine (as so noted on my receipt from the dealership). Next they told us that they would not reimburse the money because the blades had not cracked, separated or broke prior to having it repaired. We asked them how many customers took their vehicles in for the recall repair & didn't have broken blades. They didn't want to hear that.  They refuse to let me speak to a manager and say we're sorry but there is nothing we can do, unless the blades cracked or broke prior to repair (Go figure--that is why they did the recall -- to fix the problem before they break and cause more damage!!!!!)",
"Several Incidents:  1) I took my Jeep in for a hard start situation and some other minor repairs. They told me I needed a new fuel pump for the hard start.  They had the car for 3 days.  I picked up the vehicle, took it home and the car still had a very hard start.  Took it back and the problem ended up being a bad fuel injector, which they charged me additional for.  Whole experience cost me $1800, and I got a new fuel pump I did not need.  Now, I took the vehicle back to them, even though I guess I should have taken it somewhere else, and same situation. 2) I took the vehicle in on Monday 12/3 for the transmission geting stuck in third gear, causing a check engine light, and a very small leak.  A couple of drops on transmission, but nothing on garage floor.  They diagnosed it as having a leaking torque converter and bad pump.  Quoted $2300 for overhaul of transmission.  Got a quote from AAMCO for $1900.  The dealer agreed to match the cost.  Picked vehicle up yesterday evening 12/6.  Cost $2242.17.  Higher than estimate.  Some additional work okayed, some misc expenses seem wrong.  Anyhow, needed car, paid bill.  Drove a few miles home and parked vehicle.  While driving to work this morning car gets stuck in third gear and check engine light comes on.  I am taking vehicle back this afternoon, they obviously misdiagnosed it again and now I am out $2242 for a transmission overhaul I never needed.  3)Bought a 2005 Pacifica from the same dealer.  Car is using 2-3 quarts of oil between oil changes.  Dealer lied to wife and said Chrysler design there engines to consume oil for some rediculous reason I can't recall.  Said there was nothing to fix.",
"Replaced brakes 3 times, wheel bearings, coolant fan relay. This car only has 70K on it!",
"My 2006 Jeep Commander started stalling at low speeds in April of this year with only 19000 miles on it. It has stalled about 12-15 times since then. Its been in the dealership service about 6 times and the dealership has been unable to duplicate and it never produces codes for a technician to diagnose. On one occasion while it was at Bales Jeep dealership for the same problem it stalled while the service advisor was taking it for a test drive, but nothing was fixed since no codes were thrown. My jeep has stalled near busy intersections, near railroad tracks, and while entering 55 mph traffic lanes. This is a dangerous vehicle to drive and neither the Jeep dealership nor DaimerChrysler seems to have a fix for the problem.",
"I bought a brand new 2007 Jeep Commander car IN June 2007 and it has stalled out and dropped an axel. When the axel fell off it was towed into the dealer. When driving on the highway it stalled and completely died. The last incident the car would not accelerate above 30 mph and when the accelerator was pushed to the floor the car drove at 30 mph. Is there a lemon law in MA and how do I apply for this? My son is 16, on his driver's permit and this is also extremely dangerous for an inexperienced new driver. This is the only vehicle that my family owns.",
"I took my 2007 Jeep in for repairs, because my front axle sounded like it was falling apart when I made hard turns. The dealership mechanic saied this was normal. The Customer Relations person wasn't very helpful in trying to resolve my problem as well.",
"I just had to replace the motor in my 2002 Jeep Liberty.  This car has been my favorite car ever up until this point.  I lost oil pressure in the middle of nowhere, and finally got a tow back to my home town.  I live in a very small town (pop. 3240 aprox.) and the mechanic we took it to said he has had to replace several Jeep Liberty motors as the oil pick up screen tends to clog.  I felt totally to blame since I have not been the best about oil changes, until I spoke with my brother who lives in Medford, OR and is a wonderful mechanic.  He is of the strong opinion that this is a manufacture problem and small pieces of gasket or something from manufacture fouled the screen.  He tells me that during routine oil changes you would not remove the oil pan and clean that screen.  Makes total sense to me.  Therefore I feel that this should be reported as a Jeep problem.",
"I hit a deer going 45 miles per hr in a 50 mile an hour speed zone. The deer hit the front center of my Jeep and the airbag did not deploy. It smashed my entire front. Radiator, fan, belst and powersteering from what we can tell for now.",
"August 2006 I purchased a brand new Jeep Liberty.  Less than 2 months later my steering wheel fell off while I was driving.  (thats right fell off; completely detached from the column).  Luckily for me, I was just gaining speed (~25ph) after being stopped at a red light when it happened.  (however less than one mile prior I was driving on the highway going 65mph.) Afterward, everything happened so fast.  I do know I was driving diaganaly down the road; when I applied my breaks, the ABS went off but I wasn't stopping; I ended up crashing into a snowbank.   My questions 1)Nobody from DiamlerChrysler contacted me re: this error.  When I finally contacted them, I was told what more do you what, we fixed it didn't we?   Doesn't DiamlerChrysler have the responsibility to make sure their cars are in safe, working conditions before they are sold?  This was a major mistake on DiamlerChrysler's part. I don't believe it should be swept under the rug and brushed off as if nothing happened. At the very least, the public should be aware of this life threatening error.",
"I bought a brand new Jeep Liberty in Jan of 2003.  My Jeep is now 4 years and 8 months old.  I make the last payment next month and warranty has just expired.  I was making a 3 hour trip to my sisters and almost made it to her house.  Right when I got off the highway, it started acting funny and started shutting off.  Luckily I was in one of those car dealer areas where there were dealerships all around me.  I saw the Jeep sign and managed to make it into the parking lot with basically no steering.  Turns out the car dropped a valve to no fault of my own and I need a whole new engine at $6000.00.  I could not believe that my first brand new car only lasted me 4 years and 8 months---and a Jeep of all things.  
      The Jeep dealership said my Jeep was in great condition otherwise and they have no idea why that happened to the engine.",
"On three random occasions during the month of October, I experienced power loss while driving my 2006 Jeep Commander, 4x4 Hemi.   The first time this occurred, I had taken a trip to the grocery store -- I turned the ignition to start the Jeep and it didn't kick over right away, all the warning lights lit up simultaneously, then randomly and at varying lengths of time went out. I thought oh, no my battery's going! but realized that some of the dash lights and the radio were turning on and off. So, I turned the ignition off and waited about 2 minutes, then I started the Jeep again. It started and everything seemed OK (except the airbag light remained on) so I decided to drive home. 
      As I was pulling out of the parking lot onto the main road, the dashboard lit up again, flashing on and off as before, and then a clunk-jerk -- no power steering, no power brakes, lights still going crazy. Luckily I was going quite slow and there wasn't much traffic, so I was able to coast into a parking lot on the other side of the road and stop in a parking spot, where I turned off the ignition. This time, I waited 5 minutes, it started and I made it home without incident (airbag light still lingered for a while). While this experience was a bit unnerving, I'd hoped it was a computer hiccup that wouldn't occur again.  Sadly, I was wrong, about two and a half weeks later, as I was leaving my house (so I was going slow) the dashboard started the same flashing routine as before. I shut the Jeep off immediately, waited about 2 minutes and re-started. No further problems but the airbag light lingered a few minutes as before.  The third incident was the day I brought it in for service (October 29th). I was driving along the main road about 40 mhp on a straight smooth section when all the warning lights began flashing on/off (oh, no!). Only a third mile from my home, at the first opportunity I turned off the main road and kept driving slowly to my garage. I made it there without losing the steering/brakes, lights flashing the whole way.   I no longer feel safe driving this vehicle. The whole idea of possibly losing my power steering/brakes while driving fast is very dangerous and puts my family and others on the road in harms way.  The vehicle was purchased from Desert Jeep in Las Vegas. It has been there 3 times for service (list of inconveniences) and the service has been lousy at best. This being an important safety issue, I decided to take it to a family run dealership - Jim Marsh Jeep. The service staff were much more helpful and genuinely seem to care - nevertheless unable to resolve my problem. These incidents did not leave a code in the computer and they are unable to re-create the problem, so they don't know what to fix. They called the manufacturer, who took two days to return the call, only to suggest that I remove the other three keys from my keyring because their weight must be causing the highly-sensitive ignition tumbler to toggle to accessory mode.  Uuuuugggghhhhhh. I am not comfortable with this explanation. I am still afraid to drive this vehicle. What should I do?",
"I bought my Jeep Liberty Limited edition 2002, brand new from a Jeep dealer. Other than the gas consumption, I have liked the vehicle till now. Last week, I noticed my check engine light was on, and took it to the dealer. I was told that the engine was dead, yup in a 2002 vehicle! I have never heard of such a thing! I have no choice but get it fixed at the $3500 price tag. At the moment I am driving my spare car, a 1992 Nissan sentra that has 190,000 miles!",
"I cant believe people can get away with this!  2005 Jeep Larado, two years old, 37,000 miles and parts start falling off!  A hydro-electrical connector? with accompanying seal for the transmission decided that 37,000 miles was just too much for it to take.  The Jeep dealership said that our warranty was only good for 36,000 miles.  Riddle me this, Jeep, how many of your transmission plugs and seals fail shortly after the warranty expires?  The dealership informed me that the hydro-electrical connector would cost $179 and the seal would be another $199.  $378 not including labor!  What a joke.  24,000 for a 2005 Jeep Lerado, $378 for a plug and seal (1,000 miles over warranty), knowing that things are just going to get worse, priceless.",
Purchased a new Jeep Liberty back in '05 and the seats look HORRIBLE! Didn't realize this was such a problem until I did a little research on the internet. This is an issue Jeep needs to address. My jeep is in excellent condition except for the upholstery. Good thing I'm not looking to sell it. Has anyone gotten any help with this issue?,
"My husband and I bought a new 2006 Jeep Commander from Barton's Jeep on 12/15/2005. Bought the car right off the show room floor. At around 9,000 miles my Jeep started to stall on me. My Jeep does this at all miles per hour. It has happen at 65 miles per hour and as low as 15 miles per hour. When it does this the car has to be stopped and placed in park to restart. So in order to do this I have no power steering at all and have to get my auto to the side of the road. Very difficult when you are driving 65 miles per hour down the freeway. Looking at the car behind you wondering if you are going to die. I have taken my car to the dealer 35+ times with no results in fixing it. I seem to be driving a rental car at least 65% of the time right now. Something really needs to be done about this before someone is really seriously hurt.",
My 2006 Jeep commander continues to stall in traffic. I read that there are several people who own the same type suv with the same problem.,
"The panel lights in our Jeep Commander along with the exterior lights and headlights flicker on and off until it just turnns off completely while I am driving with my 2 young kids. 
      The first night it happened, I was on a highway with my kids when the car just went black. I had to play with the lights for it to turn back on just to have it happen again. I called Jeep service in Morristown the next morning but they could not get me in until next week. I had to pick up my kids again the next night and it happened again. Thank God we did not get into an accident. I called Jeep service again and they offered for me to drop off my car and get a loaner car. Great idea. I remember the sales person whom we purchased the car from tell us that a loaner car would be included in our agreement. But when speaking with the service department, he told me that I had to pay for the loaner car. So, I contacted Scott Snow, Head of Sales st Warnock Jeep and I explained the above to him. Scott Snow's response was Oh well, that's too bad.Even if my salesperson told you that the loaner was included, it is not true. You still have to pay for the loaner. Didn't you read the fine prints?  What kind of response is this? We have been customers of Jeep Warnock for over a decade and no issue. We have been quite satisfied. We have given them hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales and Scott Snow is turning me away for $30.00??? It does not make sense to me. We were told that the loaner would be in our agreement and we want this in effect.",
"4.7 V8 2007 commander purchased in May. Test drive- all dash lights went out. Took back to dealer and reported this. When I returned a few days later the same vehicle was on the lot and I was told that it simply got put on the lot without some sort of valves being engaged upon arrival to the dealership and that was what caused the initial problem, it was corrected and the vehicle was fine (this is what I was told) Stupidly I purchased the Jeep. Within a few days I started the vehicle to leave for work, put into drive and could not go faster than 5-8 MPH. 
      I stopped, put back in park, back in drive and was fine. This happened several more times and I called the dealership and was told that I needed to turn the key on and wait for all dash lights to cycle before actually starting the vehicle. Tired that, doesn't matter. Same thing happens, just never know when it will happen. I have pulled out into traffic from work place on several occasions only to be bogged down and not able to accelerate. Then all the light went out again and the electronic module was replaced and system flashed again. Still have same problem. I have been back to the dealership five times now. On the fourth trip with same issue and not being able to duplicate I left the dealership only to have the event happen again and I got a service employee in the vehicle with me and he witnessed it. I was asked to bring my vehicle back the following week (this week) and that a service person would drive the jeep home and to work for a few days to see if it happened with them. Guess what???? My jeep sat in the same spot undriven for three days. I went inside and was told, sorry we couldn't duplicate the event. I had written down the mileage and it showed 1 more mile on it than when I left it. I am sure it just turned over when they pulled the vehicle to the back of the building where it sat until I picked it up. I am ready to try for Lemon Law now. I am so frustrated with this problem. Most times when it happens I can put it in park then back in drive, but have occasionally had to turn the ignition off then on again. It feels to me like the transmission is stuck. I just don't know and don't know what to do at this point!",
We have had several problems with our Jeep Liberty Diesel.  The ERV valves has been replaced three times. The engine shuts down or just rattles and shakes and won't accelerate.  The dealer is just reading code and replacing parts until it is out of warranty.  We are not alone.  If you Google Jeep Liberty CRD Problems you will have plenty to read.,
2006 Jeep Commander. Repeated stalling in idle situation as well as moving during driving.,
George Arlington TN  (10/07/07)bought new 2006 jeep liberty.  i have taken the vehicle in three times to repair faulty power windows.,
"I own 3 jeep commanders, one of which my wife drives daily. from the beginning, she complained about the acceleration of this car, it slows down when attempting to accelerate going up even a very small incline or merging onto traffic. I complained to the company very shortly after I made this purchase and your response was that there was nothing wrong with this car. also her brakes lose it tightness when braking and they screech and this car has less than 24,000 miles, the next issue is that the front passenger seatbelt light comes on when it wants to and if she lays any object in that seat the light comes on. my fear is that the airbag is going to come out even when no-one is sitting there and an accident occurs. this is so ridiculous to have such a nice looking car that just may be a death trap.",
"the drivers side power window made a loud popping sound and fell down into the doorwell.  There are too many identical instances of this happening, and action should be taken against the makers of Jeep.",
Front Driver's side power window regulator plastic part snapped.  This is a well known defect which leaves the window open and inoperative. Jeep then charges $289 for a part that is available for under $100 aftermarket.,
"Purchased an 04 Liberty...Prior to the sale, Graham said everything a customer wanted to hear, i.e. We will be there for you if you have any problems ,etc. The following day after taking delivery of the car, I noticed missing parts from the vehicle. I called about it...No answer. The next day,after only driving thc car 50 miles, the check engine light went on. Took the Car to my local Jeep dealer. Cost me $600 to fix.",
Jeep Commander stalles while driving.  Has happened 14 times and dealer has attempted to fix 5 times with no success.,
"I have the 2006 Jeep commander, which was purchased in December 23, 2006.  I have only it had it for 9 months.  The first problem is that I cannot use my third row, because due to the headrest I am unable to see safely out of rear view mirror.  This is very disappointing considering that this was a major feature that drew me to purchase the vehicle.  Most recently, tow months ago my car began to stall for no reason.  I have had all of my routine maintenance done the car is less than a year old, there should be no problem.  It has stalled on me while I was driving, luckily I was in my neighborhood with very little traffic and going at a low speed.  It stalled when I attempted to start it up on two occasions as well. Sometimes when I slow down it sounds as if its going to stall, but doesn't. I expressed my concern to the dealership and they tried to tell me it was the type of gas that I was using.  I frequent the same gas station for the past 5 years and have never had this problem with any of my vehicles. The dealership has been no help. I have pretty much made there sale and now the vehicle is my problem.",
"I've owned my 2006 Jeep Commander since September of 2006. I've had nothing but issues with it. The first time I took it to the dealership was due to the ac/heat and fan unit was malfunctioning. Turn on the fan with ac on and hot air blew out. The same results with heat being on. The mechanic at the dealership had to replace the whole ac/heat/fan unit. Two months later it still has issues with turning the fan off with the ac on. Not long after that a much more serious issue arose. Sporadically when I let off the accelerator and tap the brakes to slow at a stoplight the Jeep looses all power and the steering wheel of course locks up. I have to slam on the brakes, shove the Jeep into park and then crank the jeep back up and put it back in drive in time to not get rear ended. The Jeep also turns off at stop signs, on inclines at low speeds and also when accelerating from any kind of stopped point. The Jeep is unsafe for my family to drive and I am afraid my family will eventually be hurt in this Jeep. I now have my Jeep in the shop going on day 2 and the mechanic at the dealer still can't find anything wrong. Computer board sends no errors during testing is all they say to me. The warranty runs out in 200 miles so after that I'll have to pay to have it looked at. I'd like to trade it in to save my family but that will be endangering another family.",
"We bought our 07 Jeep Commander brand new March 2007.  We have had it for about 6 months.  In the short amount of time that we have owned this vehicle it has been in the service department to be fixed for 5 things.  
      The first time the jeep had about 2800 miles on it and the home link system and compass stopped working.  They had to replace what they called the computer module.  Then just 4 days after getting it back we had to take it in again.  The car stalled and all my lights came on and it wouldn't even shift out of first gear.  They said they had to replace the ignition switch. It worked for about 3 months and then did the same thing in August and had to go back.  They again replaced the ignition switch.  I am a little scared to drive it because I have no clue if it will do it again.  I have read online where others have had the same problem and they keep having to get it fixed only to have it do the very same thing over and over again.  Now they are going to have to replace both of my fog lamps because they are cracked.  Also my power locks have stopped working and I have even got out of my car shut the door and the car locked without me doing anything.  That is scary because I have small children in my car and it could have locked them in.  SO they are fixing that also.  I am really getting tired of this car and all the problems in the short amount of time we have had it.  We would like to get a new car (not a Jeep).  Hopefully we can get this all resolved.  We didn't go out and pay $35000 for a brand new car that I have to take in to be fixed all the time and don't feel safe driving my family in.",

"I have 2003 Jeep Liberty. So far I've had to replace the back left window regulator twice and the back right regulator once. Thats three times in a span of about a year at $300 buck a pop. From what I'm reading on line this his happening to a lot of people. There really shuld be some help from Chrysler because the dealer wont do anything for me. As it is, I'll never buy another chrysler Jeep again because of this alone.",1.0
"I have leased a 2006 Jeep Commander and have had nothing but issues with it. At first it was my windows, they would go up and down as they wish. Then the door locks, they would open and close as they wish. Then the sunroof, that also would stay open and would close when it would see fit. What was the last straw, I was driving on the highway doing a good 50 and the car completely shuts off!!! I was terrified!!! I towed my vehicle to the nearest Jeep dealership and was told that I would need a new computer? So here I am hoping it can be that simple but it's not. The mechanic puts in said computer and the car is not even turning on. This is crazy!!! I work to hard to pay for a vehicle that is manufactured incorrectly.",
"My 2003 Jeep Liberty has had the rear calibers seize at 25,000 miles and now again at 63,000 miles. Chrysler states this is standard wear and tear of a vehicle. I DISAGREE! Yes calibers need to be replaced, but calibers should NOT seize up totally, especially at this mileage. The first time this occurred the vehicle was still under warranty, but Chrysler is not willing to help out this time around. It's truly a shame to have an unexpected $600 repair bill to a vehicle that you're still making payments on. Also truly a shame that Chrysler has lost the sale of any new vehicles that are in my future.   I did ask Chysler if this was a problem reported by any other Liberty owners, but of course they denied such. Somehow I very much doubt it!",
"We bought a Jeep Compass because it was supposed to get 23 city and 26 highway (in the fine print on the sticker it states: 19-27 mpg city driving and 22-30 mpg highway driving with the options on our vehicle)for $27,000. Two days after we bought it we returned to the dealer complaining that it was only getting 17 -19 mpg and wanting to turn it back in. We bought the car hoping to save money on gas...it certainly wasn't for the size! We had a Ford Explorer before - much bigger and got THAT milage! We were told it just needed some time to get broken in. We made several more trips to the dealer to have the computer reflashed supposedly to improve the milage. After all of these trips to the dealers it still only averages 18 -19 mpg by keeping track of the milage and gallons used. This, by the way does not correlate to what the indicator on the dashboard states you are getting for milage.....and we do almost completely highway driving. Finally we did a cold call on the dealership and caught the manager. We had made several phone calls regarding this problem but no one returned our calls 99% of the time. Finally at this point we had 10,000 miles on the vehicle. The deal they offered us was $19,000 for trade in on a vehicle that was 2 months old and now had 10,000 miles on it, BECAUSE THEY KEPT TELLING US THAT TIME AND REFLASHING THE COMPUTER WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM....WHICH IT DID NOT. Therefore, it cost us not only the gas to fill it, but $800/mile in car cost. Tony says he talked to Chrysler and they will do nothing for us.",

"In august of 2006 I was driving up a hill on a major road in the Adirondacks.  At the top of the hill, my car went from drive to reverse causing me to stop suddenly in the middle of the highway.  I thought my dog had pushed the shifter and even if he did, the shift shouldn't have gone into reverse while I was driving since you need to be at a complete stop, foot on the break and need to push in the shift button in order to put the car into reverse.  I suffered whiplash and severe lower back pain that I'm still being treated for one year later.  I was informed by Chrysler that shift buttons are a maintenance item and therefore they are not responsible for my accident.",

"Twice since March my 2007 Jeep Liberty has experienced unintended acceleration.  This Jeep is only 3 months old.
      The first time the Jeep accelerated on its own I was pulling into my own garage and it accelerated into the wall, pushing the filing cabinet in the garage through the wall. We had to have the sheet rock replaced, but have not bought the hardiplank to replace and repair the outside of the house.  Today the Jeep accelerated over a hill on a windy wet back road, but THANK GOD there was no one else on the road at the time and no damage done. Is this a common problem with these new vehicles?

"My 2006 Jeep Commander is stalling while driving.  It was purchased in December 2006 and approximatley four months later stalled while driving down the highway at 65 MPH.  We are lucky to be alive.  The car continued to stall the whole way to the dealership.  The dealership was very cooperatve and advised that it was a wiring problem and that it had been fixed.  Today while traveling on Interstate 95 with my two year old daughter I was in the high speed lane going approx. 75 miles per hour (with cruise control on) and the car died.  We were again very lucky to make it to the breakdown lane without being hit or killed.  The car is again in the shop, although not my local dealer as I was traveling home from New Hampshire and went to the closet dealer.  I have asked my local dealer to consider taking the car back and putting me in something else as this is a lease.  I am not going to ever trust this vehicle again with my daughter's life.

I have had nothing but good luckwith my jeeps in the past, however Chrysler could not care less about my very deadly problem. The ironic part is that I sold jeeps for 6 yrs. That made it all the more ironic when the nice lady on the phone toldme there was nothing wrong with the car, that it was me. Maybe if I log another 1/4 of a million miles or so in Jeeps I'l be able to figure out how the brakes work.",
"This is the first time owning a jeep product and we are very disappointed. Both of the front windows fell and broke out of the blue! Apparently the clip inside the window broke, and instead of replacing an inexpensive part we had to buy the entire motor for both windows, resulting in over $600.00.  Speaking with the machanics at the jeep dealership and the local garages, this is a very common problem for Jeep. Tens of thousands if not more customers have experienced this problem. My garage told us they keep jeep window mototors in stock because it is such a current problem. There is a faulty peice in the window and they refuse to recall or do anything about it. I am waiting for the rear windows to fall next! Please help.",
"my 2007 jeep shuts off while in transit, has happened 3x's within aprox 2-2 1/2 months apart, everytime it malfunctions I take it to the service Dept and they cannot find the problem. The first time, it was while on the freeway going about 70mph all power shut down for about 5 seconds, and restarted on its own. 2nd time I was traveling 10-15 mph it completely shut down, this time, I had to put it in park and restart it. 3rd time, I was aproaching a red light, and it completely shut down, I put it in park, and restarted it. I am afraid an accident will occur while in this state.  
      I drive quite a bit on the freeway and fear it will occur & get hit by a fast traveling vehicle.I am not getting any resolutions from the service dept. and I dont believe they fully comprehend the hazard of this malfunction.  The service installed an auto pilot to record any malfunctions that occur, the other problem is that they only left it in my jeep for 1 1/2 weeks, not allowing enough length of time aprox 2 months- as record shows its reocurred- therefore nothing was recorded. I was told by the service dept that because they cannot diagnose this problem, there is nothing that they can do at this time, I am supposed to keep driving this lemon until it happens again, and at that time, they will still not have a diagnosis- It is a continuous cycle, without any resolution. I need Help!",

"I have a 2003 Jeep Laredo.  Recently the RPMs revup, the gas gauge flutters, and then the car dies.  It does start back up, but then stall out after a mile or so.  Been to three car dealer repair shops.  After 2 week, they still can't figure it out.  They replaced the speed sensors, checked the fuel filter, fuel pump, throttle body and idle control motor, ECU, wiring harness to ECM, fuel pressure gauge, air control valve.  Nothing can be found to cause the problems.  What can I do now? Is there a recall on this vehicle because of these problems?",
"In February 2006, my front passenger window fell on its own and would not stay up.  It turned out to be the regultor and cost $260.00 to have replaced.  In May of 2006, the driver's side window did the same thing.  A friend was able to replace it, but the part itself was $250.00.  Most recently, in May 2007, the left rear window regulator has now gone out.  The Jeep dealer quoted me a price of $312.00 for the part.  As a result, I have been driving around for two weeks now with a piece of cardboard holding up the window.  I am a teacher and it is difficult for me to get the car somewhere to get it repaired since I have to be at work so early. Unfortunately the Jeep is past the warranty.    I contacted Jeep by e-mail, explained the situation, and was told they would not consider any reimbursement since the car is past its warranty.    I have seen online that others have the same problem and feel this has to be a defect in the part.",

I have been a Jeep owner for the last 22 years and if this cannot be resolved I will more than likley never by another Jeep.

"On April 14, 2007 I brought my 2007 Jeep Compass to Manhattan Jeep Dodge Chrysler in New York City for a 6k mile oil change.   The total charged for this service was $135 before labor expenses were dropped after I complained of the high charge.  The invoice which I regretfully paid was $85.72 which is still outrageous for a simple oil change.   
      The service advisor indicated the high charge was due to the use of special oil and labor.  When I informed the advisor that Jeep dealerships in Brooklyn, New York specifically Kings Plaza Jeep only charges $39.95 for the same service, he insisted that these Jeep service centers were putting the wrong oil in the car; this was an absurd response.  My annoyance with this situation compelled the service director to look into the charges while giving me a $40 credit toward my next service visit.  He also mentioned to fax him any documentation that would prove my argument and he would refund the difference.   On April 16 I faxed the service director a copy of the oil change receipt from Kings Plaza Jeep.  The fax clearly shows a $39.95 charge for the same service and oil as performed and used by Manhattan Jeep.  The fax also showed what Bay Ridge and Garden City Jeep both charge for a 2007 Jeep Compass oil change; both under $40 using the same oil. In addition the service director was provided a copy of a $29.99 oil change promotion certificate, which I received from Manhattan Jeep after purchasing my vehicle from them several months earlier (I didnâ€™t have the certificate with me at the time of the service).  Needless to say I never heard back from the service director so I called him a week after sending the fax.  Apparently annoyed I called him, he was abrupt and said he would credit my credit card $40.  As of today I have not received a credit or a returned phone call from the sales manager who I advised of this situation or the owner of the dealership who I left a message.       Do not do business with this dealership. Besides overcharging their customers for simple services their customer relationship skills are poor and they do not keep their word, which for me and Iâ€™m sure other consumers is more valuable than $40.",
"I have a 2004 hemi, I drove it through a puddle about 8-10 deep that was across the road. This is supposed to be a 4X4 'OFF ROAD' Vehicle? it's never even been off Road! If you look at the design of these trucks, you'll find a real brain buster, the air intake sits BELOW the motor, IN FRONT of the front tire. The result was water into the air intake from a little 8 puddle, hardly sounds like a rugged 'Off Road' truck!  OK, the Beauty is I had paid over $2000.00 for the 'Top of the Line' warranty, and they covered NOTHING! 
      I have brought it in for service before on a warranty related issue, all I ever get is an excuse why I have to pay. The insurance company paid them to put another motor in it, but when they did, they stole my other parts that they were supposed to re-install, like my Alternator, AC Pump, all the parts from the top of the motor were rusty and used, they put a junkyard motor in and instead of replacing my parts, the just left the junk stuff on the used motor and kept my 'Good' parts. The sales guy's thought the whole thing was pretty funny, as I was leaving one told me We got your Money again, have a great weekend sucker, the biggest problem with these guys in addition to just being crooks, is they are so cocky about it when you catch them and their rip-offs, they actually laugh about it, well, I suppose why not, after all they seem to get away with it. I'd adding here a picture of a postcard they sent me to try to get me to do business with them again, it features 'My Truck' (same make, etc.) driving through the ocean! It's just amazing how these crooks take advantage of people through deceptive advertising, if you did this you would blow the motor, trust me I did it.  I will be spreading the word, and I ask anyone who reads this to do so as well, and If you have had a bad experience with these dealers, let's get together and stand up for ourselves, it's as easy as spreading the word, make a post on the net, there is power in that, they're just too stupid to realize it will catch up to them sooner or later. They think you are 1 little person and as long as they get your money that's all they care about, and they WILL trick you to do it.",
"I live in Miami for school. I needed my transmission rebuilt and my jeep is still under warranty. They got the jeep on Friday and informed me that it would take a couple of days to fix the transmission. Four days (Sunday not included) later they told me that they had done the inspection (it apparently took four full days) and the parts would be in the following Friday.
      I had called that afternoon and was told it would be ready that evening by another woman in service. Even though they are open for service and parts Saturday, I was told that they would start fixing it Monday, now a week and a half since they got it.  I told them I was leaving Miami until August that same Friday and I was given a very shady response along the lines of Well, let me check with my technician and call you back, he might have the part already (the same technician she claimed to have just spoken to). I believe that they are pushing back work on my jeep because of the warranty ($100 deductible v. $2400).  This is the same dealership who only weeks before my regular warranty was up told me there was nothing wrong when I told them my jeep seemed unusually unstable.  Two months later in New Jersey I took it to a friend who found the sway bar badly broken. I have been trying all day to get an answer from this woman who claimed she would know by 11:00 am this morning, but had left for her lunch break an hour after I spoke with her rather than call me right back like she claimed she would. It is now 3:00 PM.",
Jeep Commander: Stalling - The only reason my engine stalled on a few occasion was because my knee hit the key and turned off the engine.,
"I purchased a Jeep Commander from Maroone on December 11 2006, I had the car less than a month and the engine stalled on me at least 4 times due to a severe over heating problem also I lost considerable fluid from the engine. As I was told by the service manager it was a hose and fitting, so they proceeded to repair the problem, it took over two weeks to get it done. Approximateley two months later I saw I was again over heating, so I checked the radiator and there was no fluid in the radiator, I put a gallon and a half of coolant in the radiator and it ran cool for another two months. Then again I saw I was overheating, so I contacted the dealership for an appointment and here we are again in the shop for the exact same thing. I was treated very very badly. I was told that they would not give me a loaner for the duration it will take to repair my vehicle until I had to contact the GM at the dealership. He made arrangements for a loaner. Please advise me on what action I can take to reamody this problem. I cannot pay over $30,000.00 for a vehicle that is not in factory condition. I paid good money for this vechicle and when I get it back it will have a rebuilt engine which if I want to sell or trade it in I will be peanolized for this problem. Agian Please advise me on what to do.",
"The car has recently accelerated violently on four occasions, without pressing the accelerator; the most recent was yesterday morning.  While backing the car slowly, it suddenly accelerated.  I pressed the brake pedal as hard as possible to stop.  Two wheels spun (4wd) and made black marks on the pavement.  Engine then slowed and acted normal. I looked down at my foot on the brake to be sure nothing was touching the accelerator.  
      The dealer says they have never heard of such a thing, and couldn't replicate it.  It is clearly dangerous to drive this vehicle.",

"We have owned our 2006 Jeep Commander for 9 months. In the 9 months that we have owned it, we have had 2 rock chips patched on the windshield, and now have 4 separate cracks spreading across the windshield that all originated from below the windshield wipers. 
      It seems that their is either a design flaw with the windshield (is it too boxy, square, and tall/big?) for all of these problems to be happening. We don't drive on gravel roads at all, and have never had rock chips and cracks in our windshield on any other vehicle we have owned except for this one. It seems that the cracks may be the result of stress on the windshield, or just a design flaw in particular. We have a friend that also owns a 2006 Jeep Commander, and they are currently on their 3 windshield after owning their vehicle for 11 months. We took it into the local Jeep dealership to have them take a look at it and tell us if they can repair it under warranty, and they pretty much told us they don't ever repair anything glass related under warranty, and continued to point out that each of the 6+ spots on the windshield (even below the wiper blades) were all rock chips and they couldn't do anything about that.  My biggest problem is, I do not want to pay close to $500 (what we received an estimate for) to have the windshield replaced only to have it happen again and again. I have heard that others have the same complaint about their windshields and am wondering how many others with this same problem have to complain before Jeep issues a recall on the Commanders because of the windshield (not to mention the major problem of the blind spot in the rear of the car.)  Other than the windshield and the blind spot in the rear, we love our Commander, but these two issues seem to be pretty major issues to us.",
"I traded for a Jeep Commander in Feb '06 and have since had to trade again because of the following:  1. Windows rattled after many attempts to fix. 2.  Headlites blind everyone when not on highbeam,so ppl constantly flash theyre highbeams.  3. blind spot because of seats.  4.  Ants got into the open trim and inside the car and were impossible to get out.
      Now in Jeep Cherokee I'm not much happier, Very upside down, I'm stuck for sometime.  The '06 Cherokee sounds like a 10 year old car, It lost so much headroom from the '04 model, a big person cant fit behind the wheel with their heads touching the roof.  Leaves get into the A/C and are very annoying.  Water gets all between the doors when its washed, and will mold it you don't towell dry.  Air comes in from the road.",
"I have a 2004 Jeep that I purchased new. In 4-29-05 they had to replace the rotors because of front brake problems. 9191 miles. In 4-6-2006 back brake problems rear brakes rotors had to be resurfaced at my cost. 17,704 miles. Wrote Chrysler and they refunded some of the money.  2-15-07 front brake problems again and need new rotors again. 
      Dealer would do nothing for me.  $272.50 cost. Called Chrysler and they call New SmyrnaChrysler to the service manager, Bob and he said I put 13,000 miles on the jeep since the last new rotors and it was time for new ones. There is a case action lawsuit going on concerning the front brake problems in jeeps and there was a recall on them after mine was fix the first time. The car was a little over a year old when they first went out. I told the girl I talked to I have never heard of repairing brakes that soon as I have only put brakes on one other car we had and we had it for ten years. Was really upset and told her we have owned 12 or more Chrysler products and they just lost a good customer and I would be buying G.M. from now on and more then likely shortly as I figure they are going to keep doing this. Of course they don't care. Checked around and people say there is no way this should have happened.I paid $272.50 for something that was a reocurring problem with a class action lawsuit and the car was still under a three year warranty",
"Although Jeep had issued a recall in Aug 2006on the lower ball joints of the vehicle, I did not receive my recall notice until the end of December 2006. I called the dealer and the part was apparently on back order. Its a shame the dealer did not have this part in a timely manner as on 1/30/2006 the wheel of my vehicle came off while I was driving!!! 
      The ball joint had broken which caused the wheel to come off completely. I was very lucky that I did not cause a serious accident!! It was a MAJOR inconvenience as I lost a day of work as well as had to pay for a tow truck to take me to the dealer to have it fixed. When I initially walked into the dealer, a representative had let me know that the part was still on recall. They were, however, able to fix the car, but I am still now out of pocket. I do not believe this recall notification is/was out to consumers in a timely fashion whatsoever and in such a safety hazard I do not think this part should be on back order at all. This is a MAJOR safety hazard that already has caused a number of accidents in the country,.",
Total engine failure in my 2005 Jeep liberty. The service manager says it is due to lack of maintenance. This is ridiculous. I have owned 8 Jeeps and I have never had any such problems.They are refusing to fix it under my Jeep warranty or my extended warranty that I purchased. I had no warning of any problems. The only thing that happened is that the transmission light came on.,
"My Jeep's freeze plug blew out 3 weeks ago. Then another blew out last week Each time it sprayed 200 degree antifreeze oil all over the Engine and the hood and compartment.  Every time I start the car,it smell like it is over heating.  I asked the dealer to clean the engine, he said Chrysler has to autorize it.  
      I call customer service. They told me it is a maintenance problem.  Since when do you maintain a Freeze plug it is a defect,and they fixed the plugs for free. they claim they don't know what is causing it. so now I have a car that smell and may break down at any time.  I asked them if it is a defect under warranty and they fixed it, since the defect cause the oil to spry it should be covered to clean up the car.  They said to bad, that is their policy.  I guess Ford Chevy or Toyota will be in our future purchase. that caused other damage",

"Michael Red Lion PA  (12/13/06)I purchased a 2005 Jeep Liberty Diesel from Chrysler Jeep in Red Lion, PA in 10/05.    Since my purchase, I have had nothing but problems with the engine.  The Jeep has been in and out of the dealership at least 12 times.  I can provide many of the service papers if needed.  PA has a lemon law, but only up to 12,000 miles.  Due to my work, I put on 12,000 miles within 3-4 months.  I called Chrysler to complain about the problems I've been having and the only solution they gave me was to purchase the extended warranty that would give me coverage for up to 100K miles.  The cost of the extended warranty is about $2,500.  I went ahead and purchased the extended warranty and am paying that in monthly installments.  I would like to pursue the Federal Lemon Law at this point.

"I was injured and my vehicle was damaged when my jeep went into reverse on its own while idling in park.  After the incident I became aware that a recall had been issued for this reason.  I was never informed of this recall by the manufacturer or the dealer where I purchased and have my vehicle repaired at.
      The jeep knocked me to the ground and dragged me while my hand was slammed in the door.  It ran over my leg resulting in injurying my knee.  My hand is cut and severly bruised from being slammed in the door and my body is covered in road rash from being dragged.  In addition, my jeep is wrecked so I have no transportation to work or school or doctor's appointments.",
"I have a 2004 JEEP Liberty. Still under warranty. I have had it to two dealers because there is a problem with the transmission not shifting properly. Both dealers told me there was nothing wrong with it. Then I had a local mechanic tell me that my lower ball joints were bad. He took me right under the car and showed me how they were loose. Took it to a dealer and was told there was nothing wrong with it...that it was within their factory specs. I now suspect this is also the case with the transmission...it is probably within their factory specs. Not sure why they bother having a warranty if they are not going to fix anything that is wrong...only things that are totally shot. I now find out that my JEEP is included in a recall for....surprise, surprise...bad ball joints!! Only problem is that I have to continue driving it until they get around to sending me a recall notice. I feel this is unsafe since bad ball joints can wear on your tires.
      No damage yet, but there is certainly potential for damage since I have to drive around with bad ball joints.",

"On 12/29/03 I purchased a 2004 Jeep Liberty SUV (1 month after a recall notice came out on 2003 libertys, which of course I never received).  During January 2004 my jeep spun around on the road (360 degrees) three times, all at slow speeds.  I ended up off road on all three occasions - once in a snow bank and the jeep felt like it was going to tip over on the drivers side, but I sat still and it remained standing.  I was able to back out of snow bank.  Once I went off in a ditch in front of a school bus full of kids.  The bus driver had to pull off raod to avoid collision.  
      Once, I was actually at a dead stop, waiting behind a turning vehicle.  The minute I barely touched the gas pedal, it immediately spun in a 360 degree circle.  I find it incredible that from a dead stop upon light acceleration, the jeep would not move forward even an eighth of an inch, but start to spin uncontrollably in 360degree circle.  Each time it was like the steering was not in my control, like it was doing it's own thing ...Three weeks after service appointment, April 5, 2004, I was traveling on Hwy 55 from Boise to Cascade, going speed limit of 65 mph.  My jeep uncontrollably veered off to rightside ditch, came back on road, then veered off again into ditch, where it catapulted off enbankment of driveway; sending my jeep 20 feet in air, where it hit a power pole head on, caught on fire, rolled in the air, rolled over fence, landed on ground, continued to roll and continued to burn.  An ex-volunteer firefighter was only person on road at the same time.  He was driving toward me and saw whole wreck unfold.  He called 911 and after 3 tries finally pulled me from the burning jeep.  Thirty seconds after he pulled me from jeep it exploded in flames.  I was Life Flighted to nearest trauma center in Boise, Idaho.  I have no recollection of any of this because of my brain injury and memory loss.  I'm reporting the facts that were reported on a local tv news show, on the front page of two local newspapers, and what the firefighter told me he saw and did.  He told me what didn't make sense to him was why the jeep went off the road the second time.  He said when the jeep came back on the road it looked like I was getting the vehicle back under control, and then all of a sudden it veered uncontrollably back into the ditch. He said the amazing thing was that the jeep never lost speed, even after it had gone into ditch twice, it still was coming at a a speed of 65 mph.  He said that didn't make sense.  The vehicle should have slowed down, once it ran off road.  Also the sherriff said they could tell I was not speeding, and he said there were no skid marks, because usually in an accident like this the driver slams on brakes, whether the smart thing to do or not, and even if I had slammed on brakes there were no skid marks left.  Basically it was like the steering was out of control and the brakes were not working.",

Now it is messing up. I am now in a situation where Jeep keeps saying they “do an update” and there’s nothing wrong. The transmission is hitting very hard and slipping. My first Jeep did this and made a loud noise driving down the road and I was told that was normal for the engine type. I am now out tons of money. I was also told they would take my first Jeep back in for what I paid since they had it more than I did in 2 months of having it. They shorted me thousands and now I’m upside down on my current loan with a very high payment on another Jeep with issues.",1.0
I have had my 2019 Jeep Cherokee to the dealer on numerous occasions regarding my navigation system. I was told at one point Jeep has trouble talking to Android. You’ve got to be kidding me. I’ve taken it to two different dealers and have yet to get a satisfactory answer or repair. One dealer did a reset 3 weeks ago. It worked temporarily but has since stopped. I’ve also had trouble with my Jeep beeping and shutting down while turning left. The excuse for this was low oil. Give me a break. I have regular oil changes so this seems to be yet another excuse. Now they want me to bring it in for an oil compression test.,1.0
Currently have a 2021 Jeep Cherokee Sport. Last winter and this winter leaves me stranded with a dead battery after leaving it plugged in for 3 days at -40 or colder. It becomes stone dead. They say this is normal yet last year I had a 2017 van sit for 2 months not plugged in and it started no issues. Everyone including mechanics not associated with jeep say this is not normal but the jeep dealers say it’s normal. I have to deal with it. To top it off I traded my 2019 Jeep Compass in case the 4 wheel drive kept failing (3 times). The 3rd time getting it back the back end fell out 1/2 hour later. So I traded it in having to up my payments and locked in for more years. My only recourse possibly is to get a 3 party opinion in which could cost me thousands. I would never suggest jeeps.

They SAID they checked everything out and said it was fixed, said ""it must've had a leaf stuck over the drain"". Now, it's 1.5 yrs later and suddenly my back seat and front are soaked again. I used a wet vac to get a little over 1/2 a gallon of water up. Now I have to pay another who knows how much to have Jeep check it out again, plus another couple of hundred dollars to have it sprayed with mold treatment. I read other people's reviews and there are too many examples to list with the same issue. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER JEEP, OR A CHRYSLER EVER AGAIN.",1.0
"2017 Jeep Cherokee history: Found rust on left rear door seam, this is a new vehicle, tried to return the Jeep but the request was denied and promised the fix would be permanent. Took 2 weeks to fix and during the repair I was notified they checked the other rear door and noted rust and repaired both. This Jeep is garaged and only has 12000 miles. Found rust again, service stated body shop was unable to get to it until 2022. Now April 2022 and still can't get an appointment as body shop ability issues. Hello 8 months. This is a major problem.

Purchase a Jeep Cherokee Limited Edition back in September of 2015. Vehicle has been great since recently. Engine light came on and some fuel sensor went on the vehicle. The Jeep Dealer changed the part and updated the Engine software and supposedly this ECO Light / Mode feature is no longer available for this model. Worked great for 5 years and now I have to live without it. According to FCA it used to work off the Radio feature through RA3/4 and the software update zapped it I guess? Was considering purchasing a new Jeep but am rethinking that option at this time at least until I can get a valid reason as to why anyone would lose features once purchased. Not the vehicle I purchased believe it or not...,1.0
I am the owner of 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Eco Diesel. I purchased this vehicle hoping to keep it for a long time. I have had over 16 different cars and trucks in my driving years. I have never had vehicle in the Dealership so many times for updates and check engine lights at least 7 different times in two years. The latest breakdown is a leaking fuel line. Could have been a dangerous problem had I not noticed it leaking. The Jeep has never spent a winter in NY. Purchased this in Florida and I spend every winter in Florida. This line is under metal guard so it is never exposed to the elements. You can't buy just the one line. You must buy the fuel line bundle. Jeep will not even listen to me the Jeep has only 63000 miles. This is the last one I will ever buy. Customer Sevice is bad and reliability of this is terrible.,2.0

"This is my third Jeep Grand Cherokee in the last 21 years. I bought a new 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee - Limited and now have 79,000 miles on it (02/20). The size fits the nitch of not being small, and yet not bulky like the larger SUVs. It has had a couple of small recalls and three extended warranty (72-77K) items repaired ($5,500), at my $100 deductible each (Front end/valve cover gasket/radiator). It rides nice, though a bit rocky on sharp really bumpy turns; stiffer suspension than a car. Low road noise. Handles the road well in all driving conditions. Front and rear seats are comfortable, but not plush. Great sound and NAV systems. 
      I keep cars for around 8-10 years, 100-120K miles; that is why I always buy the extended warranty, always pays for itself in the long run. Spacious back cargo area and easy drop down rear spit seats. A great perky V6, which handles nice, but not luxury; whether you are single or a family of 2-4, this a great vehicle to drive with confidence.",5.0
"I purchased this truck 2018 with about 6k miles on it. As of today I have about 34k miles on it. I had to replace the battery last year, just found out that it needs a new thermostat in it which is going to cost me over $700 to repair. Not only that they are told me last year that the rotors needed to be turned because the truck was sitting, the first year I had the truck I put over 15k on it, is that sitting? NO it's not. People would tell me that I will never buy another truck if it's not a Jeep. WRONG!!! I will never purchase another Jeep. I am not getting any help on this matter from the manufacturer. I understand that warranties expire but to find out from a dealership that this truck has had issues with the thermostat and they are not doing anything about it, I don't want to deal with that. I do not recommended this truck to anyone. I am wanting to take it back to the dealership and give them the keys and walk away, that's how bad it is.",1.0

The 4x4 in the jeep is great but not as refined as my last Edge AWD. The 3.2 v6 with the 9 speed trans is more peppy than my past Edge 3.5 v6. The only week link is the transmission.

"There have been several issues with this vehicle. First very soon after the purchase of the vehicle I noticed paint peeling off of the backup screen electric eye area. Took the vehicle into the dealership and told them about it and they dabbed a little touch paint on the area and said I agreed to the process. I never did. Second the vehicle started using a quart of oil every 2000 miles and again I took it to the dealership and they told me that was normal for my vehicle. Thirdly, the paddle shifter quit working and again I took it back to the dealership and they told me not to use that feature. Chrysler warranty a big joke. Not happy one little bit.",2.0

I got this on the recommendation of a Jeep owner who is part of a Jeep loving family. I wanted a dependable practical 4wd that could tow a medium heavy load. It’s had a few maintenance needs that all cars need. Repairs and maintenance averaged $300.00. Brakes were more. It’s black and I almost didn’t buy it for that reason- just don’t relate to black painted cars. But it was. In good shape and drove well. I’m glad I bought this Jeep.,4.0

"I purchased 2019 Jeep Cherokee and within 10-15,000 miles I began to experience oil consumption problems. After several visits to the dealership service dept, and oil consumption program, I was able to receive a new engine. However, after just 3 weeks, I checked the oil, and noticed it was already down 1/2 quart. Once again, the car has been in the service dept and again placed on an oil consumption program. Most likely will need another engine. I have received nothing but the run around with this vehicle, which I feel Chrysler should take responsibility and pay off the loan and/or replace the entire vehicle.",1.0
"In short, my 2019 Jeep Cherokee had been in the shop 4 times for Uconnect issues. Radio/Audio, Bluetooth was lost multiple times and I would have nothing. The last time it occurred I brought it to the dealer and the service manager witnessed it. However, when it got to the tech, it was not occurring. I opened a case with Jeep, got assigned a caseworker, and that was it. I tried to reach out to the case manager multiple times as did the service dept. They ""said"" it was going to a specialist, but no one ever contacted the dealer OR me.
      After a week of this I ""finally"" got the Jeep back and traded out of it to a BMW. I understand from the dealer and the car rental folks Uconnect is a major issue with all of these vehicles. Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler refuses to address this and the customer suffers. I was a long-time Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep person...but no more. Look at the other blogs and such, Uconnect (intermittent issues) are plaguing these products. I would look elsewhere.",1.0

"I leased a 2019 Jeep Cherokee on March 09, 2019. I had it for a day less than a week and it went into limp mode while trying to pass a vehicle.

Had to go 20 miles per hour due to going back into limp mode. Called Chrysler to come get it. They never showed up until the next day and it has been in the garage till this day May 28, 2019 and they are fighting me about getting out of my lease!! I have always been a Jeep Girl but I will never own a Jeep even if you paid me to drive it!! I am currently fighting Lemon Law for a 2019 Leased Jeep Cherokee and Jeep as well as Chrysler.

"I purchased a Jeep Cherokee Sport 2015 about 3 plus years ago. Since the day I left the lot (Jack Phelan Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Countryside, IL) that car created one problem after another. Some of the issues were dealership related, like the broken windshield, flat tire, oil marks on the inside of the interior and replacement of the interior seats, the wrong ones. But in general, the quality of the car was sub-par to say the least. The engine problem, which really should be recalled, has stalled or stopped over 17 times. Seventeen! 
      This all happened in the middle of the street or intersection. Just disturbing. The agony and stress of owning this vehicle has swayed my belief in Jeep cars and the stress of owning this vehicle will never go away. As a result, I've traded my 35k Jeep (took a loss on the trade in) for a Kia. Nothing wrong with a Kia, just not my first choice. If I could afford it I'd drive an Audi or Land Rover, but that's life. Poor Quality to focus on Quantity. Good Job Jeep Cherokee!",1.0
"I bought the 2018 Jeep Cherokee with 13,000 miles. I drove it about 2 months and it stalled. Eventually, I discovered that it was out of oil. Seems the low oil pressure warning (DING!) only came on for 1/2 second during hard turns (I looked quick). I assumed someone forgot to change the oil at the dealership, and it worked fine when the oil was replaced (full synthetic). Within 1500 miles, stalled again. Checked the oil and it's bone dry. Leak? Nope, I park it at work and home and no oil spots. Checked the forums and this is typical. Local dealership suggests I just check and top off the oil every time I fill the tank. REALLY?! Now, the ""Service Shifter"" lights come on and locks up the console and shifter indicator. This too is ""normal"" according to forums and can be reset after re-starting the car (about every week it comes on). When are they going to force a recall on this piece of junk. Never again.",1.0
"I recently purchased a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk with all the bells and whistles “lane assist, forward collision warning. etc."" After a couple months of driving the Jeep I noticed my 4x4 wasn’t working and I had developed a oil leak from the oil cooler. I call my local Jeep dealer and schedule an appointment, they agree to fit me into their schedule ASAP to get my warranty work completed before my warranty expired. So a few days later I take my Jeep in to have the oil cooler and PTU replaced. The dealer I took my Jeep into service was backed up and it would take a week or so to complete the work. A week went by I called to see the progress on my Jeep and come to find out they can’t get to the PTU “Power Train Unit"" replacement until next week. So I and the service advisor agree to let me come get my Jeep and make another appointment for the PTU. No big deal.
      So another week goes by I drop my car off for service. Was suppose to be a 2 day gig at most. Turned into the better part of a weekend “Thurs- Monday.” After receiving my Jeep back all seemed well but I noticed the Jeep was pulling slightly to the left. I checked my tire pressure and they were all good. The Jeep was pulling to the left but not to the point of concern. I figured I needed an alignment and that was all.A day or so later I was getting on to the highway doing roughly 50-55 taking my granddaughter to school when my Jeep all of the sudden lost control. It pulled me hard to the left. I tried to correct the vehicle turning to the right when the front driver's side tire came off the vehicle being sucked underneath the car, sending me into the bar ditch and into the safety barriers. I am aware that the Jeep Cherokees are known for lower ball joint issues on the 2013 models and I believe my vehicle is one of the few 2014 models with the same problem. Anyways my Jeep was destroyed, no airbags went off in the crash and the whole front end was destroyed. Thank you for your time.",1.0

I like having the usb ports and blue tooth sxm radio and the ability to insert sim cards is nice. Heated seats and steering wheel is great. Having power windows and seats are good as well. The only issue I have is the backseat space being so small and when you add three kids in three car seats it’s hard for them to buckle. They don’t have much space for leg room or to buckle if everyone is in there. It’s just super tight back there. But, it's a wonderful updated vehicle.",4.0

That's the thing I like most about it and the reason I chose it over the other vehicles that were available. However, I don't like size of the backseat and the back fours. I have 3 kids, 1 in a booster seat, and when all 3 are in the backseat they are very crowded. The back door openings are also not very large due to the fact that they follow the outline of the back tires which cuts off a lot of extra space to exit the back seat. But it gets great gas mileage for an SUV, in fact, it gets better gas mileage than my mom in law's Impala.",5.0
I had always heard that Jeep was a well-built brand and that they last forever. I was tired of getting a new vehicle every couple of years and the fact that I always have to buy used makes it very hard to get a good quality vehicle so the staying power was my biggest concern. I bought the Jeep Cherokee used so we have had a lot of problems with the battery as well as the engine. The dealer that I bought it from did offer a warranty plan that I took advantage of so the problem with the engine was fixed at no cost to me but not too confident about how long the fix will last. I love most of the options that the car includes but the problems just keep coming always waiting for the next problem to present itself. The parts are also very pricey and it is hard to find someone that can work on them and when you do find someone it takes forever for them to complete the repairs and often times they cost way more than I planned on.,3.0

The ride is not a smooth one but gets you where you're going and able to carry items like a truck. It sits up higher and it is made with metal and not plastic. The look of the Jeep Cherokee is also great, although the doors have been welted rusted. I also hope they make them the same as the older models. Better rust prevention and a better fuel mileage would also be great with the metal body. Nonetheless, it is a reliable vehicle and it is hard to improve a Jeep that has been this great.

"I wanted an SUV that had 4x4 and got decent gas mileage and the Jeep Cherokee has 4x4 and with it not being a full size SUV it would get pretty decent gas mileage which it does. I chose this vehicle because of the incentive that was given at purchase. I also wanted something that was going to be a smooth ride and quiet. So far the experience has been good. Comfortable ride and does very well in the snow too in 4x4. I drive approx 50-60 miles per day and fill up every 6 days. Have had for a little over a year and have had no issues. However, I would change the headlights. I love the bulbs but I do not like the design of them. They are too slanted.

      Bottom line is they want me to spend $29,500 to buy a new 2109 Jeep Cherokee and absolve them from fixing my defective Jeep. Calling FCA is useless. They close the case out with the reason ""it's a dealership issue"" AND they don't even contact me when closing it out. The only way I find out it's been closed is by calling them to get a status on the case. This is a defective vehicle built by FCA, they hide behind the contracted call center.

This is the first vehicle I have taken a lifetime warranty out on because I suspect there will be expensive repairs down the road.

"Purchased a 2017 Jeep Cherokee in December of 2016. We have had nothing but problems with this vehicle. Shifting patterns are horrible. We have had it to the dealer numerous times and have been told that we are the only people complaining about the shifting. One day, pulling out on the highway with plenty of room, the Jeep almost stalled, we had to pull over to the side of the road to get out of the way of traffic. The other day, went to pull out from a stop sign, stepped on the accelerator, nothing happened. All the sudden, it jumped forward into traffic, had to slam on the breaks to avoid getting hit from the side. The person, behind, almost rear-ended us. Forget about using this vehicle to drive up hills, even small ones. It downshifts, goes up over 4000 rpms, then almost feels like it is going to stall. Going down hills, it revives up and goes 10-15 miles faster. We took a list of 9 things wrong with the Jeep, the dealer said that there is nothing they can do.
      Today we were told everything is in our head. Basically calling us liar. We have to get used to driving it different. Was flat out told that we have to drive it like an old person. This vehicle is a safety factor. So much so, that I will not drive it any longer. Went out and purchased a brand new 2017 Chev. Malibu last month. We are stuck with a vehicle that we don't want to drive and have to continue to make payments on. We will never purchase another vehicle from Jeep.",1.0

Only few days a week in summer when the issue happens. As a result dealer always claims the issue cannot be reproduced and check in engine doesn’t give them info to fix it.

I've owned the vehicle 5 months and at 24,950, I was driving along at the speed of 25 MPH when the transmission service, engine, ABS and stability lights came on. My car downshifted. This was very scary. I brought it to the Jeep Service Department that day to be told that it needed a software update (TPM flash). What a joke. I reviewed the vast comments from multiple websites only to find out that the 9 speed transmission is faulty and the software updates (all 21 of them) are a bogus excuse for the Chrysler-Jeep Corporation failing to do the right thing and buy back these defective vehicles.

I bought the NEW car to avoid issues of used car because I'm sleeping in the back of the Jeep. But, big mistake buying American car: NEW or USED.",1.0
"I am very disappointed in the Jeep product. The past 2 Jeeps we have had have had problems before 42,000 miles. The 2015 Jeep Compass had a transmission issue at 21,000 miles. When it was tested, the dealership said nothing was wrong because the computer did not record the issue. We were stranded on the highway in limp mode on vacation! We traded it in because we did not feel safe. These should have been recalled because I see more and more reviews online with the same issue.
      The 2016 Jeep Cherokee also has issues. At 42,000 miles, the battery is not holding a charge because the battery sensor is damaged plus the battery cables are damaged. How did that become damaged? We have had issues with the start and stop for a month before it almost left my husband stranded. Luckily, he broke down at home. It costs and arm and a leg to repair this even though the part online is under $100. I feel as if Jeep is taking us for a ride. We will never buy their product again and will trade this in as soon as we can because we do not feel safe in it. BUYER BEWARE! This product used to have a quality name. Now, it needs some serious quality control before being sold off the lot. We feel scammed.",1.0
"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM them! I bought a brand new 2015 Jeep Cherokee and it has already given me two major problems! Mind you my Jeep hasn't even hit 33K miles. The first problem was a transmission problem and the second, a defective shifter! I have not only had to deal with an unsafe vehicle but the terrible customer service! The people who work here are very unknowledgeable and the last guy I talked to was very rude and implied I was a liar because he kept saying ""He'd check the last phone call"" because he didn't believe I had been told my rental car would be reimbursed. It has been an awful experience dealing with this agency and the only advice I have to say is do your research before buying any Jeeps because you'll probably end up dealing with defective cars and horrible customer service!",1.0
"I have a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Yesterday I had trouble trying to start it. It was acting like it was fuel starved. I had it towed into the local Jeep dealership. They called me this AM and said it was the fuel pump module. They said, and this was confirmed by Jeep, that it was not covered by the powertrain warranty. Now the powertrain warranty is for 60k and my Jeep is only 59k... But they say no this part isn't included even though it's part of the engine. This is the 2nd warranty issue I've had. Last year I had a vibration in the rear end and they said that the driveshaft was damaged... They claimed it was road damage and wasn't covered. Excuse me... But isn't Jeep supposed to be a 4-drive vehicle? Someone told me that JEEP stood for Just Extra Expensive Parts... Boy were they right. This is the first... AND LAST... Jeep I'll ever buy. Jeep = JUNK!",1.0
"I bought my 2017 Jeep Cherokee (2.4 liter with the 9 speed transmission) last November 2016 and so far it has been in the shop 3 times for the same issue: problems with the transmission. The car will not shift down when going up hill. It jerks into gear and sometimes it just will not get into drive or reverse. Going up a hill on the freeway, I'm doing around 45 and when i try to pass someone I have to press on the gas almost all the way to the floor. The engine revs to about 4500 rpm red line is at 6000 and with a clunk the car shifts down to a lower gear so i can pass. The dealer just keeps on reprogramming the transmission computer every time and to no effect. Soon it will be my fourth time with the same problem and then I will be applying for the LEMON LAW. This car is a REAL LEMON.",1.0
"I bought my Jeep Cherokee in 2014. The first few years were great, aside from a few recalls. However, November 2016 I was driving to the gym, made it about .3 a mile until I got an error saying, ""Shift to desired gear"". A few seconds later, my car came to a slow stop. Very dangerous as I was in the middle of a busy intersection. The power was still working, however the engine stopped. I brought it to a Jeep dealership and they tried to replicate the issue with no success. After more than 8 hours (and no rental car provided), they told me they couldn't do anything.
      About 2 months later, the same thing happened again. I brought my car to a different Jeep dealership, who tried to replicate the issue but couldn't. They sent me on my way with no explanation. It then happened again 4 months later, so I had it towed to a different Jeep dealership. As you can guess, they tried to replicate the issue but couldn't. To get a second opinion, I went to two separate local mechanics who were outraged Jeep couldn't fix it, because clearly something was wrong. There is no consistent pattern when this happens, therefore it could happen at any time.I'm VERY disappointed with Jeep and its product. It's a shame because I really wanted to like Jeep/Chrysler. I've always had either a Toyota or Honda due to their reliability, but was hoping this would work out. However, because they can't give me an answer or offer a solution to my problem, I am trading it in for a Toyota Rav4 or Acura. What kind of reputable business has a problem, but does offer to find a solution?! Especially when lives are at stake? DO NOT BUY THIS CAR. It is simply not safe.",2.0
"What a horrible experience!!! I bring my jeep 2017 Cherokee in for check engine light. The service writer (Amitol I think was his name, west Indian gentleman) tells me it shouldn't be a problem. Around 3 still no response so I called in and he tells me the car was in an accident and they won't replace the automatic grill sensor!! Accident?? What accident? I get there and the mechanic tells me, 'You were sold a lemon. That's why I don't buy my cars from these dealers especially this one because they all lie.' I didn't buy my car there anyway due to all the negative reviews. He shows me the car is missing some plastic clips that as far as I know were always there. Now they're missing and broken piece of plastic way at the bottom. With those two pieces of information he concludes the car was in a wreck and they won't replace the part.
      Later he tells me this is a pain in the neck job because he has to take everything apart in the front to find out if the sensor is bad, basically he doesn't want to do it. Then he says in his notes car was in a wreck and they won't fix it. The manager Maria I believe who supposedly approved his notes, was nowhere to be found. Then it took another 30 minutes to get the car out of there because my service writer was too busy chit chatting on his personal phone. I took it elsewhere and of course the sensor is bad, no wreck, and they are fixing it. These people are a bunch of lazy people who don't care if you are upset or not. And Anita? Ha! I ask for her and nowhere to be found. The worst part that upsets me is stating my car was in a wreck. How dare they deny me service if it's under warranty and no body damage!!! Had it been in a wreck the part would have been destroyed!!! STAY AWAY.",1.0
"Bought a brand new Cherokee in December of 2015. One year and two weeks with less than 10,000 miles later the transmission starting acting up (locked in 4th gear). Dealer reflashed computer and acts like it is normal maintenance. On the drive home (less than 10 miles) the problem repeats itself. A new computer was ordered and three weeks later it arrived and was installed. Three weeks after that the transmission locks up again and I was told it would take 2 more weeks to get the valve body to replace. Contacted Jeep customer care and after finally getting in touch with a person they agreed to a rental car. Well I get a call today saying that on the test drive the transmission went out (blocking an intersection) and had to be towed back. Now the transmission will be replaced in about 2 weeks.
      While Jeep seems to be ""trying to fix the problem"" I feel like I am just being strung along until the warranty runs out and will then be stuck with repair bills. I bought a new car so I don't have to worry about these problems, instead I have a $30k unreliable and unsafe vehicle that I cannot drive. Mark my words. This car is going to cause the death of someone before long the way the transmission gives out. Maybe then FCA will do something to correct the problem for good.",1.0
"I bought my 2015 Jeep Cherokee with 24 miles on it. From early on it has had an issue with the transmission. It basically ""clunks"", literally falters between gears at times during which it doesn't accelerate. Started just between 3rd and 4th but now does it between other gears. Have noted this everytime I take the vehicle in for service. Repeatedly told that until the check engine light comes on and the computer tells them what is failing, they aren't allowed to fix it. I will NEVER buy a Jeep again. So discouraged. I bought the ""top"" of the line, Limited Jeep Cherokee with the 3.2 engine and while it's got great bells and whistles, I hate to drive the car and I'm still paying for it. I still owe more than what I can get to trade it in, I won't sell it to a friend because of this issue.
      The Service Manager at my local dealership in Wichita KS has told me and now my fiancee, because we needed to be sure I wasn't getting the talk to the hand because I'm a woman, that Chrysler is fully aware of this issue, that there are at least 2-3,000 out there doing the same thing due to the 9-speed transmission, and they continue to sell this product. Not ever to me again. I hope this stops someone from buying a Jeep and potentially getting a lemon like I've got. My concern is that I'm now at 35K miles and almost out of the warranty period and that darn light will probably come on at 37 or something. That will not be a fun day.",1.0
"My 2013 Grand Cherokee has a rear window leak that runs down the inside window into the wiper unit. Jeep would only cover it under the ""basic"" warranty (3 yrs/36K). Even with my extended ""Lifetime"" warranty, they would not cover the leak as I am past the 36k. We have 9 cars and I have NEVER know a front or rear window too loose. It's seal. REALLY JEEP?? With the recalls on both my Grand and '07 Wrangler, I will never buy another Jeep or related product. Not made like they used to be!",1.0
"I bought my Cherokee brand new from Heritage Dodge/Jeep/Chrysler/Fiat of Owings Mills, MD. For the last 10 months, my vehicle has been shutting off while driving. In addition to shutting off while in motion, it is very jerky, hesitant, my 4x4 system has failed out of nowhere, and both the dealer and manufacturer have no idea, nor care to, fix it. My car is still under warranty with less than 35,000 miles. FCA customer service is a joke. I had to escalate to a manager with a certified letter with hopes to getting results before I sue the company in totality for selling a vehicle with known issues. I should have done more research before purchasing this vehicle because I see nothing but horror stories. A class action lawsuit needs to be filed against this manufacturer for putting customers' lives at risk.",1.0
"In June of this year I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee latitude. Four months into purchase I was on the side of the road. In rush hour traffic I found myself not going anywhere. The engine light came on and the 4x4 displayed a temporary unavailable light. As I sat on the side of the road crying I was helpless. I managed to get to a parking lot escorted by roadside assistance. The jeep was towed to Jeep, where it remains. The frustrating part, is I don't have a car. My car is my way to get my son to school and myself to work. I am a case manager so my car is heavily relied on for my job, my income. The dealership is charging me 120.00 just to figure out what's wrong, but it's obvious a transmission issue. So that is 120.00 dollars I don't have. Being a single mother that is a lot of money. It's frustrating beyond words. I can only hope my review helps someone else.",1.0
"Bought 2014 Jeep Cherokee latitude May 2014 with 7 miles on it. It has been to the shop 16 times. I started at Ward Chrysler in Carbondale. They saw it so many times they refused to see it any more. I then went on to 3 more dealerships. When my car had 100 miles on it, it started shifting irregularly. I took it to the shop, ""Recall Fix"". This happened 5 more times within a few months. They replaced over a dozen parts all the way up to a complete wiring overhaul. This still didn't work correctly. I was then driving with my family on the interstate and it completely stalled causing us almost to be hit by a semi truck. 
      I then called Jeep to request a case manager to finally get it fixed. They got it in the shop and the shop fixed more recall issues. I got it back and it completely stalled again. Jeep closed my case and nothing was done. I called back and got a new case started. Jeep recommend a new dealership with a better service department. I took it to them and they stated it need to be seen by a specialist, that would call us in a few weeks time. That ""Few weeks time"" turned out to be a lie that threw us out of our lemon law time frame. I called back in a few weeks asking what happened, the case was closed and there was no intention of calling me back. I opened a new case. They fixed a module in the console. They closed the case while jeep was still in shop, I got it back and it still wasn't fixed. At this time I opened a formal complaint with Illinois Attorney General in November 2015. In February 2015 my car was taken in and not returned until June 22. I was offered a rental car the last two weeks of this since I had to go out of state on work. The Illinois Attorney General has tried to contact Jeep/Chrysler more than a dozen times with only one reply. The reply stated that my vehicle was fixed in February 2016 for a wiring harness. All completely inaccurate info. The attorney has reached out a dozen more times to cite a correction and Jeep and Chrysler REFUSE to speak to him. My vehicle has been sitting in my driveway undriveable for more than 12 months of its 24 month life and 9 months of its life it has been at the shop - literally 9 months in their parking lot being worked on.

"I've had my 2015 JEEP LATITUDE for 15 months. I leased it brand new MAR 2015, Jacksonville Chrysler Jeep. Wanted something with a rear cargo area but 2nd set of seats, low payment and low residual, and shot for 25mpg. I planned on taking it into retirement in next year. From the beginning I noticed what I called an ""inefficient' transmission"", never seemed to decrease RPMS commensurate with the speed. A BIT ""jerky"" but thought it was a quirk of the model or brand. I drove to Ft. Lauderdale, FL last week, 290 miles each direction. Typical feel of the drive all the way down. NO problems. Coming back on a SUN, about 25 mins. into the trip, the SERVICE TRANSMISSION light came on. Called the dealership back in Jacksonville, no service people on duty, talked to a sales ""type"" manager. He said it would be okay.
      I hit driving rain around an hour into my drive. Everybody came down to about 5 miles an hour. When I went to accelerate, NOTHING. It was barely responding. I hit the hazard light and it was ""pedal to the metal"" and eased over SCARILY SLOWLY to the outer lane. It took awhile but I finally got it up to a normal cruising speed. Dropped back, accelerated. Dropped back accelerated. Seemed to be okay--I thought. I stayed the speed limit. Then I had to come to another stop for traffic again. Barely responding. Hit the hazards again, moved over again, pedal to the metal, I finally got it back up to speed. Called the dealership, from the car. Asked ""what in the hell was going on"". He told me to stop somewhere, turn the car off, shut it all down. Start it back up again. How strange! So I'm driving, normal rate of speed wondering whether I DARE to come to a stop and it not start up again. I googled dealerships along the way. I needed to go to work on MON, had a cargo load of ""product"" in the back and really couldn't afford time and no budget to be stuck somewhere overnight, waiting for a dealership to open on MON. I kept going after I called the dealership again. This time the yellow transmission light come on. Pushed through until I HAD to stop for GAS. Got off the ramp, got up to the stoplight. Light changed, car would NOT BUDGE. Hit the hazards, flagged the 2 cars behind me, passed me. Turned off the car, waited for about 10 seconds, turned it back on again. Hit the gas, accelerated perfectly. Pulled into the gas station, started it back up, accelerated perfectly leaving. Got back on the road. Didn't stop again until within 40 miles of home. Came to a dead stop due to an accident. Car would barely budge--again... Turned the car off, turned it back on. It accelerated. Stopped again, wouldn't accelerate, turned it off and booted it--3 more times getting off the road and onto the shoulder riding with the hazards flashing to the nearest exit. Did this 4 or 5 more stops to GET HOME! It was nerve wracking. Apparently every time it came to a stop ""the transmission"" forgot how to work--or ""something"". Got home, backed the car into the driveway, and woke up MON morning and it was towed away on a flat bed. This is day 4. They say they have it fixed. It was obvious they didn't know what was going on until late TUES. We'll see.I figure I would start DOCUMENTING this situation. I've asked for detailed logs of what they did. I called an attorney to ask about Florida's ""lemon law"". Making notes. Lots. If any of this helps anyone else, feel free to use it. If we are able to ""update"" these entries, I will do that as well after I get it back tomorrow and enter the SPECIFICS from the work orders. Keeping my fingers crossed but from some of the stuff I've read about Jeep Cherokees, I have very guarded optimism. P.S. I left on the trip with about 10,600 on the odometer. It was about 15 miles over 11,000 when all this crap started happening.",3.0
"DO NOT BUY A JEEP! I bought my Jeep 15 months ago - within that 15 months my 2014 Jeep Cherokee has been in the shop 12 TIMES!!! That is about once every month! It has needed a new exhaust within a month of owning it, a new belt, new PRNDL module and lots more! AND to top it off so many recalls. I contacted Jeep about all these issues I have been having and it is like talking to a wall! They are extremely rude and could care less. We have been playing phone tag. When I do talk to them they just say we will get back to you in 24 hours...! I have asked multiple times to talk to a supervisor and they say this will put in for one to call me. I have yet to talk to a supervisor (and this has been going on for over 4 months now...)

Purchased a brand new 2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude October 2015. The transmission never seemed right like the shift points were wrong. Now after recall computer flash done by the dealer the transmission slips and is getting worse. Informed that I need a new transmission at 11thousand miles.

"I bought a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk in August 2014. This was a Certified Pre-Owned Jeep with 7,000 miles on it for $25,999. The going price $39,999. Little did I know Eastchester Chrysler in the Bronx, NY sold me a defective Jeep. My Jeep has been in the dealership repairs about 8-10 times. 4 times on a flatbed. Problem with the Jeep. My dashboard light goes off and on until the battery is completely dead. When the flatbed came to they had to give it a little charge just to move it in the position it was in. When he put the jumper cables on my Jeep I had to hurry up and get the break of in order to get it on the flatbed. First time my Jeep was taken to the dealership all they did was charged the battery. Second time they replaced the battery. All the other times they would keep the Jeep a few days then tell me to come the Jeep because there is nothing wrong with it. Guess where my Jeep is today? In the Chrysler shop. 
      I have a case number with the Corp Management to no avail, they are a joke. As big as Chrysler is they should be ashamed ripping off the consumer with those problem cars. With all the complaints on the Web why is it that BBB or ConsumerAffairs have a class action lawsuit with Chrysler Jeeps. Health wise every time I go to my Jeep my heart starts racing of fear that the car will not start. What I am looking for a settlement by giving me back my down payment and monies which went to the bank each month. I do not want a replacement Jeep Right now. I have a loaner and you would not believe what make car it is. Chrysler 200 2016 and it feels like the Transmission is pulling as if it going to cut off.

"My daughter leased a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trail Hawk new. Twice while traveling on two interstate highways the Jeep's automatic transmission suddenly and without warning failed. The result... she was left stranded on the side of the highway in the middle of the night for several hours waiting for an authorized tow truck. The Jeep was towed to our Jeep dealer and we were informed that the computer module controlling the transmission failed. The second time the transmission failed occurred during rush hour traffic on route 95 on the Connecticut/New York state line (one of the most dangerous roads in the country). She had to move suddenly across three lanes from the left lane to the breakdown lane without power by rolling across the path of 16 wheelers traveling at high speed. 
      She was again stuck dangerously just barely off the side of the road waiting for a tow truck. Fortunately the tow truck operator knew how much danger she was in and made the proper calls to expedite service. The car is now in another Jeep dealership waiting for a replacement module again for the same issue. In each case the dealerships were professional and were very attentive. I can't ask her to get behind the wheel knowing this could easily happen again with, perhaps, fatal results.",1.0

"Just wanted to warn Jeep owners or possible Jeep owners about my experience with a 2014 Jeep Trailhawk. After 4 months of ownership, my wife was involved in a head on collision where a man ran his truck into her. My pregnant daughter and 14 month old grandson were also in the vehicle. I am a firefighter and was the first on scene to set up command on the accident. Imagine my horror when I found my family involved. Let me just say that thankfully, all were transported to the ER and suffered minor injuries. No thanks to the airbags as none of them deployed.
      I contacted Jeep and the NHTSA to file a report. Jeep sent an investigator who gathered information that was sent to Jeep engineers. I got a reply from a Lisa ** that basically said your vehicle did not meet the deceleration limits. My wife was driving approximately 45 MPH at the time of the accident. From that to a complete stop did not set off the airbags. Now as a firefighter, I have seen several hundred wrecks in my career and have been to many where airbags deployed at far lesser speeds. As this concerned me, I attempted to contact Lisa. After several weeks of getting her voice message box full, I was finally able to leave her a message to please contact me as I had some questions about their findings. No reply.I contacted Jeep's complaint department several times and was finally emailed by the investigation group. Here is part of what they sent me. ""The air bag system in your Cherokee is designed to supplement the protection offered by safety belts in an impact of sufficient severity. Air bags are intended to deploy only in full frontal crashes, or certain types of side and rollover crashes. Deployment is not based upon vehicle speed; rather, deployment is based upon the rate of deceleration as measured by the forces of gravity (G force) upon the various acceleration-type impact sensors, or by a pressure wave within a front door as measured by the pressure-type impact sensor.""I am not wanting to sue or do anything of that nature as again, my family came through with minor injuries. I just wanted some reassurance that if you pay several thousand dollars for a vehicle, the safety features would work. I did not get that from letters that, in my opinion, are generic in nature. This was a full frontal crash with no airbag deployment. My wife and daughter both stated they were very much involved in a very violent, abrupt incident. Just wanted to warn owners and potential owners of what happened to us. (We did have the vehicle in a month prior to get the side airbag recall taken care of.)",1.0
"I decided to make this post in regards to my recent issues with Jeep. But first I would like to start by saying that I love Jeep. I have had quite a few, and I love the Wrangler and always have. Fast forward to my current situation. I purchased my Jeep Cherokee in March. 2 weeks after I bought it I was taking it to the shop for hard shifting, and bucking. The dealership told me they just needed to ""reset"" it so I went along with it. April it's back in the shop and it's worse this time. Take it back and again we ""reset"" it. May came and the car's engine light came on, it stalls out in traffic and I almost get hit trying to take my son to school.  
      I take it back, they say there is nothing wrong and they reset again. So this month my engine light came on driving to school. Took it to a mechanic and they read the code and it was the transmission. I had had enough. I took it to the dealership and called Jeep. Everyone at Jeep in customer care was wonderful. The dealership told me it was a lemon. They replaced parts and the engine light is still coming on. The GM of the dealership called and even told jeep it was a lemon. The mechanic, the service advisor everyone told them so I got escalated in my case with Jeep.  The case manager Ashley is the nastiness person I have spoken to at Jeep. She refused to replace my car, told me lies about things the dealership said, and she even told me she would fix my car several time but I was not getting a new one. I told her yesterday that my car is unsafe and I refused to drive and pay good money for a car that does not run correctly and is unsafe. She said ""well, that's not my problem. You aren't getting another car.""  So I proceed to ask her ""so you want me to drive my 4-year old son around in an unsafe vehicle because Jeep will not replace me with a new safe working car?"" She said ""yes that is what I am telling you."" I am sorry but if I do get in an accident with this Jeep I will be holding Jeep personally responsible as well as Ashley from case management. When I explained to her everything I was told by the dealership and the customer care and she went on to tell me that they were all misinformed and she was the only person whose decision mattered. She lied about what the GM is saying about my car and I know this because I have been speaking with them every day.  I will be continuing to post this issue on the internet and social media until my issues are resolved to my request for a new working product. I love Jeep but this Ashley person has made a very bad impression on me as to the jeep name. It is sad that the Jeep Cherokee has the number one complaint, and my jeep is having textbook issues to all the complaints. It is absolutely ridiculous that they will not replace my product with a different working safe vehicle.",1.0

"My 2014 Jeep Cherokee was fine until July 1st 2015, with 48,000 miles on it, when it started dropping out of gear and going into neutral while driving down the road. I took it to Country Jeep in Oxford, PA where they had it in the shop for 5 days and did a ""flash"" that cost me $100. 1 week later it did the same thing again (actually 12 times in 3 hours while I was trying to get it back to the service dept). They replaced the transmission controller (after 1 week in shop). It started doing the same thing again within 24 hours after I picked it up. This is an extremely unsafe issue to have and I'm glad that I have not had an accident because of it. It's back in the shop for the 3rd time right now... how do I get this fixed once and for all???",1.0
"Bought a new 2015 Jeep Cherokee latitude in WA state from Dick Hannah Jeep. I read reviews religiously and found lots of great things about it. Fast forward a few months Jeep had a major recall on the transmission software and airbags software. On my first oil change they performed there transmission software update and airbag update. I noticed a difference right away with the transmission shifts and throttle difference. I called Jeep and asked how it was supposed to make the transmission last longer (which was the reason for the update) because it was shifting really weird. They said it has a ""learning period"" after the update to adjust to the drivers habits.
      On July 2, 2015 I was driving to work I had to stop at a light and as I was slowing to a stop it acted like it kicked down into first gear and started to accelerate. Scary, but I did stop! Then was trying to turn a left across traffic and I pushed gas, got nothing as cars are coming at me. Finally it peeled out and went barely getting T-boned! So I parked at work noticed high rpms! It was hot that day, was thinking it might be that so I turned car off then on same thing high rpms, but I had to go to work. Get off work, turn car on. Little high rpms for idle. Again decided to try and drive it home. It was 12:00am! All of a sudden I felt a jolt in steering wheel to the right and trans light came on and some other crazy lights and I was going 30 mph and the car acted as if it was stuck in a low gear. Really high rpms 4,000+ and I limped home! Looked online and noticed hundreds of complaints about this same exact thing! Took to dealer straight in morning on July 3rd. I had to fight a little for a loaner car. Then they called me at 3 saying it was fixed they had to reflash the update. I was a little worried about the wear and tear on the tranny and car and the safety also the peace of mind of not breaking down. I asked them about these issues and complaints. They said they never had any issues and reassured me it was just a bad flash! I drove away and noticed it shifted really bad. Decided to take it for an extended test drive as I had to leave out of town for the holiday. 4:30 20 miles later exactly it did the same thing! I called instantly, asked them to tow it and get me loaner car as it was unsafe to drive! I was told they can't. They're closing at 5. Bring it in on Monday! Pissed I drove it to Budget and rented my own car for the holiday I had to leave!Monday I brought it in. Fought for a loaner again! 11am they called me and said it's fixed again it was just a new software update again. I said I want to make sure it's not gonna happen again. They agreed to double check. So they asked if I could let them drive it home to their house for the night. I said ""No, I'm not sure about that and how many miles you going to put on it?"" Said they would call me back - never did! I called them the next morning and they said they just took it for an extended test drive and insisted everything was running great! I doubted them and was worried about my safety once again. I believe these cars are very unsafe and also unreliable now! I expressed that to them very clearly! So Jane I think assistant manager agreed and so did a few other one looked to be the manager, but he hide from me as he walked by once he agreed that they have issues and don't know a fix for it yet! As others have transmission replaced and same problems with just a few hundred miles on them straight off the lot! And all have the same story to tell.I drove away, but they said they would hold my loaner just in case because she whispered she knows i'll be back and have this loaner here for me as I had to fight for every time! One mile down the road, boom, does it again! I called them instantly. Said I need them to tow it! They said no if you can drive it here. I was pissed so I did! Dropped it off. Called Jeep case manager. Now they are trying to convince me it's just a small part! I told them it's unsafe and I'm not ok with a new transmission or a rebuilt one because right now it's in the shop ripped apart! They told me they had to order parts for it. I asked what parts. They wouldn't tell me and said they don't know what parts they need to replace as they have not ripped it apart to see the issue! Which I find very strange. I'm in line right now with their only transmission specialist is on vacation. I get a phone call today from Jeep with a new case manger. This is my 3rd one with Jeep/Chrysler. Saying now they are waiting on a tool and they will call me Monday to update me! So here I am, no Jeep, bad tranny and no answers! Which a lot of people are dealing with as well. I have been in contact with many Jeep Cherokee owners now. They all are contacting lawyers. I bought a new car so I didn't have to deal with my last issue and bad luck hits me again. BS, I liked this car till the update campaign. Sorry for such a long story! I'm worried about the safety and value of my Jeep now and I don't like having a rebuilt tranny before a second oil change!",1.0
"I immigrated from the RSA in Dec 2014 to Melbourne Australia. I purchased a Jeep Cherokee Longitude thinking this was my first choice of a family vehicle for safety aspects and to navigate me around the country as I am a foreigner. I paid cash for this vehicle and this vehicle had issues which needed to be rectified. The Sat Nav does not pronounce the street names correctly example going from one destination to another. It takes me across the ocean. Every time I take the vehicle to Jeep I keep getting the same story that Jeep is working on the software update. The paint work on the Jeep is not up to standard. Going on for 7 months of having the vehicle the paintwork that has been done, the paint work done is worse than before i.e. there is no orange peel left.
      In the 6 months that I have had the vehicle which I purchased from Bayside Jeep my vehicle has been there in the workshop for a period of 3 months. I'm still not satisfied with the work carried out. I have sent numerous emails and phoned telephonically for the Dealer Principal of the branch to please make contact with me urgently to no avail. Please could the Head Office of Jeep Australia contact me to address and resolve these problems. Let's hope we can resolve these issues amicably otherwise I will have no other choice but to take action against my statement above.",1.0
"We bought a Jeep Cherokee Sport and 8 days after we bought it, while I was driving, the lights and alarm started to go off. The Check Air Bag, Check Brakes, and Check Air Pressure warning kept flashing. The second day it did it again but this time the car stopped right in its track and wouldn't go. It kept telling me the vehicle needed to be stopped. I managed to turn it off and then turn it back on and park it before it did the same thing again. It would not turn on but the lights on the dash and screen and the radio would not go off. I called Covert and they said they were sending Enterprise Rental to pick me up and gave me the # to Roadside Assistance. 
      The guy I spoke to asked where I was but did not ask me the address. He later stated that he asked if I was nearby and stated that Enterprise had called me twice and couldn't reach me. He yelled at me and stated that he did ask and he assumed I was at the one near him but we live South and I was at a different location than what he assumed. He yelled at me and stated that he did ask. I was not pleased with him yelling at me. I waited 2 hours after the tow truck picked up my vehicle and finally called my husband to pick me up. Roadside assistance towed my vehicle to the Chrysler Dealership south and they called me the next day and asked what was wrong with the vehicle because other than the dash being disassembled (the tow truck driver had to do something to take it out of gear to tow it) they could not find anything wrong. He said the vehicle started and seemed alright. I advised him of the last 2 days events and he said he would check it out and give me a call Monday or Tuesday when it was ready. I also advised him of the rude service I had received from their counterparts and he stated that he was there to make sure I was well taken care of. We'll see about that. My vehicle had 160 miles on it, 9 days old when it was towed. Luckily I was not on the freeway or I could have been killed.",1.0
"I leased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Limited with the Mopar 8.5-inch radio. After 4000 (4 months) the radio blew. I took it to get serviced at Riverdale in the Bronx. They told me the radio unit had a short and burned. Then they told me they had to re-order the part. They could not give me a loaner or a rental because it was not considered a safety issue, so they gave me the car back - this time with no radio and just a big hole where the radio used to be. 
      After a week (they called to tell me to radio would come in), I took off from work to come in again and this time they told me that the part was in back order and would not be available for the next 11 days. I told them that it was completely unacceptable and they had to put me in a car until they could get my issues resolved. They make me call the corporate office, and based on their conversation with the service manager, they also told me that it was drivable and not a safety issue. I explained to them that the climate, heated seats, Bluetooth, and backup camera were all part of the system that I could no longer control. How is it not a safety issue when the heated seats turn on and off without notice in the middle of June in NYC, and the climate control system doesn't work? properly.I was told I would be contacted by a senior service case manager to see what they could do together me in a car until my jeep is ready. My complaints areas follow: (1) They should not tell me that my car is drivable. The car is brand new and they should stand by their product and not tell me to drive it. I am paying for the extra options that they are not calling safety related. (2) Are they going to reduce my payment because I do not have access to my car and now have to pay cab service to get where I need to go? All in all the experience is a nightmare. My suggestion is stay away from Jeep.",1.0
"Feb 2015 my 2014 Jeep Cherokee lost power while traveling on Thruway. Electric stays on but speedometer reads 0. Messages come about not being able to shift gears while in motion and 4wd is not available. I was not shifting, and neither attempting to go into 4wd. Had to pull over, shut down, and start up again. It happened again June 2 on Thruway. Same messages. Again had to pull over, shut down, and start up. Both times could have ended up poorly when you think about it. Happened again 2 days ago. This time while pulling into my driveway. It's at dealership now. They will probably tell me same thing as last 2 times.

"I just received yet ANOTHER recall on my 2012 Jeep Cherokee. I work hard and wanted a good dependable car since I travel from Long Island to the Adirondacks to care for my parents...

I have tried to get in touch with Chrysler but there are no links to contact... 
      As usual they have all the corporate pictures with the owners and how great they are and how they are all about safety? Going back to Ford. Done with these people who say they care about our safety. Do they put their families in a Jeep Cherokee that can just turn off while driving? Please let me know what they or their sons or daughters are driving and I will buy that car! They do not have the balls to talk to you.

"I have a 2014 Jeep Cherokee with about 20,000 km on it. In the past few weeks the liftgate has been opening intermittently on its own. I thought at first it was the key fob but it opens even when the key is in my hands, i.e. not in my pocket or accidentally pressed. I took it to a dealership. They could not find anything and sent me away. Now whenever I put the car in park the liftgate opens. The key is in the cup holder so it is not being pressed at all. Does anyone else have this problem? Have you found a solution?",3.0
Yesterday I noticed a large quantity of motor oil on the driveway and on garage floor. I found the bottom of car saturated with motor oil by oil pan. I took new 2014 Jeep Cherokee to dealership and they verified that a part was probably cracked on the oil filter assembly. Currently I was told that jeep has had this issue and there is a two week backlog to get the replacement. I can drive it and take a chance on it catching fire or park it for at least two weeks. I did not buy a car to just let it sit because there are no replacement parts. Guess what Jeep can do with their warranty. I was refused a loaner car for the two weeks and told to rent a car. Jeep will never see me again nor Greenway dealership. This situation of cars with Greenway reminds me of another encounter with this dealership.,1.0
"I purchase a new Jeep Cherokee on the 31/1/2015 - four weeks later the transmission broke down.

They did that then rang me on 16/4/2015 and said, ""Had taken for test run and still breaking down"". Now they're going to find a new replacement transmission - who knows how long that would take seeing there was not one in Australia to start with.

"In June 2010 I bought a Jeep Cherokee Limited (also known as a Liberty in some countries). This vehicle had the following MAJOR issues that required tow truck assistance: Major fuel line leak; Turbo inlet failure; major coolant leak (inside the vehicle); Total engine failure; Transmission failure. This vehicle also had the following MINOR issues (this shouldn't happen on a new vehicle): Failure of seatbelt tensioner; Rattling in drivers door; Faulty rain sensor; Radio clock resets; Loss of all climate controls; Bash plate falling off; Loose external mirrors.
      I contacted the Dealer and Fiat Chrysler head office requesting a full refund or vehicle replacement. I then escalated to The Office of Fair Trading who also contacted the Dealer and head-office, but they simply refused (there is no law to protect the consumer in Australia). I met with head office who offered me... wait for it... a free battery! I took them to the Queensland Civil and Administrative tribunal, but they even refused a refund or replacement there, as they knew that this tribunal could only make rulings of up to $25k and this Jeep cost me $49k.I was left with no option but to sell my Jeep to another sucker, but I refused to pass on my problem, so I mounted a campaign to publicly destroy my Jeep. In 2014, we tore it apart in-front of around 250 people and camera crews and even had a member of parliament at the event, supporting our campaign. We are campaigning for the introduction of Lemon Laws to Australia and currently have 2 petitions with the government for review.

"I recently purchased a 2014 Jeep Cherokee with a 3.2 l engine, a nine speed transmission and a trailer towing package. Shortly after I purchased the vehicle, I could feel a slight vibration in the steering wheel and could hear a low droning sound when the RPM was at 1250 with a slight positive throttle pressure. The sound and vibration occurred at the same RPM in all gears that hit that same range. Now 6 months later, I have approximately 8000 km on the vehicle and the vibration and sound have increased to the point I can feel and hear it every time the engine hits 1250 RPM. This unfortunately occurs at approximately 30 kph, at 45 kph and 60 kph which is all the speeds that we travel while driving in the city. The sound and vibration do not occur while driving at highway speed as those gears do not coincide with 1250 RPM.
      When I first felt the vibration and heard the droning sound, I took the vehicle to the shop and the test driver said nothing was wrong with the vehicle. I expected that would happen so I left feeling comfortable that at least I lodged the concern. I felt that the situation would most likely get worse and I would bring the vehicle in when it did so. The other day I did take the car to the shop and tried to take the service man for a drive. They advised that a current recall would fix the problem so they actually applied 2 recalls and neither solved the vibration and sound issue. I returned to the shop to hear the the shop foreman had tested 3 other Jeeps and all exhibited the same droning sound and vibration and that it was common to all jeeps. I stated that it was not normal, however the shop foreman stated that maybe not normal but that a recall had not been received to repair this problem.Out of frustration I went to a second dealership and asked the shop foreman if they had heard about this issue. They advised that they had not but volunteered to take a drive with me. The serviceman acknowledged that there was a droning sound and a vibration that he could feel with a hand on the console. He asked me to take a drive in a new vehicle closely matching mine and sure enough, a vibration and sound could be felt and heard at the same RPM. Is anyone else having this problem?",2.0
"I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk. The check engine light turned on. I took it into the dealership and worked on it for 2+ hours. They were going to perform so update. The advisor stated that they fixed it, however during their test drive the light came back on. It was their closing time and the advisor said ""you can leave it or bring it back in the morning."" I asked ""Is it safe to drive?"" He replied that it would drive like it did before. So I started home and 2 miles from the dealership the vehicle started jerking/bucking. So I tried to turn around and the transmission completely died in the middle of the road. I could not move from on coming traffic. I almost got T-boned. Roadside assistance came an hour later and had it flat bedded back to dealership. I had to pay the flatbed drive $20.00 for ride home. 
      Today they picked me up and gave me a Chevrolet Sonic to drive. Are you ** kidding me. Anyway 1600 miles on the vehicle. I will diligently pursue a Chrysler buy back. I want to get as far away and as fast as I can from any Chrysler related. Total **!!!! $40000.00 can allow you to drive around in a Chevy Sonic. I am in the Auto business and have many contacts.

"I loved my 2014 jeep cherokee when I saw it at the dealership. No problems the first 6 months other than an occasional jerk when the auto transmission slipped. My problem is the radiator fluid that keeps leaking on my carport. I have had it in the shop at least 5 times in the last 6 months or so for this same problem. They have had it there from one to 14 days each time. They can't figure out where the leak is coming from. They have changed several parts. The have tried to fix it. It also has had the transmission flashed and computer flashed (updates) several times. Sometimes the transmission still jerks a bit but my biggest concern is the radiator fluid leak is getting worse. Now the temperature is starting to go up higher as I drive it. We had to add anti freeze tonight to keep it from overheating. There is a rubbing noise coming from the steering wheel on the inside of the vehicle. You always smell the hot antifreeze dripping on something inside the motor. 
      Some days when I go out in the morning the carport is covered with antifreeze and some days there is nothing dripping. The guys at the repair shop have tried to fix it and every time they have changed different parts out on it. This car will be a year old in March 2015. I have had so much stress and missed work since I live 45 minutes from the closest dealership. I love the way it drives and looks but it stinks that for the last six months or so I haven't had it in my possession but about half the time. It's going back to shop on Monday to have the steering wheel noise fixed and to try to find the leak in the coolant system again. So disappointing when you buy a new vehicle for the first time and it has so many problems. I keep hoping that maybe this time they will figure out what is leaking.",1.0

"I bought a Jeep Cherokee Limited for $38k last year and here have been the problems with it: cruise control - no matter what you set the cruise to, if you go downhill, it will not brake or hold you back. I've had my parents in the car and they've seen it get up past 86 mph even when its set to 70 mph. The Jeep went back to the shop twice over this issue and I was told nothing could be replicating although right after taking it home, I was able to get it to do it with my parents in the car. This is really unsafe. Radio duplicating MP3 files and some times triplicating them. It would have the same song list on the SD card or flash drive many times. After turning on car, it would do this. They tried to software update it and fix it 3-4 times. It was fine until recently, I saw that it had started doing it again.
      Radio would lock up on me then the whole dash would freeze up. Shutting down the car and turning it back on would not solve this issue. You would just have to wait it out until everything went black, then it would reboot and start working again. They tried software update to fix this issue. To me this is unsafe when the whole radio and dash shuts down on you while driving. Engine - I was changing oil on the Jeep and noticed oil leaking from the engine. It had about 17k miles on it so I took it in. They were able to find the leak and put some RV on the bolt to get it to stop. I just changed oil again on my car and noticed what appeared to be oil leaking in about the same place. The engine is going to need pulled to get this fixed correctly.Broken fog light switch - after I bought the car from Urse, I noticed the fog lights were on and my high beams weren't working that well so I went to turn the fog lights off. I noticed the button was sideways a little bit but didn't think about till went to push the button and it shoved all the way up into the dash. I pulled off in someone's driveway and noticed the switch appeared to have been broken either being built or after being delivered to dealer. They had to order whole assembly to fix the issue. Fuel door - this was happening last year at purchase and just recently went back to dealer to try to fix again. If it rains, water would go down behind fuel door into the door locking mechanism then if it would freeze. You couldn't get the door open again until you poured hot water down into the fuel door. They stated it was the solenoid that wasn't firing right. It's not that, it's the locking mechanism designed wrong. The solenoid worked fine but it sucks trying to hunt for hot water just to put gas in your car.Shifting - this car has had two software updates to fix shifting issues as it would make loud popping noises when you would put it into gear from park or up-shift while going up the hill and lug down. It was fine for a while and now has taken to shifting up again on a hill and lugging around. Shifter - after picking up my car that night from getting fuel door fixed, I thought the shifter felt weird putting it into gear but didn't think anything of it. I drove home and parked it. I got up the next day to drive to work and when I went to put my car into gear, the shifter broke. I called Jeep and they told me to bring it in and they would fix it. I showed it to them and thought it was going to be fixed then they told me they would need to order the parts and it would be 3-4 days.Heat - heat was messed up and blowing cold air for a while. It had something stuck in it and they had to work on it and get that fixed as well. Oh I tried to trade this off for another car so they pulled up the service history and said they would give me $4,000 less than what I owe on it which means the car is underwater.... So far, Jeep has tried to force me into arbitration. Our Attorney General told me not to go that route because arbitration is sided with Jeep most of the time and he put me in touch with a few attorneys who handle lemon laws. He said that's about the only way you are going to win something like this... I'm pretty sure I'm done with Jeep after this... Chevy is looking better and better....",1.0

My husband took it to the dealership that same day and the car is still there today, Feb. 2nd. The service department has tried two different things neither of which worked. My husband spoke with the service department manager who said he was then talking to Chrysler about the problem which makes we feel that they do not know what is wrong with it.

      The dangerous problem is slowing to stop the transmission at about 30 mph will act like someone puts it in neutral and speeds up, then finds a downshift gear and slams into it. Service manager stated it was an acceptable behavior of the transmission - that's crap. It's been to dealership 5 times - 4 tranny software updates and scheduled to go again on Monday.

"After driving home from work I parked my 2014 Jeep Cherokee in my covered parking spot and did not go out again due to the extreme cold that Dallas TX was experiencing. The next day, when I went to my Jeep and start it, I noticed that there was a hole and all of the glass on either side of the back window shattered and had fallen out. The middle part of the window was shattered but held in place by privacy tinting. I have had the Jeep since the end of August and never abuse my vehicles. There are no children/teens in the area I live to cause damage to property.
      I brought it to the Jeep dealership because this is a new car and should not have a window that was shattered. The police officer believes that it was the extreme cold that shattered the window, which makes me believe that it was defective glass to begin with. Chrysler said they had never seen anything like this before and would not cover it. Glass is not covered on my insurance policy, which has a $1000 deductible so the repair of $500.00 came out of my son's college fund. The repair window is not the same color as the tinting on the rest of the car and it will cost another $100 to replace the correct tint.I am very disappointed in Chrysler's stance on this issue. If they can't take responsibility for something small, how can I trust them to honor the warranty that came with the car? Very disappointed.",2.0
"Where to even start!! I got a brand new 2015 Jeep Cherokee from Bayside Jeep Cherokee in Queens NY.

They towed my car to the closest dealership (since they wouldn't tow it over 14 miles to the dealership I got the car from). The dealership in Queens was no help obviously because all they care about is their commission with selling me the car. I have been getting the end around from Chrysler, and anyone at the dealership to help me with my lemon! All they want to do is ""try and fix the car"".

"Purchased a 2014 Cherokee Limited March 4 2014; after driving it for 3 days I attempted to turn it back to the agency as the trans would hesitate when it attempted to downshift. When it finally would downshift it would hold in gear and not upshift, and the engine would race to over 5000 and sometimes 6500 rams before shifting again. I was advised the new trans would learn my driving habit over the next 6 weeks and not to worry. I trusted Chrysler and waited to no avail. Then was advised a software fix was available, again I trusted Chrysler and was disappointed, BUT then was told a second update would fix the shifting and it didn't. Upon phoning Chrysler customer assistance I was advised a recall was in place for my particular vehicle. Two days later customer assistance advised me that was an error, there was not a recall.
      Now I am awaiting a phone call from Chrysler wherein they are to advise me of what they plan on doing. The vehicle performs ok in 30-40 mph town driving, but I am afraid of freeway driving as the vehicle will not downshift or upshift timely and several times I have narrowly missed a collision as the trans will not provide the torque when needed. In good faith I have trusted Chrysler (their ""offers"") 4 times to fix the hesitation and slow shifting and Chrysler has stated that the vehicle is 'operating as designed' and I have suffered 15,000 miles in an unsafe vehicle. I just want a safe vehicle; the vehicle I 'thought' I was purchasing. Any suggestions?",1.0
"On October 22, 2014, my 2014 Jeep Cherokee's analog speedometer quit working at approximately 2800 miles. I immediately notified the dealer and took it in for service on 10/27/14.

When I didn't hear back, I contacted the service dept. on 11/1/14. They explained that the part was not in yet.

I contacted Chrysler Customer Service and filed a complaint. After 2 or 3 more calls, I was told that they were expediting my claim and the part would be available 11/7/14. A representative from Chrysler called me back that day and said the part was still not available and they went back to their original estimate of 11/13/14. On 11/13/14, I received another call that the part was now on back order. I was not given a time frame of when it would be available.
      In the meantime, I am expected to continue making my lease payments on time. So far, I have lost about 19 days of use of my vehicle including my free trial of satellite radio and UConnect. Until 11/14/14, the loaner vehicles provided by my dealer were not even remotely comparable to my Jeep. This is not acceptable customer service! I want my Jeep back. The most recent customer service person I spoke with told me that my vehicle is not a priority because it is still driveable. Chrysler told the service dept that if I drive the vehicle, they would not send the part as the odometer has to match my mileage. This should be a high priority repair and Chrysler is not holding up their end of my lease. I will never buy another Chrysler vehicle!",1.0
"2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited almost got my daughter and I killed on the freeway. My jeep is 3 mos old with 3500 miles on it and while driving on an overpass at 65mph the RPMs dropped to 0 and service transmission light came on and jeep stop responding. Jeep now says they want to put a new transmission in my new Jeep. Since day 1 the jeep has also been accelerating on its own, getting average 18mpg, shifting roughly just to name a few of the other problems. NEVER in 50 yrs of owning or driving cars have we ever experienced anything like this. Jeep needs to get these messed up vehicles off the road before someone dies because of their messed up product.",1.0
"I purchased my 2014 Jeep Cherokee Sport in February 2014. Week 1 Jeep back the engine light came on. Then the computer dash went out. You could hear it but no way to change anything. 2014 vehicle, already problems. Return to the dealer and said needed to update the computer. Month later returned, shifts very hard. I see it as a hard jerk and the dealership Beaufort Chrysler Dodge, Beaufort South Carolina. I took it back again, again, and again with the same problem. Again they said it was a computer problem but I'm still having this problem. The car has a bad hard shifting problem. I see these problems happen to a lot of people. Recall, it SUCKS. I have called the Jeep dealer to try and get this fix. The dealership Beaufort Chrysler Dodge said that this wasn't their problem and I had 2 take it up with the Jeep dealer. Called the Jeep dealer, expressed my horrible experience. Vehicle still shifts hard, slow to get and go, hearing noise as turn the wheel. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN will I purchase a Jeep again.",1.0
"Bought a brand new 2014 jeep Cherokee sport a few months ago. Transmission shifts hard and increases in speed on its own when going downhill when you barely place your foot over the brake. One tap or two on the brake pedal and off you go. Seems to have a mind of its own. It's not a down shifting issue as much as it literally takes off on its own. Leaving you to really press hard and several times on the brakes to get it to slow back down. Setting in park, it just gives itself gas like you placed your foot on the gas pedal. Shifting thru the gears sounds like a hammer hitting...complete junk. Have only owned this vehicle for a few months and it's already been back to the dealership three times for this issue...only to be told it checks out ok and all updates are current. Jeep has serious issues with this SUV. Needs to be recalled. Several people have the same issues with this 9 speed transmission. Someone is going to get hurt one day because of these issues.",2.0
"Bought a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Sport in December 2013. Couldn't pick up the car the first day because it ""sat too long and needed to clean out the pipes."" Took it the second day and am regretting every moment. Don't listen to the dealer when they say ""Nothing to worry about, that's why it has a warranty."" Well, the warranty has left me without a vehicle to drive for months and frustration that I have never experienced before:
      Updates to transmission weren't done right. Updates don't hold, Exhaust rattles - no fix available. Parking light out - light is not out but there is no fix. Shifts harshly and makes me sick to my stomach to drive and I have never been car sick or sea sick a day in my life. Brakes grab and fade at will. Don't have drinks in the car - it will spill. When trying to accelerate quickly because of oncoming traffic, the car almost stalls. (One very scary time it did stall and the dealership told me it was a safety feature, it shut off the gas so that less gas would be in the gas lines in case of an impact) - I consider this to be criminal behavior and have never set foot in that dealership again. BTW - don't ever go to Jack Key in Las Cruces, NM.I stopped driving the car after too many close calls with getting into an accident. The transmission hasn't ""learned"" a thing and I can't drive it the way it is. After the 10th time of taking it in for the transmission, I'm done. Just waiting to hear back on their evaluation so we can get our money back. We drive 15,000 miles per year average. After 8 months, 3,000 is all we could manage with this one. Chrysler gave us a rental twice, dropped the ball after promising a rental 3 other times. Even after explaining the dangerous conditions driving the car puts us in, they offered an extended warranty rather than money back or a replacement vehicle and said we just needed to drive the car more so that it can learn. BS. Love many other attributes with the car but wouldn't want a replacement , especially after seeing what else is going wrong to others.Not sure how this will all end but I wish the best for everyone who has had to deal with Chrysler. It's been a slow process and I hope they call today and say what I want them to or I will need to get a Lawyer. I will try and leave an update after I hear back from them.",1.0
"I have bought many cars and I can truly say that this dealership has cornered the market on HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My story: Went to look at a Jeep Cherokee and really liked a White Cherokee Limited. My salesman's name was Jeff **. Nice guy but really didn't know much about the product or pay attention to my requests. We agreed on a car and I asked what the rebate was. I was told $1000.00. He had asked me what I wanted to put down and I said nothing but would do a $1000 if he gave me 30 days. He said no problem. 
      Went into finance and learned that the rebate was $500.00, he never told them about the 30 days to hold down and on top of this, he had charged my full invoice for the car. Something that should have been negotiated. SNEAKY. Anyway they ended up taking $500 off the top and gave me till end of month, 6 days, for $1000. To top it off, they are one of the only dealerships I know of that will only give you $30 in gas when you buy a new truck. That's right, thanks for my half of tank of gas. Called spoke to a manager who said 'OH WELL. We got our money, you got the car. Live with it.' STAY AWAY FROM MASSEY YARDLEY. THERE ARE PLENTY OF DEALERSHIPS THAT CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

"This has been the WORST, MOST HORRIFIC experience I've ever had to go through!!! I bought a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee on March 25th to have it in service twice already because the engine is grinding and screeching every time we accelerate, the transmission knocks when we change gears, and there is a clicking coming from behind the dashboard every time we shift. I take the car in to be looked at to be told there is nothing wrong with the car (are you kidding me!?). To have the same problems with the engine and take it back again on May 17th, have a tech acknowledge there is a problem with the engine, have the car in the service area for over a month waiting for this invisible factory representative that supposedly came by on Monday, June 23rd, test drove the car, and said, ""Yes, this is normal. This is a new engine and it’s supposed to do that."" (Again, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!??)
      I specifically asked to be informed when the factory rep was there so I could address MY concerns (after all it just happens to be MY car!) with him/her... No one informed me; I'm told via a Chrysler rep, after the fact, whose only vague answer is to say, ""Your car is running at factory specifications."" Jeep Sansone Service NEVER updates me or calls me back and I'm always the one reaching out for updates. I've asked for copies/records of the service details each time I was there so that I could confirm that my concerns were properly documented, to be told they could not provide me those documents till my car was fixed... I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANYTHING!!!I was told that since I may not have had many cars, which would limit my experience with how engines and transmissions normally sound/work, I wouldn't be able to tell if a car is working normally (how VERY male chauvinistic of your service department!!!). So, in response I asked to compare my car to a brand new car on your lot. Told that I could but once I got to the dealership, I wasn't able to drive anything or compare anything. ""No need since we know there is a problem with your engine... The good news is that you're not lying. The bad news is there is something wrong with your engine.""So, if one of your techs acknowledges there is a problem, how the hell does this supposed factory rep just come in, test drive the car, and dub it “working at factory specifications”!!!??? That leads me to believe either your products are made at sub-standard quality, or this is just Chrysler not taking responsibility for a defective car. Not only won't they fix the engine but after talking to the case manager assigned to me by Chrysler (Jenny, who says she is my advocate), she tells me that there is nothing she can do, they won't fix the car and that I need to go pick it up.I asked if I could speak to the factory rep so that I could voice my concerns and he or she could explain to me why this is ""normal"". I was told no, it's against our policy. I asked if I could have another factory rep look at the car... I was told no. I asked if I could get the factory reps diagnosis in writing... I was told no. I asked if I could get documents or records from Chrysler of what tests the factory rep performed... I was told no, it's against our policy to provide anything in writing. I asked if I could get a copy of those policies... I was told no, it is against our policy to share our policies. I asked if I could compare my engine to another car to see if it normal... I was told that is up to the dealership. I asked her to send me an email so that I could list my requests and she could list her responses in writing and she told me that would send me an email but that she would not put anything in writing. I asked for the contact information for her litigation department to provide me lawyer... She told me no, that it was against policy to give me that.

"I have a 2014 Jeep Cherokee that has been shifting funny since I got the car in April. I called and they told me it had to ""learn"" and would smooth out. Not so. I was driving my normal 20 miles to work when all of a sudden the dashboard alerted ""service transmission"". Called the service department who said bring it in, don't go fast and if you break down call a tow truck. They said it needed a software update. Got to the service department in 1st gear (would not shift out so I drove very slow). Got to the dealer and after 5 hours waiting they told me I needed a new tranny. Now it's running ok but smoking... Ughh. Not sure if it's oil burning off or another issue. They need to pay the days I have to take off work to get this straightened out!!!!",2.0

Others obviously have the same issue and Jeep seems unwilling to fix it. This should be taken care of.",1.0
"New 2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited - Bought the Limited fully loaded Cherokee in December. Loved the car at first then started to notice things. The headlight condensation was first. Then the driver door handle lock release only worked half the time. The worst though was the vibration through the vehicle on acceleration especially around corners. Felt it through the Jeep and right into the steering wheel. As a retired mechanic, this did not sit well with me. The 9-speed trans also shifted poorly and would jerk the car sometimes. Took it back to the dealer who kept it all day and told me they couldn't feel any vibration. Right! They also said they couldn't duplicate the unlock failure so I said I would keep an eye on it. 
      Took car back and drove it for awhile but vibration only got worse. Took it to yet another Jeep service center to get them to try fix it. They claimed they could barely feel it or only sometimes. Reset the trans programming and door codes and sent me away again! Drove it two more weeks. Nothing changed and I didn't want to put any more miles on it and lose even more value so I went to Mazda who took it in on trade. Got into a beautiful CX5 GT AWD and couldn't be happier! Gave me great trade in and lower interest rate. Like night and day. Will never buy a Jeep again or any Chrysler/Fiat product. Total time of ownership 5 months.",1.0
"Buying my 2014 Jeep Cherokee less than a month ago was the WORST mistake I have made in my life. I purchased this piece of junk on 4/17/14 and on 5/14/14 my husband took it to the dealership because it is really loud and shakes really bad when I go to pull off. Well the mechanic told us we have an exhaust leak and it is my transmission... switching from 1st gear to 2nd gear and that's completely normal. There's nothing they can do about the exhaust leak. Chrysler has an open case about it, but they have no solution so there is nothing they can do. So basically I'm out of luck. My small babies have to ride in the car smelling the fumes and because it's not considered life threatening in their eyes, I just have to wait until Chrysler comes up with a solution. I have called Corporate 4 times in 2 days and all they're offering is 4 free oil changes. I called again today and they said they're escalating it to higher management. I've called every news media I could, I called an attorney, and I'm in the process of seeing about the lemon law in my state. I've mailed the letter like the websites says. I mailed a copy to the consumer protection division and I will continue to call corporate and the news media to display this horrible company.",1.0
I bought my Jeep a year ago. It is a 2000 Grand Jeep Cherokee Laredo. It keeps stalling on me while I am driving. It also wants to kill on me.

I am at a loss with it. Can't keep doing this.,2.0
"On July, I bought a brand new, out of the box, 2014 Grand Jeep Cherokee. A month later, while driving the steering wheel locked itself on me and the screen began telling me that the tire pressure was low. I took it back t the dealer so they could check and see what it was. All they told me was that they fixed the tire pressure and checked the steering wheel and it was fine. However this kept happening over and over again and every time I'd take the jeep back to the dealer they would practically call me crazy. Then a few months later, on Oct. 8th, while turning left at a light, the steering wheel locked itself and I crashed into a light post. Since the accident, I can barely walk. I have two herniated disks, one on my neck and the other in my lower back. And I can't pretty much do anything because I'm always in pain. Who would have thought that buying a new car would have caused me practically my life. So for whoever that was thinking to buy this car, please look for a different car because the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee is just a time bomb. That can explode and kill you at any moment.

"Over the course of a few months, I noticed that my 2006 Grand Jeep Cherokee Overland would hesitate and then rev up... surging out of a parking space and at times doing the same while putting it in to drive forward. A few months ago, my son was driving the car and while applying the brakes in traffic, the vehicle would not stop and fortunately only slightly struck the car ahead. I explained this to my husband who booed booed it. We had driven the car without any problem for months. On 1/24/2014 while we were in the city of Sanford, he became a believer. As we slowed for a traffic light and he applied the brakes, the car suddenly revved up at a high rate of speed and rammed into a Ford F250 ahead of us. 
      At first I thought someone had hit and pushed us into that truck. My husband stated that he had pressed both feet on the brake pedal. After the accident, the two and one half ton truck had a crumpled bed with fenders bending out. The rear bumper was pushed under the truck. The driver noticed our approach and said, ""I saw you slowing down and then, Wham, you ran into me."" Of course, we sustained damage as well to our Overland. Fortunately, we didn't run into a Mini Cooper. People could have lost their lives. Strange thing is that our air bags did not deploy. Our back seat unlatched and fell forward, the crash was so severe.Just last week, we spent $2200 in repairs for a power steering pump, steering rack and a heat pump. I believe they topped off the fluids. Chrysler said they were sending an investigator. I hope they do and we get results. I have owned Jeeps for years and before that a Rambler. I have always been loyal to the company because I wanted to buy an American product. Right now, I feel deeply let down and glad I am alive. My daughters own seemingly dependable Subaru.",2.0
"2010 Jeep Compass Sports purchased April 2010, about 90K km on it, some scratch, no major accidents. Yesterday, I went for oil change. Was told that ""water pump"" leaked.

How can a major part become so aged? I had a Gr Cherokee in NY 1992. The day I bought it, it was drizzling. Before I turned on the wiper, it started working by itself and would not stop. I bought a Cherokee Classic in Beijing 1996. 2 years later it left me stranded in the middle of a desert. The reason: 1 of the 16 tiny springs for fuel injection nozzles broke. The part cost Y15, but labor was 4000 + 1000 for towing.",2.0
"I am so grateful I didn't buy my 2014 Jeep Cherokee. It makes me want to cry every time I make a $500 lease payment, because I leased garbage and that's the bottom line. At least for me, I get to return this vehicle if I'm still alive after owning it. The SUV is a death trap and I am waiting to be killed on the road. It does not accelerate properly at all. You literally have to floor the gas to get whatever computer program to spark and function. Then the rpms go crazy sounding like the transmission is going to blow up and then the car jerks forward with you slamming into the seat belt. It's awesome to get to experience whiplash on a daily basis. What I'm also experiencing is that when the SUV is trying to shift gears, it's like the computer doesn't know what gear to put the vehicle in so it jerks and hesitates. It is beyond scary to pull out of places because you don't know how the SUV is gonna react. I was almost hit by a city bus because my car was not moving after I pulled out on the road.
      I have noticed that if I turn off the eco button, the car slightly shifts better, but still doesn't drive right. After you turn off the car, the eco button turns automatically back on when you restart the SUV. If you don't remember to turn it off when restarting the SUV, typically a near death experience will happen. For example you will try to merge on the freeway to only be able to go 50 mph when the rest of the freeway is going 70 mph. The RPMs will be going nuts and the engine will sound like it's gonna blow up. Eventually the computer will catch itself and you can go with the flow of traffic. Acceleration must have been an upgraded feature that I didn't check on my paperwork.I also don't find turning off the eco button for the SUV to somewhat function as an option. This eco button was one of the reasons why I leased this SUV. I was downsizing from a large SUV that was not getting the best in-town gas mileage. Guess what? I'm getting the same terrible gas mileage as I did in my large SUV, because my Jeep is not capable of keeping the vehicle in eco mode. So I got rid of a perfectly good SUV to now drive a JEEP that doesn't accelerate, puts my family in constant danger and isn't saving me a dime for gas.When it's raining outside you should drive slow like if you were in a Focus or Prius because this SUV hydroplanes all over the road because of the acceleration issues. Also, if the cruise control works, if you try to pass someone using the controls on the steering wheel, the car sounds like it's gonna blow up. The RPMs go nuts and when you pass the people, it sounds like you want to drag race them from the noise coming from the engine. It's so embarrassing it's not even funny. If you need to fast accelerate, this SUV is incapable of performing this action.Braking System - My Jeep has been rolling backwards at stop signs. If there is any sort of hill, I have to drive my automatic like a stick, keeping one foot slightly on the brake and accelerating with the other. If you don't, you will roll backwards either down the hill or hit the car behind you. Sometimes when you put the car in park, it will lurch forward like an inch. Not on a hill, just in a flat parking lot. If you turn off the air/heat and just want to open windows, that is not an option. There is some heater that remains on and you will sweat to death. The buttons on the touch panel for the heating on the seat and steering wheel will sometimes work. It all depends on their mood. The radio has a mind of its own and it will tell you what volume it wants to play at, not what you selected. You are only capable of getting oil changes at the dealership. I took my truck to an oil change place to have them tell me Chrysler doesn't have after market oil filters for this car. So anytime you need an oil change, go ahead and block out 2-3 hours of your day hanging out in the service department lobby.When I took my Jeep in for the first time, for the numerous items listed above, they discovered that my Jeep had all sorts of recalls. All sorts of recalls that they did not bother to notify me about (still scratching head). You know my Jeep has these acceleration/computer issues and you can't send me a postcard to bring it in? It takes me screaming at a service department guy about the quality of your vehicle for anyone to remotely care. Which I will add they all looked at me like I was crazy when I was explaining what the car was doing.My Jeep was fixed for about a week. They have no idea what is going on with these computer codes and uploads for these numerous computer issues. My guess is they are just resetting the computer and crossing their fingers it works. Maybe if they close their eyes and visualize like ""The Secret"" that will fix the problem too. So now I'm back to driving a death trap again. Jeep is going back in the shop tomorrow. Except now I've got a new issue to add on the list. My steering wheel is vibrating like there is something wrong with the suspension or tires. How is this possible? The car stays parked in my driveway most of the time because I work from home. I live in the city. There is nothing besides paved roads.As far as I'm concerned there is only one fix for these models experiencing these acceleration/computer problems - REPLACEMENT OF THE VEHICLE - YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT!!!! Get these death traps off the road and care about your consumers!!! This Jeep is by far the worst vehicle that I have ever owned.",1.0
"I bought my Compass new off the lot, and while it didn't live up to standard of my 2 former Cherokees, it was fine. After driving it for 4 years I have started having trouble with the CVT. there is a terrible whining noise and the warning light comes on that the transmission fluid is overheating. I stop the Jeep, let it cool down and it is fine until the next time. We took it to the dealer and they couldn't find anything wrong, so they recommended changing the fluid. We had that done 2 days ago, paid 320.00 for it, and thought it was OK. 
      Today, on my way home from work (35 miles of highway driving) every warning light on the dash began flashing and an alarm was sounding. I pulled over and shut it down. After about 20 minutes, I started it up again. No lights will come on except the radio and clock. It won't move out of park. The power windows work, but the power locks won't.

"I brought my 2007 Jeep Commander with a 4.7 V8 into Cherokee Chrysler for a tune-up and was told that I had a warped head that needed to be replaced. I was told that Chrysler would not stand behind their 5 year/100,000 warranty because I was 5k outside of the warranty mileage, but that if I was the original owner, Chrysler would have. What difference does it make if I am the first owner? I then waited for 3 weeks being constantly told that parts were on order and the dealership could not tell me when the parts would be in or when the car would be ready. I was so mad by that time that I had the car towed to a local mechanic who had the issue repaired in a week. He told me that Chrysler knows there is an inherent design flaw in that motor's head and gaskets and has since been redesigned in the latest vehicles because of this.
      This is inexcusable treatment by a an elite southeastern region dealership! One of two things is wrong here. Either Chrysler needs to support the cars they sell and have parts available for service or the dealership needs to work harder to find them. To add insult to injury, because of the way that my vehicle was stored, the battery ran down and had to be replaced. So to add to the $3K bill, l had to pay a 5% ** tax because the dealership was careless.",1.0
"I bought a Jeep Cherokee from a Zimbabwean friend who left for Australia. The Jeep was well looked after and in very good shape, it had about 90,000km. Since I bought it, this vehicle started giving me lots of trouble and it cost me a fortune to have it fixed. Now the car has 225,000km and the series of troubles just continue. If it's not a problem with the steering, then it's the air conditioner or the fuel injection or whatever you can imagine. I could make a very long list of all the problems that happened since I bought it. 
      For some administrative reason, I can not sell the vehicle and I don't want to keep it in the garage as ""decoration"", so I continue driving it and it continues to cause costs and aggravation. One thing is for sure, I would never ever buy a Chrysler Jeep again. Whoever is interested in the kind of problems I had is welcome to send me an email and respond with details.",1.0
"My seven-year old Jeep Cherokee (only had it for two) suddenly vomited loads of oil all over my drive without warning when I started it up last week. It went into garage and they said it was a leak from the front crankshaft seal. They replaced seal and then saw it needed new timing belt. Then they were about to deliver it back to me and contacted to say that the seal had blown again (oil everywhere once again).
      It has apparently got end play in the crankshaft thrust bearing causing the problem. My jeep is still now 'in hospital' and I do not know what to do. Jeep locally says it's better to have a new engine at a cost without labor. That is more than I bought the car for two years ago (with three months warranty from dealer). My garage is going to try and see if they can fix the problem, take engine out, etc, etc. God knows what the bill is already and God knows what the bill will finally be. That is if indeed they can fix it. Imagine me having a big fat bill for a car that is a write off.What I need to know is surely this kind of thing shouldn't happen to a jeep of seven years, so not too old and only 59,000 miles on the clock. And I have looked after her and, only one owner before, etc. Surely, this is a fault in the manufacturing and fitting of engine parts.

"This is the 2nd time I have had a short in the door of my 04 jeep Cherokee Larado. Lights won't shut off, messages that aren't true window won't work half the time. Jeep should have a recall as I have read many complaints for the same thing. Pay to have my jeep fixed. Sue jeep and then they might fix it.",1.0
"I took my 1998 Jeep Cherokee to Jeep in White Plains, New York. My jeep was stalling sometimes on the highway going 50 miles per hour most of the time at a light, a stop sign or in slow traffic. Sometimes the car would work with no problems for couple days. After a while, the problem happened more and more. Sometimes the car would not start for five minutes after stalling; the car would always start again after a few minutes at most. Many times, my wife or I would stall in very unsafe conditions; luckily no serious problems have happened as a result yet.
      I took the car to Jeep who charged me approximately $250 to tell me that I need $5000 worth of repair. The jeep is worth about $1800 as a trade in (149k miles). I took the car to a local mechanic, who said he could replace the computer. After that $1000 spent, I then was told I needed a new ignition coil, crankshaft, PCM and a new exhaust because not only did the jeep continue to stall, but now it would backfire insanely loud, which blew my muffler apart twice. It still continues to intermittently stalls, sputters, and backfires. I looked online and found thousands of jeep owners describing the same problem with 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee with either Jeep or a local mechanic doing all the repairs I described, and like me none of which solved the problem.I dug a little further on the web; I found instructions to fix this, which seemed too good to be true. It said to use either smaller screws or add three washers to each screw on the PCM (power control module). It is because they claim the screws are too long and they short out on the circuit board. The instructions also described cleaning the connectors to the PCM with a silicone compound and component cleaner, and then apply six twenty-four inches plastic tie stripes around the connection. I applied this fix; as soon as I did it, it was like night and day. The jeep no longer has the problems it had. No more stalling, sputtering, backfiring and running rough. The jeep feels like new. Many other users on the Internet either gave up or had success with the same fix which costs less than $20.Jeep should be ashamed, and should take care of this problem. If Jeep cares about this customer or any customer, they should immediately take responsibly, and provide a serious manufacturer authorized fix; especially in these times when many people seemed to have less trust in American cars-- shame on you Jeep. I will tell everyone I know about this.",1.0
"I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty.  While under the original warranty, I have had the front door windows replaced twice.  Out of warranty, I have replaced the front window a second time and the rear windows a total of three times.  The last repair of the rear window was done with the improved part (which also required that I purchase a new window).  
      Last week, both rear windows failed again (yes, one of the failed windows was the one with the improved part installed).  This will now be the seventh and eighth time that I have had to repair the windows on this car.  The last repair was a no cost repair as I was able to get Jeep to reimburse me for the cost of the new parts, but they would not reimburse me for the previous three repairs.There are tens of thousands of people with this exact problem.  Why doesn't Jeep issue a recall?  This makes me never want to buy another Jeep product.  I thought about buying a Cherokee but changed my mind and bought a Ford Escape.  Not a single problem with it!",1.0

"I bought my 2003 Jeep Cherokee from a used car dealer.  Hours after pulling off the lot, the driver side tail light was blown.  A little mad, I replaced the bulb and went on with my life.  Four years later, I have replaced the bulb socket four times.  It is blown again.  I have been watching other Jeeps and now see this is a major flaw in the vehicle because hundreds of Jeeps have the same light blown.  They need to have this recalled and fixed before someone gets pulled over on an occasion they would rather not be in.  I have been pulled over in the middle of the night after coming home from work which is at local bars.  I have been harassed, given DUI tests and had my vehicle searched for an hour simply for having a light on at the wrong time.",
"I have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport. I have had it since it had 33 miles on it. Currently it has well over 136,000 miles. It has traveled up and down the East Coast, as well traveling to and from Colorado. I love my Jeep and I have always wanted to do the servicing myself. However, I never had the time to do so. It all started when I began to take off from a slopped driveway. The engine would sputter a slight stall but then regain. This went on for months without knowing what to do. I have taken it to several shops, friends and other co-workers trying to figure it all out. Lo and behold, I finally figured out what the problem was. 
      The problem was only found after flushing the radiator, changing the oil, changing the spark plugs, and spark plug wires, checking each and every fuse in the vehicle. I even purchased a Hayes to help me out, no offense Hayes but that wasn't an easy read. I am a novice. The stalling had gotten so bad that on a busy highway, the Jeep just stopped running. The motion continued, but the Jeep stalled itself out. I even tried seeing if it had water in the gas tank. I added fuel additives which seemed to help, but not really.What I had found out that it was the ""crank-shaft position sensor"" I may have the terms off/wrong, but it is a sensor that changed my Jeep's attitude. However, just be sure that when you purchase the $85.00 sensor from Auto Zone, make sure that there is enough wire to make it and still clasp into location on top of the block. It took me 7 hours to figure out that I needed a 12"" extension on the rachet and a universal jointed socket to finally get the two (2) tiny bolts out of the bell housing. After that, it was a quick click and tighten the bolts. All's well with the world once again. I don't really have anyone to complain about, I just wanted to share my experience with everyone out there.",
"I purchased a 2004 Jeep Liberty. It doesn't even have 90,000 miles yet, and I am already needing a whole new transmission. What is this? Shouldn't Jeep make their vehicles last a bit longer, before such a huge repair? I am a stay at home mom and I don't drive anywhere, but to the store and back (no long travels), and I have to deal with this already. I was thinking of trading my Liberty in for the new Cherokee, but after this, I don't think I'll ever want to own another Jeep. This is just ridiculous!",

"Well, after purchasing a $16 thousand plus vehicle, it has been one dilemma or another. First, the headlight started flickering, and the inside dashboard just as well then turn off automatically. I took it the shop to get it fixed. Then I had a neighboring dealership next door fix it. What is that about? Then my husband bought tires for the vehicle, so when it had to align, a certain bolt had broken because it was rusty and old. 
      Now, my vehicle is having a break problem or a tire pressure problem. i think one thing lead to another. My husband bought a scanner, so it said right tire sensor pressure problem that is actually affecting the front break to lock. i searched the whole ABS sensor issues for my 2006 grand jeep Cherokee. I come to find out that I'm not the only one with this issue and that this is manufacturer issue. Light going off automatically can cause an accident, and personally there is an electrical defect with ABS sensor that can cost consumer a lot of money for something that a manufacturer seem to ignore and car dealership just as well.",

"In February, my 2006 Jeep G Cherokee Laredo began to act as though it was going to stall. I took it into the shop to be fixed. In April, it began to stall when I was breaking or slowing down to make a turn. It would stall before cranking up. I took it in then also, I was told that it was possibly the transmission and that I was going to have to pay to get it fixed. I have since then found out that this has not only been happening to me, but to other people, and it is a recall - but not for the 2006 Jeep. I was headed home today, May 9, 2006, and on the Highway FL Turnpike. All of a sudden, my Jeep stalled and would not crank. I almost got hit by a truck.",

"I have owned a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport for the past 7 years and have been having problems for the last 1 1/2 years. When I drive my vehicle and have to make more than a couple of stops, it dies without warning. I have to wait an average of 20-30 minutes before the vehicle will restart. I have been lucky enough to have this happen in places where I am able to be out of the way of traffic but I fear that I will not always be so lucky and cause an accident or be hit by another vehicle. All of my gauges continue to read normal during this. Are there any similar problems like this with other Jeep owners?",
"To sum things up I had a similar issue with an 89' Cherokee Laredo as Jamie of Nipomo CA (10/28/08). The experience was really asking questions of dealers and mechanics and getting their ideas as to what the possible causes were of rough idles and stalling. None of them came up with the most common cause for either case scenarios at all... So with a lil work on my behalf found that the temp sensor is often a cause of such issues, a twelve dollar part that they never told me about. They said everything from the iacv, map sensor, ignition system and such...",

She was able to pull off the side of the road and it did restart. This has happened a couple of time in the past week. We had a diagnostic test which shows nothing wrong. I see there has been a recall for the same problem, but on newer models. I really believe the older models such as the one we have is also having the very same problem. Hopefully the recall will be issued for older models as well as a search on the internet shows MANY with the same problem on older models. Thank you.",
I have a 2004 Jeep Cherokee. The driver's window regulator has gone out 3 times and each of my back window regulators have gone out. The first time it went out it was covered under warranty but I have had to pay for the other repairs. The regulator/motor piece cost $275 plus labor. This is ridiculous. Jeep needs to do a recall on this as I have heard from many other Jeep owners that they have the same problem and it does not seem Chrysler is willing to help.,

"My uncle Paulino went to this shop to get a diagnosis on a problem he faced with his 1998 Jeep Cherokee on 8-11-08. An hour later a gentleman named Cesar, told him that the transmission needed replacement and that it would cost him $1,200. My uncle said, if that's the problem than they can go ahead and start the process of repairing it. Cesar did not print out a contract, nor did he take down my uncles information, he just asked my uncle to leave it at the shop. 8-12-08 afternoon, my uncle went to the shop after work to check up on his vehicle. Cesar said that they could not work on the vehicle at his shop (where my uncle left the vehicle), so they took it elsewhere. My uncle said, where exactly is it and why did you not ask for my permission? Cesar said uhm, well its in a shop in Santa Monica. My uncle asked to please give him the address so he can take the bus to check on his car. Cesar gave him an address and so my uncle took a 30 minute bus ride to the Santa Monica Shop. The shop owner said we don't know what your talking about? My uncle went back to the the original shop, told Cesar that he did not want to do business with him and to return the vehicle. Cesar said, we are already working on your car, there is nothing I can do. 
      My uncle asked for his vehicle, Cesar called his boss, the boss did not pick up his cell phone. Cesar never returned the vehicle to my uncle or provided information to where the vehicle was located. 8-12-08 My uncle will contact the Police Department to accompany him to the shop in case there is a civil dispute.My uncle does not know if his vehicle will be returned with damages, if the vehicle was handles by a licensed technician and if he will be charged for unauthorized work.",

      The anti-theft device does not recognize the key.  The anti-theft devices stops the flow of gas to the car.  This just happens every 2 weeks. I have had it towed three times at $75.00 per tow.  What am I going to do?",
"I'm very disgusted with the service I received at Jeep 17.  I purchased a certified 2005 Jeep Grande Cherokee with 41,000 miles around October/November 2007. The sales rep was very nice at the time and said they'll take care of any problems within a three month period. I loved the Jeep and it came with a Power train warranty and a three month bumper to bumper warranty.  Well, within the three months many problems would start to occur.
      When I  hit any sized bump or hole the back hatch would make a clicking sound.  When I brought it to the service department, they claimed that the clicking sound was due to the back shocks being worn down.  They replaced the shocks but the next day I realized the hatch was still making the noise.  I brought my truck back due to their error and told one of the service managers that they told me the shocks were the reason for the noise. He said ""why would it be the shocks?"" and then said it's because of the locking mechanism. I made another appointment to get this issue fixed. They would attempt to fix this problem again with no success. Still to this day, the back hatch makes a noise after two parts were replaced.  I made many long trips going back and forth trying to get the issue resolved because I would drop it off the night before and pick it up the next day.   When I brought the truck back for the hatch problem, I said to the service department that both remote keys were also not working on a constant basis. They took my keys and reprogrammed them.  This method also failed.  My truck has an alarm system and when I don't use the remote key it goes off.  So every, afternoon, and night I set my car alarm off because I have to use the key to enter my vehicle. I brought both my keys in to be looked at but since they did not record the problem in their computer they also refuse to provide me with new keys.  The service manger said that one key should last 40,000 miles. Since my truck only has 40,000 miles, I should have one key that is new.  My last complaint is that my truck sputters from time to time. (When I step on the gas pedal it would feel as if the car was stuttering) Jeep checked out the sputtering and said ""they didn't know what the problem was because the check engine light did not come on."" After the three month warranty period ended, the check engine light went on and when they looked at the readings they claimed it was the transmission modulator. One of the signs of the part going bad was a form a sputtering. I explained to them this was a preexisting problem that occurred within the three months but they refused to fix the problem under the warranty.  They refused it even though it's documented that I took it in for that particular problem.  All three of these issues were brought to them within the three month bumper to bumper warranty. I strongly feel I should be compensated for the time I spent going back and forth, for jeep not honoring the warranty and for the hatch not being replaced properly. In addition the starter went bad just after the three month period. When I purchased this vehicle I was told that if any problems occur within the warranty they would replace it happily.  Well that's not the case.  They have failed to honor their warranty and it seems like they waited for the three months to end before they corrected the problem properly.",
"I have a 2001 Jeep Cherokee that is taking all my money. At 90,000 miles the truck started surging at all speeds. I have replaced the spark plugs 2x, whole a/c system, transmission filter and fluid, fuel pump and filters, had a smoke test done looking for any possible vacuum or emission leak. I just don't understand how this is a common problem with Jeep and there is no recall for this. I read that someone has placed a sign in the window of there Jeep that reads (( lemon )). I get so angry when I keep getting screwed and there is nothing I can do about it. Well, I'm gonna put a lemon sign in my windows too............",
"I have replaced 3 Window regulators in my 2001 Jeep Cherokee within the past 2 years, each costing me from $250 to $330.  I have talked with Chrysler about this issue and they are aware of the bad design but are not going to help me pay for the next window regulator. One time when my window regulator went out it was raining and I was on my way taking my family to the movies. The window slid down right when a truck was passing by soaking my daughter getting her all wet and muddy.  I feel Chrysler needs to do a recall before someone gets seriously injured.",

"In October 2006 my fan blade on my jeep Cherokee 2000 fractured and also damaged the shell around the blade.  My car was purchased in the states, but has been with me in Mexico since 2006 (I am a US citizen, but currently a medical student in Guadalajara, Mexico).  I took it to a Jeep dealership here b/c I was certain that it would be fixed appropriately.  A month later I received a notice at my mailing address in the states reporting a recall on the fan blades etc.  I called the number on the recall notice and was directed to call an international Jeep number for reimbursement.  
      Needless to say, all I got was a voice automated system with no way to leave a message or talk with in actual person.  Therefore, I went to the Jeep dealership here in Mexico to address this issue in person.  I was told that the fan blade itself in which I was charged $5000 pesos/ $500 USD was now only $200 and that they couldn't reimburse me b/c the recall notice was from the states and that what they fixed was not what the recall covered. I don't know much about cars, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that the fan blade broke and that was what was clearly defined on the recall.  I am very frustrated  with the Mexican dealership and the lack of guidance from  customer service reps in the states.  I took it to a Jeep dealership b/c I had assumed that it's corporation functioned on an international system. In addition, I felt as though I was originally the charged the gringa price.  It does not help to be blond hair, blue eyes and American and trying to negotiate in a foreign country.  So now I am stuck with a bill of $10,266.39 pesos and no solution nor direction for reimbursement.  I have been a jeep owner since 1999 and I swore by their reputation.  I can handle when things break or things are recalled, but the lack of assistance will probably prevent me from ever purchasing another jeep again.",
"I purchased a 2001 jeep grande Cherokee certified preowned with @ 15,000 miles. The only thing positive about this purchase was the comfortable ride and the color. After about of month of driving the engine light went on only to find there was a cracked cylinder head. I complained to the dealer and questioned why would something like this would happen and they seemed unconcerned stating it was JUST a faulty part. That was the beginning of many other inconveniences and unsafe faulty parts of this costly purchase. There was a transmission problem, gas cap had to be replaced but first it had to be diagnosed which was added into the bill. 
      Then there were brake problems,the heater stopped working, the drivers side window fell down and to top it off driving home from a friends house along a river @ 10:00pm my car just stopped and steering was difficult. I was stranded on the side of the rode(being a female this was slightly dangerous) My car was taken away on a flatbed again inconvenienced without a vehicle until this problem was solved. I was told the crank sensor had gone bad. That was the final straw for me. Being a single working woman I wanted something safer and more dependable. I traded in my vehicle(didn't feel comfortable selling vehicle on my own to anyone else because I would talk them out of buying it from me) not too long after last incident and purchased a Toyota!",
"I owned a 1998 Jeep Cherokee. Within the past year, I have replaced both window regulators, left rear break fixed x 2 and a radiator ($700). Doesn't seem like much, but that was just to keep it running until I could trade it in. The front end had the death wobble so many describe. What is that anyway? It has a clicking sound in the left rear break, again. The rear end had that roar so many have described as well. It needed a new heater coil and air conditioning unit as well. Just minor stuff, right Jeep? The auto repair shop said it was falling apart at the seams. 
      I'd be driving down the road, hit a bump (just a small one), and the front end would bounce off the road. The only way to correct it was to come to a complete stop and go on my way again. It was happening more and more frequently. The day I traded it in, it happened 6 times. I am a nurse, I can't be in an accident because Jeep doesn't make the quality vehicle it used to. I don't have the money to be nickeled and dimed to death either. If doctors did surgery the way Jeep makes parts, every patient in the world would have an attorney on speed dial. I'm rid of the money pit, but in debt up to my eyeballs because I couldn't take the risk with my own safety. It wasn't going to be long before I bounced into another lane and hit someone or got hit. The consequences of either would be tragic at best. Good luck to you continued Jeep owners. I hope you get out soon, for your own safety.",
"2004 Jeep Cherokee stalling problems at all speeds. I took the car into Riverside Jeep (California) 10-31-2007 and paid 336.00 for a new IAC motor and cleaning of the Throttle body.  This did not fix the problem, for the next day, the car started stalling again.  Since then, I have not been able to drive the vehicle and have waited 2 weeks to take it back in since money has been tight.  I have looked online and noticed that there is a sensor switch for the crankshaft that was recalled.  I am upset since I have already paid 336.00 for an IAC motor when that obviously was not the problem.  I'm taking it back in today, and can only hope it is not another expensive visit.  My car only has 45,000 on it and it has been maintained the entire life of the vehicle.  I will never buy a jeep again.",

"I purchased a 2002 Grand Jeep Cherokee from Automax in Broken Arrow, OK which only had 61,000 miles. I ran a NADA vehicle history report prior to that.  I was the second owner. I spoke to Chris at the customer assistance department for Jeep prior to the purchase. I got that number from the Officila Jeep Website.  He said the this car had a 70,000 drive train Warranty and was still under warranty. He said I did not have to do anything to transfer it, that warranties go with the car not the person. In two months the check engine light started coming on. Automax replaced gas cap. It stopped for a while. In May 2007 the transmissions stopped while my husband was on the highway, which was dangerous.  
      When I took the car to Chris Nickle Jeep in Broken Arrow, OK to have it repaired the Service Manager said it had only a 36,000 mile warranty. I took to to the original seller Crown Motors of Tulsa, they said the same thing. They are a Jeep dealer and servicer. Chris Nickle Jeep said the valve body plate in the transmission had broke. It now is leaking transmission fluid.  I called Chrysler Jeep customer service and was told that they saw the notes that I spoke to Chris in March and he told me the car was under a drive train warranty, but they said he was wrong and said they were sorry. I e-mailed customerassist@daimlerchrysler.com and asked for assistance.  I received a response from Lyndsay at the Senior Staff customer Assistance Center which said your request for consideration must be declined, the vehicle only had a 3 year 36,000 mile warranty.  This was during the merger of DaimlerChryler with a Grman company.   The Official Jeep Website Warranty information states What is different from your 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty to the new Chrysler Lifetime Powertrain Warranty?  A11: The 7/70 warranty included a deductible per repair visit, and coverage was transferable for a fee of $150. The new lifetime warranty has no deductible and is not transferable.   Crown Auto Service manager who is a Jeep dealer said the warranty was not transferable. Chris Nickels Service department and ChryslerDaimer say the warranty is not transferable, even though I am the second owner.  If Chrysler had told me this car had no warranty when I called prior to purchase I would have at least purchased an extended one.    I ran a Car Fax in May report on top on the NADA report I already had, and the CarFax report says that the Warranty is transferable at a cost of $150.00. Car Fax shows they get there information from J&L Warranty Pros.  The power steering now is leaking badly.  I obviously purchased a lemon. Oklahoma has no Lemon Laws for used cars.    I have owned a 1989 Jeep Cherokee with 250,000 miles, a 1996 Jeep cherokee that had 127,000 prior it being stuck by someone illegally turning left, and never had this kind of problems.

I have left this truck off the road for at least 10 months out of the last year and 1/2 due to the inability of many local dealers not being able to find the problem and spending over $3,000.00 in other repairs that never corrected this problem.  
      The one Jeep  dealership that found the claimed sensor problem charged another $400.00 for replacing the sensor only to drive it out of the lot and the very next morning have it stalled again. I called the Chrysler company complaint center and they ask that I bring the Jeep back for the dealer to take their time to review the problem once again. They offered no real solution or a loaner of any kind while they kept the truck to review the problem.  In addition to this I have also experienced the chassy bolts coming off as I am driving and the truck wheels splitting and leaving me stranded.  This in addition to the problem above has left me with such a fear of driving the truck that I actually prefer to pay for a taxi to drive 10 minutes to my job than to get into the truck even after we make the repairs.",
"At the end of April I leased a '07 Jeep Cherokee. The sticker listed the mileage as 17/21. I told them that my wife and I do primarily local suburban driving and can I expect 17mpg. Honestly, the sales person said probably a little less. However, after driving the vehicle for 2,300 miles We are averaging approx 9-10 mpg. (with the A/C).
      I'm a 68 year old Senior Citizen and never expected almost the double costs involved for gasoline and the inconvenience of going to the gas station almost twice as many times. I am constantly irritated and I find myself limiting the use of the vehicle and deriving no enjoyment from it. In my mind there was mis-representation by the manufacturer and their dealer. I would appreciate a response.",
"In late Dec 2006 I brought my 2006 Jeep gran Cherokee to the nearest jeep dealership to my home. This was not however the dealership I purchased the automobile from. Regardless the jeep was having a rattling coming from the undercarriage so the Loell dealership took a look and told me that it was the catalytic converter and the cost to replace this part was an estimated $1,000. bear in mind this was the week of Christmas and I was given the news over the phone while I was literally diving in my Aunts funeral procession. 
      I thought that the $1,000. was outrageous since the jeep was just a few months old and I do no off road driving.When I explained to Brian (Service Consultant)that I would bring the jeep to be looked at,at Sudbay- the dealership which I had bought the car from I was told I would need to pay the $1,000 for the part that had been ordered even if I didn't have the replacement done. just yesterday I went back to Sudbay to have the car looked at the the muffler needed to be replaced. this was a part that was covered under warranty. I want to comend Ron the gold team manager @ Glouchester, Ma Sudbay Jeep dealership. and At the same time complain about the service and lies that I was told at a terribly emotional time from the Lowell Ma. dealership. They should truly be ashamed of themselves, their tactics and their business ethics.",
"I own a 2005 Jeep Cherokee, in the last couple of months, when I have the defroster on, Extreme heat pours out on the floor, making it impossible to drive for any length of time. Even if the temperature control is set on a cooler setting, very hot air gets sent to the floor. While air coming out of the defroster is cooler. 2 different dealerships keep telling me that this is normal. How can being uncomfortable driving my vehicle be normal. Please help.",
"I own a 2001 Jeep Cherokee and am having ongoing transmission problems. The first was back in 2005 at 63k miles, the transmission would not shift into gear. I took it to the Jeep Dealer; the technician diagnosed it with a faulty governor & transducer selonoid which was repaired.  Now at 87K miles I am having the same problem.  When I took it to the dealer and explained the problem, the Service Manager did not seem surprised.  
      He said, we are having a lot of problems with transmissions & window regulators.  Needless to say, my car remains in the shop with no end in sight. I now have to rent a car in order to get back and forth to work.   Speaking of window regulators, I had to replace both driver & passenger regulators back in 2005. They both broke about one month apart costing me $375.00 each window.  I contacted the Chrysler Cooperate office at 800-992-1997 on 01/22/07, spoke with customer service representative and explained the above.  The female was very nice, asked me what I would like for Chrysler to do. I requested reimbursement for out of pocket expense such as warranty deductible and or partial reimbursement for the window regulators. The woman apologized and stated there is no record of their product having this problem and that there is nothing they can do.  Ultimately I am left with a 30 thousand dollar lemon.  I do not recommend nor will I buy another Chrysler product.",
"My wife took her '02 Jeep Cherokee in for service because of overheating.  Arriving at the dealer for service, she was informed that the fan had been recalled and would be replaced due to the recall. After the dealer replaced the fan, my wife left the dealer and drove home.  At home, I looked at the service report and noticed that service tech noted in comments there is a possibility that the cooling fan relay is also not working properly, if it quits again may have to replace that relay.....The next morning on the work, my wife called to let me know that the cooling light came on and would not go out.  I called the service dealer and told him about the light coming on and question the service report.  Service tech said it could be the fluid not being filled enough and should have been topped off the day before while serviceing (oil change & recall).  He ALSO STATED that the problem with the fan could cause the relay to go out as well but is not covered under the recall and would cost between $180 to $300 because the bumper has to be removed.  My concern is, IF SOMETHING IS RECALLED, why would the parts that coincide not be replaced as well.  In this case the relay tells the fan when to cut on/off.",
I just had an accident last Saturday. I was already at a parking lot when sudden the car acelerated without control and crashed agains the wall. I don't know if the car is totaled yet but the air bag did not open and I had my daugther in the back seat with a seatbelt. I'm waiting for my insurance to see the car and then after I will contact my lawyer to file a formal complaint.

"I have been a Wrangler owner for decades. I've modified mine over the years, and spent almost $75,000 in total on my newest, a 2018. I've been a fan and ""recommender"" the whole time. But I've never really had an issue before, so I never knew how truly awful Jeep is. My Wrangler is rusting horribly at all the hinges on all four doors, and on the bottoms of the doors and a spot or two on the hood. It's awful, bubbly paint and my wrangler looks like it has acne. Or cancer. It's been in the shop for recalls and other standard care, and each time the service department of my local dealer was going to report it. It's not safe to assume they never did, as I finally called Jeep myself. 
      My first call ended in the rep telling me that I was 30 days too late for the work to be covered. It could NOT be more obvious that this bubbling paint has been going on for over a year, but now I'm ""too late."" If Jeep had done their job, I wouldn't be in this situation. I attempted to escalate the issue, but no one returned calls. I must've made 20 calls and spent HOURS on hold, repeated the story dozens of times to different reps during that 30 day period. I got apology after apology and admission that they dropped the ball. But they still aren't covering it. They estimate my cost to be between 4 and 6 thousand dollars. They admitted on the phone that the reason they're denying it is because it's such an expensive repair. That they'd stand behind the car if it wasn't so costly. They've admitted that this is a known problem. Yet still not covering it. WOW. Have they lost a life-long customer. And I'm going to spend as much time as I can on my Jeep forums and social media spreading the word. This is such a slap in the face. But it does give me the excuse to switch over to the Bronco now. Maybe Ford will be better to their loyal customers.",1.0
"Jeep has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. On December 4, 2023, I made a deal to purchase a brand new Wrangler Willys from a dealership even though this vehicle had some extra features that I did not initially intend to buy. One of these features was a Uconnect 4C NAV & sound group. After picking up my Jeep and driving for only for about 20 minutes, I realized that the Navigation was not working. I did not pay much attention to this, thinking I just needed to sync it when I got home. However, after getting home and trying to sync and reset the Navigation, it still was not working.
      I called Jeep Chrysler customer care. The support person who answered the phone explained how to reset the Nav but their advice did not work. I was then advised to go to the nearest Jeep service. At my servicing appointment, it was determined that the entire radio unit in my Jeep was broken and had to be replaced. The Jeep dealership ordered a new radio. However, the service workers informed me that they could not complete my radio replacement without permission from Jeep customer care and that I would have to open a case regarding this. The service workers called the dealership where I purchased my Jeep. I was told over the phone that my radio was most likely wrongly installed when the vehicle was in the factory and this was not the first time this had happened.Three days later, I finally managed to get through to Jeep customer care over the phone and I received a case number. It has been a month and I still cannot reach the case manager assigned to my case using the number provided to me by Jeep customer care. I have called every day and the call always goes to voicemail. Despite leaving three messages, I have never been called back. I have even tried calling other Jeep departments who have tried to connect me to my case manager with no luck. These departments have also sent emails to my case manager but I have still not received a single response. The navigation system, SOS call and road assistance in my new Jeep are completely broken, I have received no help, and I still have no idea what is happening with my case. This is unacceptable.I am extremely disappointed in the horrendous customer service I have received. I paid for a brand new Jeep and paid more for its extra features, including the Uconnect 4C NAV & sound group. It is this feature that is not working, so I pretty much spent money for nothing. I was so excited about having a Jeep but now this became just a huge headache. Jeep has not taken any action to replace the faulty radio and their customer service exists only on paper. It seems that Jeep and Stellantis unfortunately just care about taking all your money without providing the quality service they claim to offer. I hope my story can help other potential customers think twice before purchasing a Jeep.",1.0
"We purchased a brand new 2023 Jeep Rubicon 3.6 Litre Engine which started leaking oil at 1200 miles. Took vehicle to dealership McKinney Jeep and was told it was a defect from Jeep on the assembly line. A brand new Jeep should not need a new block at 1200 miles. While our Jeep was laid up they gave us a crap Jeep to use but was told not to take out of state. Jeep does not want to compensate us anything for our time and expenses and keeps blowing us off on phone calls and emails. That being said, that was our first and last Jeep we will ever buy for that kind of money. As far as dealer goes, McKinney Jeep in Easly, SC screwed us too in that they had the new block and it sat out back for 2 weeks with nobody to put it in.
      Finally got Jeep back with oil leak and antifreeze smell. Sent it back to dealer again, they had spilled oil and antifreeze on top of engine. They kept it another two days and when i got it back I noticed two weeks later that they had scratched up my driver's seat and they are putting the blame on me and refuse to fix it. Don’t buy a Jeep and certainly not from McKinney Jeep in Easly SC.",1.0

"I bought my Jeep Wrangler in 2020, man I was in love with this car. I felt it was a good drive, sporty, I was so happy for the first 6 month. One day about 6 months after I was coming back from a work trip to LA and I hit a very small bump. I was going about 60 mph and my car started to shake, it was so bad I thought my car was going to come apart on Freeway. I'm not try to be funny but I actually peed my shorts. I was almost hit by 18 wheeler. I managed to get over to side of freeway where I sat for a 1/2 hour. I got off the freeway and called a good friend and asked what I should and he said call the dealer. 
      I called Crystal Cathedral Chrysler and the woman in repairs said, ""Oh that's called the Death Wobble, bring it in and we will repair it."" She said, ""It's ok to drive, just drive in the slow lane."" Well I brought it back 3 times in 3 years to have the ""Death Wobble"" fixed, It's good for about 3 months. I don't take it on the Freeway anymore. My lease is up in 5 months and I can't wait to turn it in. MY buddy has the truck version of my car and no problems.",1.0
"I have NEVER in my 65 years had SUCH poor service. Service Manager HAD NO IDEA how a Hybrid Jeep Wrangler even works. Short history: my Jeep constantly loses its ability to run in electric mode. However, EVERY TIME I take it back to the dealership, I'm told the car is fine. NO IT'S NOT. It's an electric vehicle that WILL NOT RUN IN ELECTRIC MODE. They 100% ignore the error message ""Electric Mode Temporarily Unavailable. Fuel & Oil Refresh In Progress"" Reading the manual, this is a safety mode. IF the preset self diagnostic (Fuel & Oil Refresh) can not complete its diagnosis, the car will disable the electrical ability and only run in gas mode. YET, still no fix.. 
      I spend $85 a day in rental which is not covered... they could care LESS. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT purchase a JEEP. READ all the comments JEEP could care LESS!!!

I had to wait around for the for the roadside assistance that came with my car after putting $7000 down with a $575 monthly payment to lease which is a little bit ridiculous but I love the car. I wish I would've never done it. The worst mistake of my life. I'm stuck with a payment. I was saving money to buy the soft top from them that they told me they would charge me $3000 to put a softer top on. I will never ever ever spend another dollar. 
      They took forever to pick up my son. I had to leave. I left my son waiting with the car pulled over, a brand new car. I paid this money And I struggle never to have a problem that's why I pay so much to never be stranded and never have a problem. I guess not only did they pick up the car after a while but then they told my son, ""I'm sorry. I have two people in my tow truck. You can come,"" and left my son stranded somewhere in Farmingdale. Took him two hours to get a friend to find where he was to be picked up. This is unheard of. This is not right at all. This is unacceptable. I regret the day I walked into the Jeep Dealer and I had my son going to buy a wrangler for his birthday for the summer.

"I purchased 2018 Jeep Wrangler on December 2017 with prepaid maintenance package. I have quite few things to tell. First, after purchased the car, went to Livermore California location for oil change few times, the last time I went there, was absolutely NO customer service! I called before I went there. The receptionist said it was ok to come for service, so I drove all the way from Fremont California to Livermore California, you could Google it how far it is. After got there, the man at front door with BAD ATTITUDE, said ”no, I can’t take you!” I said: ”The receptionist says it’s ok to come.” He said: ”I can’t .” I went back to receptionist, she said the system shows it’s ok to do oil changed service. She had confused face to look the man at door. This is total Racist. He just wouldn’t take my car for Service by his control. This shows the management has no communication to each other, on top of let customer take the responsibility.
      At that time, I knew that I have no effort to complain. The company won’t do anything for it, all it is cover their own employee. I decided to change to different dealership for service. Redwood City Jeep at California is the most unprofessional management. It is the most difficult appointment to make for oil change service. Only three a day for waiting services appointment. A lot drop off appointment. I asked the receptionist, ""If I drop off, do you have shuttle for drop me?"" She said no. Which means cause customers money for no reason. I know it’s pandemic, but you CANNOT use this excuse for everything.I rescheduled my appointment with Fremont Jeep California, they have Monday to Friday, 8am-5pm all waiting appointments. Why they don’t use the “pandemic“ as excuse. Same jeep brand different advertisement. Why would let these unprofessional Dealerships to representing JEEP.

"My wife and I purchased a 2017 Wrangler Unlimited Sport brand new from a Jeep dealer in San Diego. Around 11k miles we noticed the vehicle overheating when going up a steady grade and needed to stop several times. We took the vehicle to a dealer since it was under warranty where the thermostat was replaced and the radiator flushed, and the problem was fixed...WRONG. Continued to have overheating problems and back and forth to dealer for repair. The Jeep failed engine test and thought the vehicle would be repaired. 
      Oh no, as the consumer, we were told by corporate level management and the regional master engine tech that the Heep was operating as designed and would overheat under load when going up a grade. Wow, heck of a way to stand by product Anyway, after weeks of arguing with Jeep management and having a mechanical inspection which validated our complaint - the engine block was cracked, and a new engine block was installed. Encountered coolant leak from thermostat housing, which is plastic and took it to a dealer on 08/10/2020. Picked it up on 08/10/2020, and was informed the thermostat was replaced and had to pay $100.00 for the repair (co-pay under warranty). However, I told the service rep that the thermostat had been replaced in 2018, showed the invoice and that the part had less than 10k miles. Just the consumer, still have to pay. The commercials on TV about experiencing a Jeep adventure has been a Heep nightmare for me. Quality and reliability are poor and interior is poor quality. More importantly, customer service and consumer respect is non-existent. The Jeep has the coo guy factor, but merely speaking it is lipstick on a pig. Had a few other mechanical problems. To date, it has under 24k miles and we do not have any confidence in the vehicle to go adventuring. I am looking forward to see the Ford Bronco.",1.0
"My husband bought me a 2018 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon JK in 2019. Since getting it last year I have had intermittent issues with it starting (it won't start, makes no noises but all lights and radio works) and has recently started randomly turning off while I am driving it with no warning or lights. I have had the car to three different Jeep/Chrysler dealerships. I am being told by the last dealership that we took it to, that you can no longer modify anything electronic or electrical on the newer Jeeps because it can cause these types of issues. Mine has an after market Alpine radio (which was recommended by the service manager at the first of the Jeep dealerships I went to) and after market drop down running boards that were on the Jeep when it was purchased. 
      When we purchased the Jeep it was used, but only had 3400 miles on it (still has under 8000 miles). The fact that it was still under the factory warranty was one of the pros for purchasing this particular Jeep. Their recommendation was to remove all after market items from the Jeep! I was told that even after market light bulbs can cause these problems in the newer Wranglers!!! The last dealership even told me that the Jeep Wrangler I have, which has a factory ""off road package"" cannot be used off road without VOIDING THE WARRANTY! They said that the new Jeeps are ""not made to be used off road""!!!I absolutely LOVE my Jeep but I am so disgusted with Chrysler and these dealerships that it makes me literally sick to my stomach!!! I am now faced with the choice of pursuing legal action or going to a performance garage and seeing if they can fix the issue!!! I am so frustrated and disheartened by Jeep. I also worry about my safety since both times the Jeep stopped running it was while driving down the interstate!",1.0

"Stay away from Chrysler Jeep products. Do your research before you buy. Look at all the forums! Steering and components are junk. Mine broke in half going under 20 mph making a turn. Thankfully no severe injuries, my child wasn't in vehicle, no other vehicle involved, and speed wasnt faster or jeep would have flipped. The bolt holding the pitman arm to the steering box broke in half at an angle. Jeep barely has 100k miles on it. No vibration or warning sign. JK Wranglers are all bad about this. Come to find out my jeep has 9 other recalls, none to do with this issue though, although the forums show that there is a very bad issue and all owners had to replace at own expense.
      Won't stand by their product nor give any kind of help. Wreck happened first of April and I just got an email this week with basically 2 sentences saying because I had to go up 1 tire size, (255 - 265) same wheel size (18) and same width ratio, they don't feel it's their fault. Had to contact state attorney general and BBB of Michigan. Waiting on reply. Stay away from jeep and Chrysler products. Should've listened to word of mouth and read forums.

"2016 Jeep Wrangler JKU with 60119 miles at discovery of issues by dealership, Jeep was purchased new from dealer. Chrysler was contacted by dealership and myself to cover maintenance on blown head engine head gaskets following inspection. On 23Feb20 I noticed excessive vapor coming out of my exhaust on my way home, I checked my coolant and oil to see if there were any problems. Finding low coolant levels however it was still within normal range. Not having any other problems or temperature change I parked my car at home. No more than an additional 3 miles were driven. The following day I contacted a dealerships to check for maintenance and was advised to bring it in if drivable. 
      My vehicle was driven to World Jeep in Shrewsberry NJ where it was determined my head gaskets are damaged and a repair was necessary. The dealership recommended the additional replacement of the radiator which Chrysler was informed of and discussed terms for covering the repair of the vehicle as the failure occurred right at warranty. Following the maintenance and repair I drove my vehicle home and submitted the paid bills which a Chrysler rep had discussed for payment. I found the engine was still having a problem with air in the radiator/coolant line and immediately took my vehicle back to the dealership for a coolant purge. During inspection the Chrysler master mechanic noticed the main coolant fan was not operating as expected. The main coolant fan operation was intermittent which would have caused a long term overheating as the root cause failure of the head gasket which was to determined by the Chrysler facility to have been failing over the last 10,000 miles. Chrysler was contacted and approved maintenance as with the other failed items. Following replacement I drove my vehicle home. Attempting to drive it later the next day when I found my vehicle unable to start. I contacted World Jeep again and was able to start my vehicle and drive it to the dealership for maintenance inspection. Dealership found gasket installed was defective, the heater core was clogged unable to provide heat in the cab and the engine had a knocking noise. Chrysler was contacted to recommend course of action which is the replacement of the engine. 10APR20 Chrysler has changed case managers 4 times and has been difficult to receive a response back by myself or the jeep dealership. Chrysler is now refusing to cover any of the work they had previously agreed to help cover and are only willing to assist with 50% of the repair costs of the engine replacement.

DTC's showed P2072 ETC Ice Block; P2110 Forced limited RPM; P2118 Motor Performance and C121C Torgue denied.

"I purchased a 2017 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited in 2017 & haven't regretted it. It rides much smoother than the 2-door & is pretty comfy & spacious inside. The gas mileage isn't too bad; it averages 19 mpg in summer on secondary roads (17.5 mpg in winter) & 23 mpg on highways in summer (18 mpg in winter). The Wrangler is a very stable vehicle with quick response to driver changes. The 4WD is a good feature for driving in snowy weather & unpaved roads (if you go there). 
      Acceleration is great for a vehicle this size & gives other vehicles a run for their money. Stopping distance is short for this vehicle; the brakes really grab & can stop it pretty much on a dime. I didn't get the fancy navigation or radio options (although I did get the Sirius XM package), but I did have the opportunity to use it in a test drive & it's definitely a nice feature if you want it. Jeep has a wide variety of options for this vehicle, from navigation to tow packages, slick colors & luxury interiors. I would definitely recommend this vehicle for anyone looking to have a little fun & experience ""freedom"".",5.0
"For the past year my 2008 Jeep Wrangler has had issues with at times not starting. It would happen intermittently. I purchased this Jeep new from White Plains Jeep Dealership in 2008. I like the truck but have had several issues throughout the years. For the past year I have been dealing with the Jeep on occasion not starting. You would turn the key and nothing as if the battery were dead. I was getting the car started by moving the gear shift to neutral and then moving it back up to the park position and would move the shifter around a bit. After a few more attempts the Jeep would start up like new. I did some research and found that there were hundreds of complaints with this same issue. Many of the complaints stated that they took there Jeep to the dealership or shops and had the battery, alternator and starter changed and still have this issue.
      In my Jeep I have changed the battery recently and Bill Volz' Westchester Jeep dealership changed out my starter. I had the car home for a week and then the issue started again. I took my car back to the Jeep dealership and it has been there two days with no fix in sights. I called Chrysler and got a case number and a case manager to see if they could have a technician coordinate with the mechanic at this dealership and come up with an idea for repair. With hundreds of complaints on line they must know that this is an issue. Chrysler has not had a recall on this issue.Many of the complaints say the problems are with the Transmission Range Sensor, which when it goes bad doesn't send a signal that the car is actually in Park or neutral and won't allow it to start. It has been two days and the Case manager has not called me back. I have called him and left him messages and no response. Never purchase a Chrysler vehicle again. Shame because I love jeeps.",1.0
"2019 Jeep JL list. Pre ignition issues since day 1 and told that they cannot do anything because it's within normal levels, However I have two friends that have the same year Jeep and nothing. Was also told that it's because the transmission gets used to the way I drive so it's my fault essentially. Clunking noises when reversing. Stereo issues screen goes blue from time to time and I lose volume.",1.0
"My 2016 Jeep Wrangler began stalling approximately three months into the lease (it was brand new). I am now 3 1/2 years into the lease and it has happened 8 times. One time lead to a car accident in which I was permanently injured. I have photos of the light that comes on. I brought them to all the service appointments. I was told there is nothing wrong with my car because there is ""no code"" indicating something is wrong.
      It happened again this week, except this time I lost all control over the vehicle. I was basically ice skating across Route 66 in Neptune, New Jersey as cars swerved to avoid me. While I attempted to gain control over my car I watched an 18 wheeler come towards me, unable to stop. I got out of its way seconds before becoming part of its tire. I'M DONE. I am taking it in for service again and if I have to leave with this vehicle I will be starting a class action lawsuit. I am reading about numerous occurrences very similar to mine. If you care to join in a class action lawsuit against this AWFUL company, please e-mail me. **",1.0
The trans in these Jeeps are junk not like the old ones. You're better off getting one from the 1980s and fixing it up. You get one now you're going to have trans issues. You would be better off not buying one unless you like putting trans in every 40k. Got a older one now. No issue. Knock on wood.,1.0
Where do I even start! I purchased my used 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara in 2016 after trading in my 2011 Honda Accord (another mistake). Everything was going well until almost a year into it (April 2017) the transmission went out. I went back to the dealership and was told my warranty had just expired 200 miles. I had the transmission repaired and received a transmission to warranty everything was going fine until May 2018 and the transmission went out AGAIN! This transmission was covered under warranty and everything was free. Besides other minor issues like radio automatically shutting off or whatnot things were fine and now fast forward to May 2019 and the transmission has went out AGAIN for the 3rd TIME! I am so frustrated and over this vehicle. I was told by my repair guy he has heard of numerous issues with Jeep Wranglers and transmissions.,1.0
"Bought a used 2016 black Hardrock Jeep Rubicon with 12,500 miles in January. Ran perfect for a month, no problems in vehicle history report, vehicle was always garaged, excellent condition. A month out of warranty it just quits in parking lot with no warning, will not start, 14,500 miles. Dealer has been trying their best to fix it without success. Dealer contacts Chrysler since they have tried almost everything after a month. Chrysler customer care claims they are trying to get to the bottom of it, I have been calling them every other day. After a month, still no visit from Chrysler to get this vehicle fixed.
      Just a bunch of nonsense over the phone about how it will be fixed, nonsense, after 2 months still no further progress. Totally dissatisfied! I wish I could rate my satisfaction at a ZERO! I previously owned a 2006 Wrangler and my dad has owned multiple Jeep Rubicons, a Liberty and a Wrangler, not to mention a 1947 Willys, and other older Jeeps. Both of us are considering never buying another Chrysler product after this experience. I am very unhappy!",1.0
"My husband and I leased a 2019 Wrangler exactly 2 weeks ago today. The vehicle has 137 miles. Tuesday, the car completely shut down while driving a mile from my house. The car wouldn't turn on at all. After waiting 2 hours for the FCA hired tow truck, I arrived at the dealer to not even get a loaner and told diagnostics needs to happen before they give me a rental.
      Last night, Thursday, I picked up the Jeep and drove home. Just now, I get in the Wrangler and not even a mile from my house the transmission light turns on! This is totally unacceptable for a new vehicle, let alone one with a sticker price of $42k. Even if they bring it back and ""fix"" it, I cannot trust this vehicle to drive out of town. What if I was on the highway and it just shut down? This is not only frustrating but extremely unsafe and truly putting lives at danger. I owned a 2001 Cherokee prior to this, and I'm in shock that the quality of Jeep has plummeted like this.",1.0

Currently I have 10k miles on the Jeep. Only issues so far: 1. Rattling speaker that is back ordered but should be fixed soon. 2. Steering play - I’ve learned to live with it. 3. Off road pages isn’t available yet. I spent more for the 8.4 nav system to get the off road pages program. I’ve been told it will eventually be available. It is frustrating it isn’t available now. Otherwise I love the Jeep. It is great using it to explore Colorado. It’s expensive at $50k but worth it.",5.0
"I don’t really know where to start. The Jeep Wrangler is a really cool vehicle but that’s about it. Problem one, rear armrest doesn’t latch properly. Took to service, I was told they won’t replace it, it’s just new and it’s a Jeep, there’s going to be problems. Second issue on same visit the 8-9” Uconnect audio navigation system audio system is very glitchy, sound fades in and out. Manufacturer says they don’t have a fix, Will in time. Wow a $55,000 vehicle and audio system is broken. Has been months now, no resolution. I decided to take it to another dealer for a second opinion, oh on the way to the dealer the passenger seat belt broke. The second dealer said the same thing, it’s new, it’s a Jeep, problems are going to happen. They ordered the part, that was fixed. I’ve never seen a seat belt break, a very important safety device.
      My confidence in Jeep products are very low at this point based on how I’ve been treated and how they regard their product. I actually chose the Jeep over a reliable 4Runner. It was a very expensive mistake on my part. Hopefully it lasts long enough for the duration of my loan. I’m not sure it will. Don’t buy a Jeep product unless you have an endless supply of money, time, and patience. I’ll post an update when something else breaks.",1.0
"Complaint - In June 25, 2018 I took my 2016 Jeep Wrangler for an ABS light on. This is when the whole ordeal started and hasn’t ended since now. I took my vehicle to Jim Browne Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in Tampa Fl. The service department is PATHETIC. I brought my vehicle in for a code for an abs light on the dash. I met Julie. The worst day of my life. She suggested I needed a tire rotation which I thought was odd as I just purchased 4 new tires and had them rotated but it only cost $22.00 so I told her, ""Ok if you think I need it.""
      Then she starts with an obsession-with a low ticking noise. My Jeep was running great. My husband tells her, ""Let’s not lose focus we know."" She checks her handheld computer and states, ""Oh you don’t have warranty."" I told her I just purchased an extended warranty and she looked at it and say, ""Oh it’s Assurant. I have dealt with them all the time. I will call them and gets the ticking noise and abs light covered under warranty.""I left the vehicle and she calls me back later that afternoon to say, ""I spoke to warranty and they say you will have to pay $400.00 to look at the engine,"" but not to worry, that I won’t have to pay for that. She is sure it would be under the warranty. She then calls me back and say, ""Well the warranty would not cover the engine because they feel it’s preexisting,"" and I asked what about the abs light. She say, ""Oh that’s not covered because they didn’t see the abs light on and they feel it’s preexisting as well."" I told her just put my car back together and I’ll be there to pick it up and take it somewhere else. She calls back a short time and states, ""Oh I’m just calling to tell you that if you want your car put back together you will have to pay an additional 400.00 to get the car put back together."" I asked to speak to her supervisor and I spoke with Justin who adjusted the price and charged me $426.00 for them to look at the engine.Four days later when they were complete I picked up my Jeep Wrangler just to stall out in the highway. I could have died this day as I was traveling at 55mph but GOD was with me. With very hard maneuver I was able to pull to the side of the road and not get hit from the rear. I called the dealership and told them what just happen and I was getting it towed back to them. My first thought is they were upset about not getting the engine work that they didn’t put things back in place as they should have. Or forgot to put oil back in the engine and it locked. But I’m not mechanic. I could smell fumes from burnt oil that came from the hood of the car.I had the vehicle towed back to the dealership and now after they diagnosed it they come back and say it was a starter that went bad. They wanted to get a starter and Justin called me back a few days later to say that the car still won’t start after they placed the starter in it. So they are still working on the vehicle to see what occurred. He did provided a rental and said they will work on it and let me know what happen. A few days later he calls me back and say, ""Well we are going to replace the engine on a goodwill,"" and to bring back the rental and get one of their vehicles until the engine comes in and is replaced. I would have to pay another $500.00 for a warranty and they will cover the rest.The warranty covers 5 years /100,000 miles I was told and if anything goes wrong I can take it to any Jeep dealership. I had to pay for a starter which he say before was not the problem and the warranty. Now I’m up to $1078.00 for a warranty, starter and for the diagnose of ticking noise and my abs light was never repaired. That was the reason for going there from the start.I picked up my Jeep after almost a month and I leave the dealership to experience the vehicle smoking from the hood and fumes of burning oil. I called them back again and Julie stated that the smoke is from burn off period which should go away in a couple of days driving it. I then took my Jeep to Firestone which is on the MacDill AFB military base and the mechanic stated it is an oil leak from the gaskets. He say that doesn’t look like burn off oil. He just looked down where the smoke was coming from and he states, ""I see the drip on the manifold cover.""I then called Justin to explain to him our finding and he suggested I give him the mechanic's name and number that he wants to talk to him. He doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He then calls the Firestone and the mechanic tells him, ""I believe it’s a leak not a burn off period."" So Justin calls me back and states he wasn’t for sure that it was a leak as he did not take the motor apart. He suggested we drive the vehicle for a couple of days and if it’s still smoking bring it back. My husband told him maybe we should just take it to another dealership and he said, ""No. Bring it here."" My husband told him, ""We just don’t trust you anymore.""I drove the vehicle for another 4 hours and it’s started smoking so much into the vehicle as well while I had my grand babies in the vehicle. I then took it to Central Orlando Jeep dealership and he states, ""We can’t look at it because it’s a goodwill warranty from Chrysler."" Now there’s a check engine light on and smoke still coming from the hood. I don’t trust taking my vehicle to Jim Browne Jeep and Chrysler. I’m looking to get rid of the Jeep at this point. The ticking noise is back. Not knowing the condition of my vehicle. I do not feel safe driving this new 2016 Jeep as it smokes in the engine area and ticking noise is back.I took the vehicle back to Jim Browne dealership and they worked on the engine again and after a month they called to tell me the vehicle is ready. I took possession on August 1, 2018 and explained that I was traveling out of state and I want to make sure this Jeep will make it. Justin assured me the engine is fine and it will make it to NJ and back with no issues. In September 2018 as we were driving back from a cruise in South Carolina the Jeep breaks down again. I had it towed now to Hendrick Chrysler Jeep dealership in North Carolina and the service manager say it’s the engine that failed and they would have to look into it further and order parts and talk to someone in the dealership in Tampa as they appeared to not have tightened some part in the engine which caused it to damage the engine. It appears that something in the engine was not tightened and the oil started to leak in the engine again.The dealership took possession of the Jeep and stated they would have to wait for parts to come in from the warehouse. I was given a rental for a month and they were completed September 24th and I took possession of the vehicle. Some more major work was done to the engine. On December 7, 2018 took my Jeep to Central Florida Chrysler dealership for an oil change and was advised that there appear to be an oil leak from the engine again. A further diagnostic should be conducted but that they don’t have the professionals for this type of work. What am I to do now. I have had the worst experience with this Jeep and this engine. I need some type of resolution. If my issues are not resolved you give me no alternative then to file a complaint with the State Attorney General and will report you to the Better Business Bureau.",1.0
"I have had many problems from day one when I bought it. My Jeep is a 2015 Wrangler Sahara Unlimited. First the paint job was very terrible. It's still is. It looks like fish eyes. I had to have them fix it at least twice now. At 21,000 miles give or take was on vacation and then something with the fuel ignitor went literally driving down the road and had to hurry up and pull off. Yes Jeep did take care of it because it was under warranty but the fact that it's 21,000 miles that sucked. I have had the fenders redone because they have cracked. 
      I have also had the seals replaced in the freedom top twice and also on the door driver side. I have never taken the doors off many many leaks. I'm also having problems with my radio. It literally just shuts off and reboots itself. Took it to the dealership to see if they can fix it. The only thing they told me was, ""There's nothing we can do for it except for put about $1,800 into a radio."" It is touch screen has navigation but still $1,800 for a radio. I've also had issues with some wires touching and literally driving down the road have no gas pedal. I was traveling a highway and I could not hit the gas pedal to get out of the way. I was lucky enough to be able to pull over and then I could not start the Jeep. After that had to have it towed to the dealership and of course it was not under warranty anymore because I could not afford to buy the extended warranty and I had to pay out of the pocket. This is my first Jeep that I ever bought and I'm telling you up in three and a half years having the issues that I have had I swear I'll probably never go back and buy any type of Jeep Chrysler Dodge any type of Mopar product. Very very very unhappy with it.",2.0

"Bought new 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport March 2017, check engine light come on 995 miles, transmission wouldn't shift out of 1st gear. Had car in to one dealer 5 times in 12 months, always showed po714 code along with few others, PO714 has to do with transmission. Took back to selling dealer on advice from Jeep CC, they replaced more electrical components, check engine light come on again. Took to 3rd dealership 10 days later, they found rodent damage, basically confirmed it probably had been problem from the get go. Out of pocket $1800 repair with insurance paying $1200, less than 10 days ck engine light again, PO714 ww done again. 12 days later ck engine light again, back to selling dealer with PO714 showing, replaced same module that had been replaced before. 
      Selling dealer GM would not talk to me. JEEP CC was supposed to contact me in 48hrs. It was over 2 weeks when he finally called, I told him I had traded out of Jeep, as I was tired of making $550 payments on something that was not dependable. Now this all transpired in 16 month timeframe with less than 7000 miles. SO as far as I can tell The Lemon Law is useless to the consumer, basically Lemon Law is a JOKE!!",1.0
"I love my Jeep Sport Wrangler. Owning a Jeep is a preference, it rides a little rougher than a car, but I wouldn’t own anything else, it is very versatile in dry weather as well as rain, snow or mud. It is very durable, on and off road, and there is no limit to accessories, other suv's bored me and had nothing to offer as far as having a old fashion rugged look, I wanted to feel comfortable taking it off road and not scared to get it dirty. It would be nice though if my Jeep had leather seats to choose from rather than just cloth, it would be a lot easier to maintain if I could just wipe them clean.",5.0
I love everything about Jeep Wrangler. The color black is great. 5-speed standard transmission and two front bucket seats. Even a little truck with fold down seat. Reclining front seats too.

This was a major improvement to the interior. A few more drink holders would be nice too. A way to hold open the back gate would be a good improvement. But I like the rugged style of the Jeep.

"I purchased a 2018 Jeep JL Rubicon in May of 2018. On July 3, 2018 my wife noted a message on the console while driving that stated she should pull over as the vehicle will shutdown soon. She was only a short ways from home and was able to safely return home with the vehicle. I drove it the next day and had the same problem and it was worse. The vehicle started shutting down, the electrical was going crazy, the 4x4 system started randomly to engage the 4x4 and disconnect the sway bar and engage the lockers. This is very dangerous while driving. I got the Jeep home and called for a tow truck to take it to the dealership on July 4, 2018. The Jeep would not start. It would not go into gear and it started acting crazy and the stereo would even randomly come on at maximum volume. The dealership did everything and tried to find what was wrong. They replaced a module and did a recall on the vehicle. 
      They had the vehicle for 7 days which placed it out of service. On July 15 I had completed washing the vehicle and decided to inspect the frame of the vehicle. On the JL Wrangler forums it had been noted by several other JL owners that the steel frame of the vehicle was rusting around the welds and paint on the frame is flaking off. I checked under my vehicle and found advanced rust around the welds in key areas and that rust is starting at most of the major weld points due to poor welding from the manufacturing process. I am not the only one. This is a well documented issue for several Jeep owners. We have also filed complaints with the NHTSA for this issue as one person while driving with his family had a catastrophic structural failure of the vehicle. On July 20 while driving the Jeep the same electrical issues started again and the message about Stop Immediately and pull over as the Jeep will shutdown soon will happen. Not more than a few seconds later the Jeep started going crazy it lost all power. I almost wrecked. Fiat Chrysler the owners of Jeep have had very poor customer service and have not given my complaints any serious consideration. Jeep has been horrible through this whole experience. I have requested numerous times to have this vehicle returned under the lemon law but they are being obstinant about the entire situation. By far one of the worst vehicles I have ever owned and I am severely disappointed in Jeep AKA Fiat Chrysler.",1.0

"I have a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Sport with 46000 mile. I take it to an oil change place every 3000 mile. I have the paperwork. I took it to get my oil changed. When I got it back I noticed a knock from the engine that it didn't have before. I took it back to the oil change place. The sound was louder. They said it sounded like the lower end of the engine was coming apart and recommended I take it to a Jeep dealer. I had it towed there. They said for 250 dollars they would check it out. They did and said the motor was blowing up. They checked with Jeep with all my oil change paperwork in hand. They said Jeep might cover it. 
      They checked with Jeep and they said, ""nope not covered."" I talked with Jeep Headquarters. They said the same thing. The main guy at Jeep checked to see if he could get a crank and found there was none in the U.S.A. and no aftermarket. He said they would have to replace the complete engine at a cost of 5600 dollars. I talked with Jeep Headquarters again to see if they would help with the cost, again nope. This is my daily driver back and forth to work. Never been out four wheeling. They could tell it's been taken care of.

I have a 2010 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited with a manual transmission. The clutch went out at approximately 52500 miles. I had it replaced and come to find out that I no longer have a 5th gear.

I'm very disappointed that it was slightly out of warranty. I have owned Jeeps for several years now and have never had a problem to this extent. I have read many reviews on the 2010 Jeep regarding the engine and transmission. This year has several complaints.

"I bought a used 07 Wrangler. Worked fine at first. However, I have had multiple issues starting about 6 months after purchase. Continuous electrical issues. Turn signals and brake lights work when they want to. Electrical door lock works when it wants to. The passenger side window does not work anymore. Also, the gear shift bushing had to be replaced several times, we are using a zip tie now and it works better than the bushings. We have had to replace the radiator due to a crack, replaced brakes and pads as well as 2 calipers due to the caliper piston not retracting after releasing the brake. Finally, something I consider a total manufacturing error, the WCM does not work properly. I have original keys but the module does not always recognize my key and will lock me out from starting my vehicle. I have to remove the fuse to reset it in order to start my car. Not happy.

"I bought a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Sport for my son. It was new and had a 5 year 50,000 mile warranty. He meticulously maintained this vehicle. It had a complete engine failure with 3 days left on the warranty and 48,000 miles on the odometer. The dealer had a computer failure and wouldn't take the car in. I had it towed there the next week--they would not honor the warranty because it went out of service over the weekend. I had multiple customer service reps at Jeep that said it would be covered--but when it came down to it--they only covered half--costing me over $2500.00 for a product that failed under warranty. Never, ever buy a Jeep or Chrysler product. THEY WILL NOT DO THE RIGHT THING. I have always tried to buy American--but seriously--that is no longer a concern of mine and please DON'T BUY A JEEP PRODUCT. You will regret it!!!",1.0
"We are the unfortunate owners of a 2013 Jeep wrangler. To put it bluntly, this machine is a hunk of junk!!! We've had nothing but electric problems, sensors crapping out costing loads of money. Wires melting because they're too close to the catalytic converter. Can't wait for this thing to go on fire. One short after another. And we're told it's out of warranty and Chrysler won't do a damn thing. So stay away from these Jeeps!!!",1.0
"I purchased my last 2 Jeep Wranglers from local Bendigo Jeep dealer who also did all the services. For the first time I am having a major problem with my airbag light staying on and beeping. Jeep head office will not honor the extended warranty that should include addressing the issue. Over 600,000 Jeep Wranglers in the USA were recalled and the part was replaced. Jeep Australia need to seriously questioned as to their professionalism. I have been staunch supported of Jeeps for 20 years and now would seriously recommend that you don't buy a Jeep. The part only costs $250 on eBay. I am very disappointed with Jeep. If you have a Jeep consider selling it before you have a problem and if you are thinking of buying a Jeep I strongly suggest you reconsider!",1.0
"On December 19, 2015 my stick shift 2012 Jeep Wrangler independently accelerated from a dead stop, and drove 60 feet through my garage door. I had started the vehicle, got out, ebrake up. As soon as my feet hit the ground, the jeep took off like someone slammed on the gas. It has been two months since the incident. I have made a claim through Chrysler, that just got 'escalated' to the investigations department that does not have a phone number that I can call - I have to request a call, then wait 2 or 3 days. I've had two appointments at the Jeep service center, and one at a Honda service center.
      Jeep service has done nothing but argue with me get defensive. My first trip to Jeep service ended with the jeep not starting upon pick-up due to their negligence, the second trip to Jeep service ended after they had my vehicle for 5 full days, after being told they would call me - I finally showed up to check on it, and they hadn't touched it since the first day it was there! And since jeep cannot duplicate this independent acceleration, they tell me that nothing is wrong with it. The customer service I've received is disgraceful. The fact that they know that this is happening, and they are ignoring it - gross and negligent!",1.0
"I have had several minor-severe problems concerning my 2012 Jeep Wrangler. Just to list a few it's 2016 my clock still does not work (bought in 2012) never has. My steering wheel electrocuted/SHOCKED/zapped my husband while we were driving and almost caused us to get in an accident, once that got fixed it happened again with the horn alarming for 5 minutes straight every time we got in or out of the car causing problems at the hotel I worked at. 
      Tire pressure light has never properly worked. Back leather seat spontaneously ripped about 10 inches (no kids, never used the back seat). Driver side visor mirror fell off while driving, again another possible accident. Rear door automatic lock makes loud noises and won't lock. Hard top has chipped edge that I did not notice when purchasing. I notified dealership almost every time, they never fixed as promised. Center counsel compartment has always been wobbly and loose. License plate holder cheap and broken, I can go on. I have had my Jeep in the dealership service department for full days at a time so many I can't even count. I have an entire file cabinet dedicated to Jeep problems. Many times would pick it up from dealership with nothing having been done due to lack of parts or knowledge. I was directed to Chrysler corporate and was really happy working with an agent named Holly. She offered me an owner's maintenance policy with free oil changes and extended warranty in case any additional problems occurred. Went to use my warranty at the dealership because go figure more problems and she did not document the promises. I tried straightening it out with corporate and they are unhelpful, rude and don't care about their loyal customers. If an employee does not do their job the customer should not know or have to deal with it. Very unprofessional!!! I am extremely disappointed! Owning a Wrangler had been my dream, now it's my nightmare!",1.0
"I took my Jeep Wrangler 2010 two weeks ago at the Jeep dealership here in Gainesville, Fl. Apparently it needs a gear shaft. The problem I'm having is the part is not in stock till the end of February. How is it that such a big company does not have the part. So I called corporate headquarters, they gave me a case number ** for my complaint. I have not heard back from the case manager. It has been two weeks. I keep calling my dealership and they have not heard from them either for a status update. So please give me suggestions.",1.0

"Purchased a 2012 wrangler from dealer in May. Since then I've had vehicle back for repairs on 7 different occasions. Salesman Randy assured vehicle was sound and went thru 168 point inspection prior to sale. Yet within 48 hrs of my purchase, vehicle transmission acting up, ABS sensor failed, anti-skid sensor failed, rear axles seals leaking, windows wouldn't zip closed, roof started leaking.
      Battery failed, wiper motor stopped working, and now a mold condition has taken over entire vehicle. As a former 911 responder I advised that I cannot drive vehicle with mold as a result of respiratory disease. I complained about roof and was told twice that they couldn't duplicate leak in spite of 2"" water on floor boards. After months of dealing with leak - once vehicle 3 mos warranty expired they miraculously found leak. Dealer misrepresented this vehicle from the start. They replaced heads weeks before they sold this vehicle to me - coupled with the many repairs required in 6 months I've owned the vehicle indicates to me that Hendricks Jeep doesn't care about consumers. The vehicle has spent 32 at dealership in 6 months and I've wasted countless days back and forth to no avail. This vehicle had been a headache since purchase and I will never buy another jeep again. Hendrick I. Concord is a disgrace.",1.0
"I got a brand new Wrangler 2009. Two days after my happiness the rain started and I got water all over me from the roof and the doors. I was in a big pool. I went to the dealer and they told me that's a normal issue in jeep. I insisted in my unhappiness and they changed the door's seal in the most nasty way that I told the manager to stop the mechanic from vandalizing my property.
      A month later the motor didn't start. I went back full of water again and they kept the jeep for a whole day to tell me they can't duplicate the problem and after many visits and going to different dealers I got the same answer: problem never fixed and by the opinion of the same mechanics I got a lemon. After my long agony I talked with a few lawyers and unfortunately I was two weeks late to qualify, the fact that made Chrysler very happy to tell me, ""Good luck,"" hanging up on me, and of course more problems were on the road (one quarter of oil extra every 700 miles, transmission stick disconnected multiple times, front suspension vibration for defective tires, door lock problems all the time, alarm system doesn't work). These malfunctions were never fixed. In conclusion I never recommend jeep. These are a real POS products.",1.0
"I bought my 2013 Jeep Wrangler with 17,000 miles 2 years ago and since then the ABS sensor on the tires have locked up twice without any warning. I had one of the sensors replaced Sept 2014 and now exactly 1 years later I was driving on I-75 outside of Atlanta on Friday afternoon when my brakes completely locked up without any warning. Thank goodness it did not cause an accident, but there is SERIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH A VEHICLE THAT THE BRAKES WILL LOCK UP ON THE INTERSTATE WITHOUT ANY WARNING OR OTHER MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. After finally making it back from Atlanta I was able to drop the car off at the dealership and they want to charge me $230. Ridiculous! The last bonus to owning a Jeep is each tire has a sensor so if I continue to drive this junk I have 2 more tires that can lock up without ANY warning.",1.0
"So I bought a 2014 Jeep Wrangler Overland in Rock Lobster Red, here's my list of fun: On the after sales sheets I found the model to actually be the 2013.. 1 month later Roof started leaking on the passenger side. 2 months after having the car, mechanical issues started, engine light came on. These malfunction codes came up on the dash: P0006, P0016, P0300, P000D, P0018.
      Took the Jeep in 3 times over a month period, each time Jeep service said the car is fixed. I get it back, drive out the driveway and the light returns! Jeep service didn't give us any reports/receipts for these trips so I requested them all, they ended up giving me the entire history of reports on every time it went to the workshop, starting 1 month before I bought it. That's when I found out the oil pressure switch had been recalled. The salesman of course failed to mention this.. Jeep service along with Jeep Australia refused to fix the car under warranty, stating I had taken the Jeep Wrangler offroading and water had 'draw into' the engine. The service manager relentlessly accused me of submerging 'the entire car,' I told them from the start that I had done some beginner offroading but not gone in anything deeper than a 10cm puddle on an unsealed road!Roof still not fixed, I find out from an independent mechanic that the leaky roof is a factory fault that cannot be fixed, all that can be done is give me a replacement. I ask Jeep service why the roof isn't fixed, they said I didn't tell them to inspect it this time, but I sure as sugar did, and have 2 witnesses. Jeep service said the only thing that can be done is replace the engine at a cost of $30,000.00 to me. I told them if I had submerged the engine give me proof, they show me pathetic photos of muddy water splashed on the exterior of the engine. I ask them to give me actual evidence of 'water entering the engine,' they said they won't dismantle the engine until I agree to pay for the job as a retail dismantle, costing $1500, to be payable if they find the problem not to be a factory fault. By this point I am completely frustrated and have no faith in their work. I get the Jeep towed to an independent mechanic, who (after having the jeep for 1 morning) tells me the problem is the oil pressure not being sufficient enough to keep tension on the timing chain.. Also that there is no way there is water in the engine, as it starts and runs fine.Jeep Australia, the dealer and the service centre received calls from my mechanic, he received slanderous comments against me, saying I was rude and nasty, and that I wanted to get rid of the Jeep from the inception. Also that they had shown me a sample of water in the oil, which they most certainly did NOT! By the time the Jeep had its engine troubles I had already spent $10,000.00 on upgrades. I absolutely love that Jeep and have never asked for a refund.Looking through at the reports I received from Jeep service, the second time I brought the jeep in they had changed the oil pump and performed an engine flush. This seemed to clear the engine codes but caused a new one! P06DD - engine oil pressure stuck low, so this whole time they have been trying to cover their **, and trying to get me to pay for a malfunction THEY'VE caused! Don't get me wrong - I loved that jeep, and it performed very well, but as soon as Jeep service got their incompetent hands on it, and Jeep Australia got involved, the car was ruined. I'm sorry I bought a jeep.",1.0

"I live in the Rocky Mountains and I bought two jeeps from Christopher Dodge world in Golden Colorado. I finally traded in my 2008 Jeep because it started having issues with only 52,000 miles on it. I decided to upgrade to a jeep Rubicon wrangler. It has 13,000 miles on it...the engine light just continues to keep on going on. Even though I have a five year warranty on this Rubicon I continuously have to take it back to the dealership and for some reason the professional technicians can't even figure it out. 
      There's got to be a law about this. I will never buy a jeep again from this dealership or Jeep. They are overrated and for being such a rugged truck jeep claims maybe they should go back to the drawing board, get their engineers to look at their mistakes, and fix them. I should've stayed European. I went American because I wanted it to be made in the US. I wonder why people go to the European to buy their cars BMW Porsche... I should've stayed with European cars!",1.0
"The engine failed in my 2011 Jeep Wrangler. It has a 5 year 100k mile Drivetrain warranty. They would not honor the warranty as the first thing they did was drain the oil out of it and they found that it only had 1 quart of oil in it, so they said the warranty was void due to customer neglect. I provided documentation that I properly changed its oil during its 50,000 mile history and also provided documentation that the fluids were checked 4 weeks and 800 miles prior to its failure. There was no oil on my driveway and it is parked in the same spot every night. They also indicated that there were no signs of any leaks on the engine. I also should add that the oil light never came on until 5 minutes before the engine quit.",1.0
"I bought a new 2 door RHD 2006 jeep wrangler. The electronics started going bad at 3000 miles. All the icons went on in the dash. When I turned off the jeep it wouldn't restart. I had to have it towed several times for this problem. This happened over and over again until I traded it. Here are a list of excuses they gave me each time I took it in for the exact same problem that was never resolved!!! We need to order a new computer, yours is faulty. Remove the seat cover, it creates static when you slid into the seat, then shorts out the the computer when you touch the key to turn on the jeep. 
      We need to replace the computer a second time. When your car won't start, disconnect the battery from the cables, then reconnect them, and it should start. We need to replace the computer a 3rd time. Don't use the cigarette lighter in your jeep to charge your phone, we think it's causing the computer to short out. We think you have a lemon trade it in. Sooooooo that's what I did. I traded it in with only 15000 miles. We bought a New 2009 4 door RHD Jeep Wrangler. This jeep started having the exact same problems with the electronics as the 06. In and out of the shop for repairs that never seemed to work. I was forced to traded this one in on a 2012 Wrangler because they told me it had a new engine that would have better gas millage. I told them I didn't care about the mileage, I WANTED A JEEP I COULD COUNT ON TO RUN PROPERLY FOR MORE THAN ON YEAR!!! I need to know if the jeep engineers got the electronics fixed. They said they had. So I now own a 3rd jeep, a 2012 Wrangler. # in 6 years. They don't last even 2 years. I had a few minor issues with this 2012 jeep in the beginning, then at 45000 all hell seems to have broken loose. Head gaskets needed replaced, cylinder head needed replaced, cruise control went out and took 3 tries to fix. The oil switch went out the day after the cylinder head was replaced. FYI: All these problems happened in less than 6 weeks. The oil switch in all of these jeeps are faulty and fail according to the person I bought the switch from. He said they keep 25 in stock at all times because jeep owners are always needing them. WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL ON THIS PART??? All this has happened in less than 6 weeks. I see the writing on the wall. 3 lemons in a row. If I could find another company who makes RHD SUV's, {I need a Right hand drive for my job} I would trade it in today and NEVER BUY ANOTHER JEEP VEHICLE IN MY LIFE. I don't blame the mechanics for the problems with these vehicles. Jeep makes a very poor product right from the factory and the mechanics are stuck dealing with the fall out from angry customers. I want to tell everyone who reads this to avoid buying jeeps. They are a very poorly made vehicle and are now ranked at the bottom in customer satisfaction. Your money would be better spent and any other car or truck made any where in the world. DON""T BUY JEEPS! I don't think these vehicles deserve even 1 star, so I'm giving it ""0"" stars",1.0

"I purchased a 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited in September of 2014. I purchased it at Cherry Hill Jeep, NJ. Upon Pa inspection, 4 days later, I was informed the driver door seemed to have a closing issue. I returned to Cherry Hill Jeep at scheduled service time, waited patiently while the Jeep was serviced and when complete, there was no difference in the door closing. The Service Manager walked the lot with me checking other Jeep doors for comparison. Then - wait for it - says to me ""We'll, it is a Jeep. If you really need it fixed I guess we can re-drill the hinges."" I left the Dealer in my 42K New Jeep with a door that doesn't close.
      Two weeks with customer service who refers me to Catlin Jeep in Jenkintown Pa. Nice dealer great service. They would love to help me but the door hinges are stripped and need to be ordered in. Another service appointment a week later and the door, no difference.

"Heater blows hot at 20 degree setting after a 1/2 hour to hour drive. Started blowing cool air, taken to dealer 3 times - 19000 km 2012 Wrangler Unlimited v6. Derrick ** in Edmonton argued nothing wrong. Taken to different dealer. Confirmed heat hotter on one side than the other. Replaced rad cap, rad, heater hoses,oil cooler; removed dash complete replaced heater core, flushed engine. 5 days without transportation.

"I purchased a brand new 2013 Jeep Wrangler in October 2013. I took it to my property upstate and drove up my mountain on Memorial Day weekend 2013. We did a little bit of 4-wheeling. The clutch broke as we were driving it home and had to leave it there (the car had a little over 6,000 miles on it). They had my car for 3 weeks and they covered the clutch under the warranty. Then, in September 2014, the bearings went. They had my car again for 3 weeks and again covered the repair under the warranty. Now the entire rear end went, including the transmission again and they refused to cover it. I used the car one weekend as an off-road vehicle, which they advertise it for, and they said that I abused the car because there is mud and grass underneath it. The car has 12,000 miles on it.",1.0
"I have owned 5 Jeep Wranglers and I love them with one major exception-- cracked windshields. In the last year I have had 6 new windshields due to rock chips cracking my windshield. I am only driving on the highway for my daily commute. I am a proactive defensive driver and I avoid rock trucks and driving in the right lane (because of rock gravel on the side of the road). I just bought a new Wrangler last Sat and ALREADY I have a rock chip (not even a week old). And I am waiting to see if it will spread to a crack today. 
      I am completely fed up with this issue. Jeep needs to address it and either reduce the angel of the windshields or develop a more durable, crack resistant windshield. When I lived back east I never had trouble with cracks-- lots of chips but no cracks. I have to get a new windshields about every 2-3 months now-- it's completely unacceptable! I have full glass coverage but now because of how frequent it is I get hassled by my insurance company and they insist on inspecting my crack before fixing it. I have to take off work or waste an evening at home waiting for them to show up to fix my windshield. This is a defect in my book. Any other part that broke this often from NORMAL use would be a defect. We need bulletproof glass windshields in AZ, I am serious. The insurance company has paid for 6 windshields this year and I am betting today when I leave work I will have a new crack so it will be 7 windshields. The cost of a bulletproof windshield would be cheaper in the long run. Look, I love Jeep Wranglers and as I said I have owned 5 but this windshield thing is making me want to buy something else next time.",1.0

After doing some research I have found out this part has went out on a lot of 08 wranglers, and it is a safety issue and I do not understand why there has not been a recall.

"I custom ordered, and purchased a brand new 2013 Jeep Wrangler, in October of 2013. I had almost every option installed, as it was going to be my only vehicle, and I expected to keep it for many years. After the first winter, in New England, I noticed there were tiny rust colored dots, on the white painted surfaces of the Wrangler. Everywhere on the sides, including in the doorjambs and around the rear of the vehicle. The only areas not showing signs of the issue was the upper portions of the front fenders, and the hood. I returned to the dealer in the spring, and was told it was ""rail-dust"". They kept the vehicle for several days, and washed it, used clay-bar on it, and even had to repaint one of the doors, due to the damage caused during the process. Once done, the Jeep looked new again.
      The following winter came and went, and along with spring, the small orange rust spots were back in full force. The dealer had me bring it back in again, and took photos, and indicated they had never seen anything like it. They requested that I take it over to the auto body for review. Prior to heading over there, I showed the same spots, on another Jeep, in the service parking lot, to my service rep. Off to the auto body they sent it, to be reviewed by the auto body manager. He too had no reason for the spots. .After waiting for many weeks, I finally had to reach out to them, to find out what the story was, and how they would fix the issue. I was met with the response that Chrysler is declining to fix it, based on the fact it is not a defect. I am not sure anyone wants to drive a $44,000.00 White Wrangler, with hundreds or thousands of rust spots on it. Nor should anybody be expected to believe it is not a defect in some way, shape, or form, in regards to the product itself.I called Chrysler and was greeted with similar response from the customer service folks there. Except they claimed the Dealer is the one declining the repairs, and responsibility. It became a finger pointing exercise, between the two groups, both telling me that I am out of luck, and they will do nothing more to resolve the issue. I will add the Case manager at Chrysler, along with the others at Chrysler are well trained, to happily thank you for being a member of the Jeep family. But, we won't fix your issue.All requests for contact information for the regional manager were declined, as well as the request for a copy of the recorded conversations; where the Case's manager told me that she is only the messenger, and not an expert, at the start of the call. Only to follow up comments later on in the call, telling me how it can't be from the front brake pads, as there would be other symptoms. It seems that one can indeed be an expert, when trying to convince someone of the reasons why they won't fix a problem. She sure was a happy Jeep family member though, and happily thanked me for being one too. After many calls, to different departments, as well as emails and website submissions, I have got nowhere. Now I am stuck with a very expensive option of having the vehicle treated every year, at my expense, in order to not have these rust spots on my paint.",1.0
"I have a 2009 Jeep Wrangler. I purchased it brand new in July of 2009. I trailered it to AZ when I moved there and it has less than 50,000 miles on it. I moved back to Florida and trailered it back.

"I own a 2007 Jeep Wrangler unlimited. I've had a problem with my Jeep since I bought it new. While driving, a light on the dash lights up and rings. Immediately, I lose power and the power will not come back until I've restarted the car. This can happen anywhere at anytime, though I've noted that it happens far more in the summer than the winter. Of course, I don't know if that means anything, but I can go months through the winter without it happening. It happens several times a day in the summertime. I initially took it to the dealership and was told that since it wasn't showing the light and having the problem at that time, they couldn't do anything about it. 
      The next time it happened, I drove it all the way to the dealership and showed them the light and let them drive it while it was on. They kept my Jeep for a couple of days and then came back to tell me that I was having this problem because I put my foot on the brake and the gas at the same time. Odd. I never do that yet it happens multiple times a day. Even odder, it happens to everyone that's ever driven my car. We're all just a bunch of idiots putting our foot on the brake and gas at the same time. I've given up. I now drive in anticipation of the light/power loss and sometimes I'll turn the car off, then back on only to have it happen 2 minutes later.

It made the sound that my car makes if the clutch is not engaged or when I try to start the car with my spare that doesn't have a security chip installed. My tank was full. I first called Jeep's 1-800 service number that was located in my owner's manual to see if someone could help me troubleshoot the problem. I was told that they couldn't do anything. 
      I have AAA, so I called and the service sent someone to jump my car. My battery was a little low, but after the service man jumped the car, it still wouldn't start. I am a community leader and had several important events to attend that day as well as on Monday. I ended up spending almost $40 to get to church and then bummed a ride home. My sister brought over my spare key, because I thought the security chip in my key might have gotten demagnetized some way. As it turns out, the spare key didn't work either. I had an hour before my next event and I needed to get groceries. The person who gave me a ride home also took me to the grocery store. I spent the rest of the day, bumming rides to each of my events. The next day (MLK Day), I was supposed to be at work hosting three volunteer projects at my nonprofit organization. Instead, I had my car towed to the dealership where they had to run a diagnostic check to find the problem with my car. As it turns out, all that was needed was a software update. However, the service department also found two additional issues with my car. But, because I had to pay for the diagnostic, I was not able to afford the other more serious issues with my car which were brake and battery-related. I understand that the dealership had to charge me for the diagnostic because they did not know until they ran it what was wrong with my car. I'm upset that Jeep did not send me a notice to let me know that this could happen. I feel that Jeep owes me a reimbursement or a credit for the diagnostic check. When I called Customer Service, the rep and her supervisor, both stated that Jeep would not compensate me for either my inconvenience or their lack of notification even though I have been a loyal Jeep owner since 1991. I think this is wrong and anything that can be done to help me, I want done. Thanks!",1.0
"2014 Jeep Wrangler, bought on August 29, 2013 from Larry Miller Jeep in Tucson, AZ. Incident occurred on Sunday, October 13 at noon. I was on our driveway, approaching our house and had pressed the garage door opener. I was moving slowly forward into the garage, and about 4 feet from the opening of the garage, the jeep suddenly lurched forward and made a loud revving noise as it accelerated into the garage. I stomped my foot on the brakes, but it still slammed into the garage wall. There are brake skid marks all along the garage floor.
      I was completely shocked by what had happened, and thought that the best thing to do would be to back off the wall a little, park the car and go into the house to phone for help. I put the jeep into reverse, and it again revved suddenly and shot backwards at a high rate of speed. It shot back about 30 feet, running down a rocky embankment in front of our house, taking out two mesquite trees, and slamming into a concrete structure holding our mailbox.The mailbox structure was shattered, and in the house, the wall that was hit was knocked inward. Pictures and lamps inside the house were knocked over. I sustained chest injuries and whiplash. My doctor was surprised that the airbag had not deployed.",1.0

"My son, a veteran of Operations Enduring Freedom, recently purchased a new 2013 Jeep Wrangler - a beautiful vehicle. He had it for around two months. Yesterday, it stopped running. He had it towed to a local dealer. Mind you, it still has the original warranty and my son purchased the lifetime warranty. The dealer claims that the clutch was abused and that the warranties are not applicable. My son did not abuse his Jeep, and for the record, this is his second Jeep. The previous one NEVER had a clutch issue. I called the dealer where my son purchased the Jeep. They informed me that they have had several 2013 Jeeps where the clutch failed and were replaced, without hesitation, with Chrysler's blessings. Are there issues with the 2013 clutches? Can anyone help my son?",1.0
"I bought a 2005 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited back in Nov. of last year. The 2nd day I had it, I went to start it and the starter went. Well, I called them up and I said, ""You better send a tow truck and pick this up and fix it; I'm not dealing with it."" Well, I got it back and then noticed in the driveway that there was wet oil everywhere - oh, a hole in the oil pan. They fixed that, then when I got it back, I was going 55 -60 mph and the front end and steering wheel shook so bad I had everything I could do to keep it on the road. 
      So, I took it back. They changed the rotors - that didn't work. They changed the steering dampers and that worked. So, the first 2 weeks after buying it, I couldn't even drive it. I had to get a hold of the BBB twice because they started to refuse fixing anything anymore. So, like 2 months ago, I took it in because it had a ticking noise that would go away when I push down the clutch. I took it to Jeep dealership. They said clutch is going and your 4x4 drive shaft needs to be replaced; it will be $1600 to fix everything.  I'm disabled and fighting cancer. I couldn't afford it. So, I had them fix the drive shaft, a 200 dollar deductible and 100 dollars to take top off clutch and examine, lol. So, I took it somewhere else for half the price to fix the clutch and slave cylinder another 800 dollars. Now it's a squeaking piece of **. I took it back to the place that did the clutch. He said, ""There is so much metal in the inside of the transmission that everything is wobbling inside transmission; I can't do anything it's not the clutch."" Now, I'm stuck with a piece of crap that I'm afraid to bring back to dealership and spend more money I don't have. I am not a happy camper. How can you people sell these cars to people? I thought they were supposed to be solid vehicles. I've had nothing but issues. I don't know what to do.",1.0

Second problem, why do I smell exhaust fumes in the cabin? I love my Jeep but I can't have this! Any suggestions out there? I am currently looking into legal matters.

"I have owned my 2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon for a year now and it has 10,900 miles on it. On Monday, February 25, 2013, Amarillo, TX received 19 inches of snow and had wind gust up to 75 mph. I bought this Rubicon since it is supposed to be a strong 4x4 and I could depend on it to get me to work and home. I had my Jeep in 4-wheel high and was in front of the shop of my store and was attempting a U-turn when I became high centered in the snow due to the drifts. I stopped, put the Jeep in neutral, engaged 4-wheel low and locked the lockers to get myself out. I tried going forward, then stopped and put in reverse to try and back out. After trying to go forward again, a loud pop came from the front of my Jeep and I stopped and put into park. After pulling the Jeep out in reverse with another vehicle, we jacked it up and winched my Jeep in my work shop. We noticed the U-joints, ball joints, and axle shafts were all shattered. 
      I contacted the two Jeep dealerships in Amarillo and they both told me straight no on any warranty, even without seeing the Jeep. Texas Dodge told me it was in an accident or I was on dry pavement, and with 19 inches of snow, there was not any dry pavement. I paid for a guy to tow my Jeep to the Texas Dodge dealership so they could look at the damage on Wednesday, February 27, 2013. Allen in the service department called me and told me it was not a part failure and I needed to claim it on my insurance. No warranty would cover it. I called the customer service phone number and all they would do is tell me ""We back our dealerships with their decisions."" I have pictures and video of the incident and it shows the front tires were spinning freely and not in any bind, so it had to be a part failure somewhere. If this is as good as the Rubicon is, quit advertising them as off road vehicles.",1.0
"We purchased a 2012 Wrangler Jeep. We owned a soft top Jeep for 15 years and never had a problem. Now, we have already had our new jeep brought to the dealership 3 times for the same problem; it leaks! To pay that much money for a vehicle and have this happen very often disheartens us. I have never commented on any website, but I felt that I needed to speak out. To read all of the other comments about the problems that other people are having, and to see that Chrysler is not even addressing the situation, is unbelievable. Monday will make the 4th time that we are taking our Jeep back for the same problem. I do not think it will be resolved. What should we do?",1.0
"2011 Jeep Wrangler, driven through 17"" of water at speeds less than shown on **, can't handle water splashing on engine. The engine quit in the middle of the puddle and we had to tow it to the dealer where they tell us that the engine is ruined and needs to be replaced and not covered under warranty due to the vehicle being submerged in water. We did nothing more than drive it through a puddle on a gravel road. This is supposed to be an off-road vehicle equipped for this environment. The engine is either faulty, the air-intake design bad, or they are intentionally false-advertising the vehicle's capabilities.",1.0

"I bought the brand new Jeep Wrangler Sahara on 28 July 2012 from the Fourways branch of Chrysler Jeep. After about two weeks, we visited friends in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, close to the Kruger National Park. We drove around on the dirt road in the park and the evening while returning to our friends' home, the break light went on. It was very heavy traffic on the N3 highway and I was struggling with the brakes, as only the ABS was working and I had to apply the brakes heavily before coming to a stand-still; what an exciting/horrible experience. 
      The following day (Saturday), I took the Wrangler to the Chrysler/Jeep dealership in Nelspruit, who informed me that they are not supposed to work on my car because of the contract between Chrysler/Jeep and Mercedes being terminated. Eventually, two technicians came out to the garage and put the car on their monitor system, but could not find anything wrong. They advised me to drive back to Johannesburg and that nothing would happen and that the brakes would not fail. And so we did; what an experience again on the highway after a long weekend! Eventually, the car was fixed by Fourways Chrysler/Jeep after they (by luck) found out that there was a one-way valve in the brake system that did not work properly, so the hydraulic system could not operate properly.Last weekend, my wife and I went hiking near Bela Bela (Warmbaths) in the ""Waterberg"" (Water Mountains). As I left the tar road, the Wrangler came to a stand-still with a hell of a clapping noise. The propshaft broke off! A Wrangler Sahara, an off-road vehicle! On an ordinary dirt road (with the normal rocky sections and corrugations on which you normally don't drive more than 60-70 kilometers an hour)! What a wonderful car! Fortunately, my wife was transported by friends who came past to the hiking camp. I had to wait at the car for four hours in the dark (in the veld) before a truck turned up to carry the Wrangler to Pretoria. The arrangements by Jeep to send out a ""courtesy vehicle"" never realized. The friendly Jeep people of the Constantia branch did a great job to lend me a car in the meantime while they are ""still deciding whether my car must be replaced or not."" Well, when I read the comments on this site, I just realized that that would never happen. But, I can tell you, I have lost complete trust in ""my"" Jeep Wrangler Sahara, 5,000 kilometers ""old"". What a Jeep experience. I am going to take this further!",1.0
"While driving to work on Thursday, 8/9/2012, my 1999 Jeep Wrangler stopped running. After calling them, I had it towed to Soutars Chrysler Dodge Jeep Toyota, 631 West Main Street, Barstow, CA 92311. Their phone number is 760-256-3502. Since they couldn't repair my Jeep right away, they shuttled me back to my RV. On 8/15/2012, Soutars called me and told me my Jeep was repaired and ready to pick up. They said that the problem was the fuel pump. They sent their shuttle driver to pick me up and deliver me to the dealership at 10:00AM on 8/15/2012. Upon arriving at Soutars, I paid $908.08 as per the repair order and went out to start my Jeep. It would not start so I went back inside and that I could not take it because it was not running. It was not repaired. 
      They said that they would need to call the Chrysler manufacturer to see if they could walk them through any possible repair it may need. At that point, I let them shuttle me back to my RV in Daggett. Note: I had been staying at the RV Park in Daggett while being on location working on a project at Fort Irwin Military Training Center for my company. Anyway, I waited for them to call me back to let me know the status of my Jeep. When I hadn't heard from them by 5PM, I called them. I asked them if they got my Jeep running and they said no, that it could take a week to get a response back from Chrysler. I said no and told them I wanted it towed out of there and taken to another mechanic's shop. I informed them that I needed my Jeep to get to and from work and that I was from out of town and lived in Vacaville, but was working down at Fort Irwin Military Training Center. Their reply was to tell me no, that it would be my responsibility to arrange that.I managed to locate a competent mechanic. The name of this company is The Car Doctor. The mechanic is Timothy **, 760-694-7633. On 8/16/12, I met Mr. ** at Soutars at 10:00AM. We found that the Jeep battery was completely dead and not only would the battery not turn over, it didn't even make a clicking sound. Mr. ** said he would charge the battery and see what he could do from that point. We towed the jeep to Mr. **'s shop and I told him that Soutars charged me $908.08 for a fuel pump and the Jeep still wouldn't run. At that point, I left and returned back to the RV. Thirty minutes later, Mr. ** called me to tell me the Jeep was running and informed me that the problem was the coil. Mr. ** told me he would get me a new coil and have the Jeep back to me within one hour. While Mr. ** was looking at the Jeep, it was discovered that Souters never did change out my fuel pump.Even though I was charged for a fuel pump and labor, the work had not been done. He told me that I still have the original fuel pump in the jeep. He stated this on my receipt. Mr. ** also informed me that Soutars burned out my battery as well. Mr. ** charged my battery and delivered my Jeep back to me one hour later. My cost for the coil was $32.31 and $105.69 for labor. I immediately called Soutars and asked for my old fuel pump. Their reply was no, that due to a core charge, they had already sent it back. I was unable to retrieve my old parts. On 8/20/12, I got the Jeep back home to Vacaville and immediately took it to my mechanic there: Vaca Valley Auto Care, 1130 E. Monte Vista Ave., Vacaville, CA 95688, 707-446-7664. I had them look at it and they informed me that my battery and alternator were both fried. They were both replaced at a cost of $527.94.I believe I am being ripped off by Soutars and for the cost of a fuel pump that was never replaced, as well as labor and subsequent damages to the battery and alternator which occurred due to their negligence. As a result, I would like to be reimbursed for the charges totaling $1,436.02.",2.0

"I have been having problems with my 2006 Jeep Wrangler. It has been shifting erratically since October of 2011. I took it to the local dealership, Swanty’s Chrysler in Bullhead City, AZ and they said there was nothing wrong with the transmission but couldn't figure out what was wrong. I then took it to an independent auto shop in town and they diagnosed the problem as the PCM (Power Control Module) and told me not to take it back to Swanty's because they wouldn't be able to figure it out and take it to Chapman in Las Vegas. Well, I didn't listen to him and sure enough they couldn't figure it out and said that the PCM was not at fault.
      So, I took it to Las Vegas, 100 miles away, with the print out from the independent in town that points to the PCM as the problem. It had the false codes from his scanner on it. I presented this to the service writer at Chapman and he told me they were transmission codes and not the PCM. I got a call from them a few days later saying that they needed to tear the transmission apart to see what was wrong with it at a cost of $1,050.00 minimum. I said how much it could run up to and was told anywhere from $2,000.00 to $4,000.00 and I could tell to proceed with the repairs at the cost they came up or decline it and still pay $1,050.00. I asked if it seemed like it needed to be rebuilt and was told most likely. I said forget it I can get it done cheaper somewhere else. I also asked if they were positive it was the transmission. They said yes.I took the Jeep to a transmission shop in town and had the transmission rebuilt for $2,014.00. This was not or is not the problem. This past weekend, the owner of the transmission shop went to a seminar of Automatic Transmission Service Group (ATSG), in Phoenix, AZ. This is a national service group dealing with transmission problems across the country. Before he had a chance to bring up the subject of my issue, it was a main topic of the seminar. This problem only relates to the 2006 Jeep Wrangler. In the report it states that in all the calls to the ATSG Tech Line concerning this complaint, it is a 2006 Jeep Wrangler only and it has been the PCM at fault in each instance.Now if the people at the Jeep dealerships would have at least looked into the possibility that the PCM could be at fault, I would have never had my transmission rebuilt and be out the $2,014.00. At the time my PCM was still under warranty. I was told by the dealership and Chrysler, that since they were not the ones who worked on the transmission that there was nothing they could do about it. The point is that I'm out $2,014.00 because I wanted to save some money and not have Chrysler rebuild my transmission.",1.0
"We have not purchased a new car since 2004. We decided on a Jeep Wrangler Sahara, willing to do a 2012 or order 2013. Cost is high. I was shocked at how difficult purchasing a new vehicle can be, what you expect in price and we have been trying to buy for 3 weeks and not one dealership was able to find what we wanted in a 900-mile radius. Our requests are simple for a $30,000+ car. Leather color options are limited, need to get rid of white and stick to dessert tan & saddle leather. We could not find what we wanted in a Wrangler Sahara 2012 so we are trying to build one and were informed today that leather is not an option! Dealing with Jeep has been a frustrating experience. I want what you expect me to pay for it. I am looking to foreign and will keep my old 2004 Jeep. If you can find what we want, contact Mike ** at Tom O'Brien Jeep Greenwood, Indiana.

"My daughter's 2005 JP wrangler TJX auto trans 42RLE corroded connector to internal press sensor was known by Chrysler Corp for years and my daughter (2nd owner) was never notified! This very well may have become a safety issue if the connector failed in heavy highway traffic resulting in injury or fatality. Chrysler did not have the decency to even try to notify her which is quintessential proof that they are just like the aristocratic 1% of (so called) Americans who are so mean spirited, corrupt, disingenuous, greedy, barbaric, all other adjectives that describe the evil influence in our country. While the ultra bailout queen by working Americans could have corrected this anomaly early on, Chrysler deliberately shirked their corporate responsibilities, cunningly and amorally denied customer legal information because of warranty issues. The end result of Chrysler's plutocratic philosophy manifested in my daughter's outlay of monies from her limited and meager income. From this day forth, I will demonize Chrysler in all the possible extreme avenues at my disposal. May your ** of an auto corporation fail.

"My 2010 Jeep Wrangler had four active recalls and a water leak around the driver side door. I have concerns that the recalls were not fixed. The rag top which was to be fixed using padding did not appear to be any different than when I took it in to be fixed (no additional padding). This makes me question the other ""fixes"". Additionally, after I informed the dealer of a water leak around the driver side front door, even placed a paper napkin in the gasket to ID leak site, I was told that I needed new weather stripping at a cost of $700. After I declined the repair ($700 for weather stripping, you would have to be crazy to pay that), I received a bill for $120 for ""diagnostic testing"" to ID the water leak problem. What could you possibly do to charge $120 to determine that I needed weather stripping after I pretty much diagnosed it for them? And what really made me mad was that the paper napkin that I placed in the gasket was still there, never disturbed. How could they have ""diagnosed"" this problem without even moving the paper napkin? Don't go the East Hills Jeep for help, you won't get it.",1.0

I had it towed to the dealer, and they said it was totally destroyed inside. It cost $3,359 to get it fixed. There is no reason for this transmission to fail like that.

"Poor quality workmanship by the Jeep manufacturing plant: I have a 2007 Jeep Wrangler Safari (Rescue Green) with 54,000 km and in excellent condition. It got keyed on the rear panel above the rear wheel and the top of the door edge, so I had to take it to a body shop specified by the insurance company to have it repaired. When the manager of the body shop and I were looking at the scratch, we noticed the paint on the ""door hinges"" was blistering. So, I asked him if he could fix it. He said he would check to find out what the problem was when they removed the door and hinges to repair the scratch. 
      He removed the hinges, which were made of aluminum, and found that the steel doors and hinge posts on the frame had not been treated or painted under the hinges at the factory causing these areas to rust which in turn caused the paint on the hinges to blister. The estimate to repair this problem was in excess of $3000, but because the Jeep was in to be repaired as a result of the keying and that it duplicated some of the disassembly, it actually cost me $1271.00 to have the hinge beds ground to remove the rust, acidized to kill any rust not removed by grinding, rust prevention-treated, and painted as well as the gaskets made to fix the problem. I contacted the Jeep customer care for two reasons: (1) To let them know that their doors and frame were rusting under the hinges due to lack of preparation and paint at the factory, so they could improve their quality and correct this defect; and (2) the cost to me as a result of this factory defect. They said I should have taken it to a dealership, but it would have made no difference because it was out of warranty. They did not seem interested in the fact that this factory defect leading to the rusty hinge beds and frame could possibly exist and cause the same problem in all the jeeps where the door and hinges had been painted the same color.I have pictures of the rust on the hinge posts and beds on the doors showing they had not been painted prior to the hinges being installed at the factory which I sent to Customer Care at their request. They said they couldn't do anything for me because it was out of warranty. I explained to the Jeep representative that in my mind, the corrosion protection warranty applied to parts that had been painted and protected from the elements but that this area of the door and frame had not been prepared or painted at all prior to the hinges being installed at the factory and was probably guaranteed to become rusty by water entering and running down inside the doors between the window and outside door panel. They said again that they were not interested because I had not taken it to a dealership, which would have meant the body shop re-assembling the doors at my cost so I could take it to the dealership for them to take it apart again at my cost to see the rusty areas, which they would not have fixed because it was out of warranty.I seemed to be going round in circles. They did not thank me for bringing this factory defect to their attention so they could rectify the problem and prevent it happening on all future jeeps, and they were not interested in any form of compensation for the cost involved to me having to repair the problem. In addition, because the door is steel and the hinges are aluminum, it promotes corrosion due to electrolysis caused by dissimilar metals. (There was no gasket installed between the door and the hinge to prevent contact.)In conclusion, if you have a Jeep, check the hinges on your jeep before the end of the three-year corrosion protection warranty. It is an expensive repair if your hinge paint is starting to blister. If you're considering buying a jeep, be aware of this problem.",2.0
"To start off, I want to say that I am overall happy with my Jeep. But there are several issues that need to be addressed. First off, I only had the jeep 2 months and the transmission went out. Jeep towed and fixed it. I was happy with that. I started to have problems with the radio popping and no sound. I took it to shop, and they replaced the radio. But when this happened a second time, I was starting to get worried. It seemed to work at that time.
      At approximately 25000 miles while traveling 81 south at 65, there was such a violent shake in the front. I thought that I had a flat tire. Mind you, I had an 18 wheeler behind me and a van beside me. The shake was to the point of almost losing control of the vehicle. I pulled off the road to find that there was no flat and nothing appeared to be broken on the jeep. I continued down 81 to have it happen several times after that. On the way back, it happened several more times; but I learned that upon hitting bumps in the road, it would shake. I called the dealer and told them what was going on. They stated that the steering stabilizer was the cause and that I could bring the jeep in and have it fixed. I did this. Not once did they test-drive the Jeep.After leaving the shop on 501n, the wobble was back and almost caused an accident with a Coca-cola truck and van with a family inside. I called the shop, and they stated to bring it back and they would look further. That was done, and they stated they could not find anything. Again, they did not test-drive it. So I drove away and drove only when I had to. The last time that it did it, I was instructed to take it to another shop to ""have a different set of eyes look at it."" While en route to that shop, it happened just before I arrived; and I told them that it just happened. I waited for 3 hours, and again, the Jeep was never test-driven. They stated that the rotors were dipped out and was the cause. Needing a second opinion, I went back to the original shop and had them look at it. This time, the shop stated that the tires were the problem. So I asked about the new tires, and they told me I would have to go to Goodyear and have them handle this. I went to Goodyear, and they said nothing was wrong with the tires. I called Jeep, and they stated there was nothing they could find. And so, I was out of money and time from work. I went and had a new bigger stabilizer placed on the Jeep and was told this would only mask the problem for a while. A few thousand miles later, the ""Death Wobble"" was back. I called the head office and was told that this was moved to tier 2 and district manager was going to be involved and that he would be calling me back. For 2 months, there's no word. So I called the office again, and they stated that notes state that the district manager reviewed my case and stood behind the shop and case was closed. I went and spent $1200 on new tires, and it seems to be better. But I'm still nervous about driving much. It is a 2007 Jeep Wrangler unlimited 4dr and has, as of today, 37,426 miles. I fear for my safety and that of my families and the other people on the road. Upon going to the gas station about 4 months ago, I filled the Jeep up and it burped back about 1/2 gallon of gas back on the ground and in my eye. They attended and asked me to please place some hydro down to absorb the gas. This issue is still an ongoing issue. I took the Jeep to a shop that I trust and had a pm done on the Jeep. They found that one of the front joints was bad and needed to be replaced. But now, for the last couple of weeks, the stereo is popping and losing sound again. So this will make 3 stereos in this Jeep that have gone bad in less than 5 years. Think that this is a little much. I understand that the Jeep is out of warranty, but after all this trouble and money that I have spent trying to fix it, it is a little excessive. I just want someone from Jeep to call me and listen to what I have to say.",1.0
"On Sunday, May 20, while driving through some puddles on a dirt road after a rain storm, the front axle (passenger side) on my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon snapped. After getting it back to town, I looked at the damage and found signs that the axle had been cracked for a long time and finally broke. There are lots of rust at the site of the break. If this were a fresh break, there would be no rust. So, the axle has been cracked for a long time. Photos were taken.
      On Tuesday, May 22, I called the area Chrysler dealership to find out if this was a part covered under warranty. I was told it was, and I had the Jeep brought to the dealership for an inspection. On Wednesday, May 23, I received a phone call from the dealership. They took a look at the broken axle, took pictures and sent a report to the Chrysler District Manager for approval for the warranty.On Wednesday, May 30, after a week of going to the dealership and getting no answer, I received a phone call and was told the warranty claim was denied. I was not impressed. I called Chrysler Customer Care to escalate the situation. On Friday, June 1, a rep from Chrysler Customer Care contacted me. This rep is the case manager in charge of my case. The rep told me they would be in touch with me throughout the duration of the case. This was the 1st and last time they called me.On Thursday, June 7, after calling several times with no answer, leaving messages, and not getting a return, I finally got through to the case manager. I was told the pictures were being reviewed by the Chrysler engineers and I should have a response by the end of the day. No answer and I continued to call for another week and I could not get a hold of the case manager.On Wednesday, June 13, after 3 weeks from the start of this ordeal, I called the case manager and was told the engineers reviewed the pictures and were denying the claim as well, stating that after reviewing the pictures they say there is a single, small mark on the bracket that connects the stabilizer arm to the axle case indicating there was an impact that caused the break in the axle. This small mark doesn't show near enough damage to break the axle.This is a faulty part covered under the warranty my jeep is still covered by. The proof is in the pictures. In my opinion, the Chrysler engineers have a biased opinion and, of course, will continue to deny the warranty with whatever little mark they can use. This needs to go further, and should be examined by a third party. I was told it would cost $5100 to repair the axle. These axles don't just break. It would take an immense impact to break it, and there would surely be signs of a large impact, which there isn't, and not a small rub mark. This issue needs to be corrected, and Chrysler needs to be accountable for faulty or malfunctioning parts.",1.0
"I was at drive-thru getting coffee when all of a sudden, the horn started sounding, wipers turned on and wiper fluid started spraying. I called the dealer who said to bring it in. I did and because they couldn't replicate the issue, they documented it and sent me on my way. No problem, bring it in right away if it happens again. After researching the issue on the net, I found it's a common issue with 2008 Wrangler models and Chrysler is not doing a recall. I am seriously disappointed with Chrysler. This is the only vehicle I have wanted since I was a child. To finally be able to afford one was a dream come true. I brag about how wonderful my Jeep is, but now I feel embarrassed that its reputation is being tarnished by a company that does not support its product. If they do a recall, own up to it, I will feel more confident in recommending this vehicle. Until then Chrysler, shame on you.",1.0
"We purchased in February a 2012 Jeep Wrangler and started having problems with it - shutting off on us when driving. It has happened to us about 4 to 5 times. First, it had this red lighting type symbol on the dash so we took it to the Jeep dealer near our house. They could not get it recur so it was given back to us. It started again so we took it back to the dealer were we purchased it from. They kept it for a week to try to see what the problem was. They could find nothing so we got it back. 2 days later, it shut off when driving on incoming traffic. I am so terrified to even drive anymore so we took it back and they've had it for 2 weeks and can't seem to figure out what's causing it to do that. They have lied to us telling us they have contacted Chrysler. This is a safety issue, something has to be done. I have told them to get us out of it and they don't seem to want to help. I'm scared to drive it. We haven't had it long enough to even enjoy it.",1.0
"Since September of 2009, my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited has been having oil consumption problems. It's no leaking, not burning. It has been in/out of shop so many times I cannot count for the same problem. A star case was opened. Pistons/rings changed last summer. Still same problem occurred three more times. They are now telling me next step is new engine and they are following Chrysler guidelines. If this was in Sept. of 2009, wouldn't this be under Lemon Law? At that point, I only had the vehicle for 14 months. I have many friends who are also Jeep owners. They all tell me my Jeep runs like crap, rides like crap and there is something wrong with it! However, dealer keeps bringing me in for oil changes and fixing multiple things but yet never fixes the actual problem. My next step is phone call and letter to dealer, perhaps Chrysler.",1.0
"I have always been a fan of the Jeep Wranglers. I knew for sure that would be my next vehicle of purchase. And from what I have always been told, Jeep was a very good vehicle. So my decision was made when I passed the lot of Howard **. There she was, my 2012 Jeep Wrangler 4-door bright white princess. First off, I had to ask someone to come help me. I test-drove it and knew I'd be taking her home with me today. 
      Then came more problems. I bought the vehicle. Well, I wasn't informed on how to use anything. I noticed my USB port didn't work. But I was told it only worked with certain formats. So I believed them. I got home with no instruction manual in my glove compartment nor spare key!? So I called my salesman and had to leave several messages. And after a month, I received my manual. And 2 months after, the spare key came. But I noticed my batteries were going dead in my keys. Never hearing back on how I was liking my vehicle or even checking on our new purchase, I finally had enough whenever my malfunction light popped on and went in for a service check. After waiting 3 hours, I came to find out my radio had been broken the whole time. And they had to order me a new one. Okay, all was fine. I was driving home, and the satellite on my radio wouldn't play. After 2 hours of sending reconnection shoots, still it was saying subscription not available. At my wit's end, they found the problem. The radio ID had been changed to a different number. Well, up came the sun the next morning. I was driving to town, and I heard a bell, looked down, and there was my malfunction light looking up at me. I just busted out in tears! These are just a taste of problems I have had out of my brand-new jeep within my 6-month ownership! I have never had any problems out of my vehicles. This has really been an awful 1st-time experience jeep! I'm writing in hopes you'll step up to the plate and turn my frown upside down. I cannot handle much more. Not only did this vehicle cost us $45k, but it also cost me the gas and miles I have put on it driving to the dealership. I thought would be perfect for business. Thank you for responding to my complaint in advance.",1.0
"I am a rural letter carrier in Fairmount, Georgia. I recently purchased a pre-owned 2006 right hand drive jeep wrangler. I realize this is a vehicle that is just six years old; however, it was very low mileage and should hold up better than it has. When I purchased this vehicle it only had approximately 32000 miles on it. I currently have 59000 miles on it. But in the last year I have replaced bushing on the shifter at 38000 miles. The big thing was replacing the transmission at 45000 miles. In the last three months alone I have replaced a fuel sensor in the gas tank, an oxygen sensor and today I find out that my heater core is leaking and needs to be replaced. 
      Oh, I almost forgot my mechanic says the rear seal on the engine will need to be replaced eventually. Give me a break. I am a 52-year old single woman trying to make it on her own. I’m stuck with an unreliable vehicle that has become a money pit. I considered buying a new 2011 jeep wrangler last year, but they cost a small fortune. The pre-owned are like buying a new car themselves. So, yes, I am angry and disgusted. I would like to know if there is any type of compensation for any of the problems I have had. There should at least be one for the leak in the rear engine seal. I probably have as much chance of that as I do winning the lottery. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.",1.0
"I have a 2010 Jeep Wrangler that has been leaking very badly since I bought it. I have had it back to the dealer 9 times to try to fix it. I have bad mold growing in the car. I have to use an inhaler to drive it some days. My seat belt meet is soaked to the point I have to use a blow dryer to dry it so I can put it on. They can't fix the leaks. Also, my air bag is sticking out on the steering wheels and they still don't think that is a rush to fix. I can't even drive my kids around in this jeep. Between the mold and the air bag it's not a safety hazard.",1.0
"I am writing to you because I do not know where else to go with this. Something needs to be done by Chrysler and something fast before something serious happens to someone. I have a 2007 Jeep Wrangler 4 door Sahara and I am experiencing with it what is called the ""Death Wobble"", If you were to search about this on the internet, you will see I am not the only one that this is happening to. 
      I have called the dealership where I got the jeep and automatically they tell me that I need to have my stabilizer bar replaced and that it would cost me $250. I will tell you by all the complaints that I have seen on the internet that that will not fix the problem. I do not have the money to sink into this jeep for something that they say is going to fix it and it does not. What I experience when I hit a bump going about 50 is a violent shaking in the front end of my jeep to the point that I have to slow down to almost 20 mph to get it under control. I have also experienced it coming down a hill and when I put the brake on and the violent shaking happens again, but when I put the brake on to slow down it does worse. I am very scared to drive my jeep and I am afraid for my family and our lives in this jeep, when I use to love it. If this is a steering stabilizer problem then I think that Chrysler needs to take responsibility for this. I am sure if you ran a story about this, tons of people will come forward with the same thing. My mother in law has a 2009 jeep wrangler 4 door and the same thing is happening to hers. She has had new tires put on it, balanced, and an alignment. She has had it to the dealer twice and they tell her nothing is wrong with the jeep. My friend Tammy ** has 2007 Jeep wrangler 4 door and hers does it too. I am so tired of having a vehicle that I pay good money for and I am afraid to drive it. Here are some links to other complaints about the same problem. Please, please help me and others, before someone is seriously hurt or killed. Thank you so much!",2.0
"We bought a 2012 4-door wrangler, there was nothing wrong with the jeep. We purchased it in Dothan, Alabama and have had it for like 2 months. My son dropped something in the back and we were looking for it and we saw something shiny. My husband lifted up the floor boards and found a 2 ft plus machete! It had been used and sharpened before.
      I was hoping it was from when they were building the jeep or something! But that was so dangerous and my husband was furious because we live on a military base and my husband has a very high security clearance and we can get in big trouble for driving around with that!",2.0
"I asked to speak to Adam ** and was told that he would call me back within a day.  The person I talked to said that they would personally call me the next day to make sure that he called me--nothing!  Lee ** sold my wife and I a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited right-hand drive.  She works for the United States Postal Service, they never told us when we bought the jeep and that there would be no coverage on the tires.  At 10,000 miles, the tires were worn down to the ware bars evenly on all four tires.  Lee ** said that they can't cover it, Chrysler said they can't cover it.  Good Year said, ""No way, it's a postal vehicle.""
      Now, my question is on a vehicle that is supposed to be the off road king.  Going 20 miles an hour from mail box to mail box and two tires always on the pavement, why are all four tires evenly worn to the ware bars?  And why don't we have some type of coverage?  Then, we get a call from Lee ** trying to get off easy.  They told me that they would replace two tires, that's it.  I said, ""No way!""I'm done with Lee **.  Even Chrysler said that they would call me back.  It's been four weeks and nothing.  Some lady named Megan was supposed to call me.  I was told three times but there was nothing.  Now, the rest of the problems--the roof leaks, door leaks, center console had been replaced after the service writer told my wife that there is no overdrive button in the jeep.  Then, he had her show him where it was and when she showed him, he looked at her and said, ""You must have spilled something on it.I now have a $32,000 lemon.  They fixed the roof twice but it still leaks.  The radio doesn't hold time and the heater fan whistles after they looked at it twice.  Don't you think the salesman should have told me that they wouldn't cover the tires because of the fact that it was a postal vehicle?",1.0
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Wrangler about 2 years ago. I noticed that in between oil changes, or around 1500 miles, the oil light would come on. I always went to the auto shop and they would top off the oil. I was told by the mechanics and dealership that these engines are notorious for burning oil. On New Year's Day, I cranked up the Jeep and heard a horrible knocking in the engine, then it shut off. I checked the oil and it read zero, but the light had not come on to warn me this time. 
      Because of this, I had to buy a new engine and will be out around $5K, only to probably have the same problems again with the engine burning excessive oil. I have researched and have seen that many people have posted about this same problem. Jeep needs to recall these engines or pay for the replacements!",2.0

"My 2008 Jeep Wrangler purchased new, started having intermittent starting issues in September. Sometimes we could keep trying it and finally it would start, other times it required a jump, and still other times not even a jump would get it running. After replacing the battery ourselves we decided it was time to take it into the dealership where we purchased it, for diagnostics and service. 
      Since early September, the Jeep has been back to the dealer 4 times, towed in twice and has stayed there for more than 25 days. The dealer reports that they cannot duplicate/diagnose the problem and that ""It starts every time"" for them. We are just below the mileage cut off on our extended warranty and we are afraid to pick up our vehicle and exceed the mileage only to be told that ""now they might know what the problem is"". Another dealer in town cannot be reached to get a second opinion and we are ultimately at this dealers mercy. We decided to involve Chrysler only to increase our frustration in getting this matter resolved. We are now without a rental, without our Jeep, and without answers. Very dissatisfied overall.",1.0
"I purchased 2009 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited X 4 door w/ soft top on July 1, 2011. I noticed the smell when windows were up. After some investigation, I found it was the carpet. I ripped out the carpet and found standing water. I drained the water, and kept having water issues when it rained (which was more obvious without carpets). I found that it was leaking from the soft top. Since the end of September 2011, we have taken it to two different Jeep service centers, 4 different times and the leak is not fixed. I have asked Jeep customer service to replace the top, they say they can't help. 
      It is their ** product and it is they that need to fix this. We have a 2 year old, $25,0000 vehicle that is taking in water. We have to cover it with a tarp every time it rains and be without a vehicle. The vehicle is still under manufacturer warranty. The Service center keeps putting band-aids on it that aren't working. Jeep will not authorize anything else to be done. It is not beyond reason for Jeep to replace a faulty top. I see we are not the only ones complaining, or getting jerked around by Jeep over this soft top issue. Why has nothing been done thus far? Sadly, Jeep is no longer a quality name.",1.0

Now, I just got in my Jeep last night and there was water pooled in the back and it has shorted out my entire electrical panel. I have no speedometer, windshield wipers are stuck on full blast, no turn signals, no horn, no interior lights, etc. All because of a water leak, I assume.

Every time I pick it up, the repair order states that the Jeep has water leak, changed gaskets retested, leak fixed. As soon as the first rain hits the floor, it's soaked again. I am really getting annoyed with the explanation they give me. They stated that Jeep is aware of the problem and are trying to come up with a fix. At this point, if they don't have a fix, I would like a new vehicle. I have a small child and this is a major problem. I do know that when there is standing water, there is mold.

The dealer has had the Jeep for 2 1/2 weeks straight to try to fix the problem.  They changed part of the roof and several seals and told me that it still leaks.  They are replacing another seal and hoping that it works.  I am paying $30,000.00 for a Jeep that has been back to the dealership six times.

"I have purchased a 2002 Jeep wrangler with a 2.5 engine in 2006, with 28000 miles on it. The motor blew up at 110,000 miles. Apparently, this is a common thing for this motor. Everywhere I called it was the same thing. Why has Chrysler allowed this, knowing the problems it has with this motor? I always loved Chrysler products and even worked for a dealer for a while, but I will never again buy any product from this company.
      I work hard supporting my 2 children and money is tight and now I drive a $200.00 piece of junk while my Jeep sits in my driveway. Why hasn't there been any recall or at least make it right for the American consumer? Families have it hard enough making it, and when a big corporation like this as many others stick it to the hard working American family, it makes me wonder why to even by an American product anymore when our own companies treat us like dirt. It is truly a shame and is disgraceful.",1.0
"I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler.  I bought it to tow behind my 40' RV.  I put my own tow bar on.  I was towing the Jeep behind my RV in heavy rain.  The trail rated jeep was engineered/designed to forge 4' rivers when the brake lights went out.  The Jeep was completely dead now.  It wouldn't start.  Chrysler towed it in about 45 minutes from me calling them, telling them that my jeep is completely dead.  That was on August 16.  It is still at the five star dealer.
      I was waiting for TIMP or fuse box that fried in the rain.  The dealer said that it is because of my after market braking system (that worked for two years, that is hooked directly to the battery on a fusible link).  That's what caused the totally integrated power module (fuse box) to fry in a rainstorm two years after installation.  This is total nonsense.  I called Chrysler case management team.  It was a waste of time.   They stated that the dealer is part of them and what they say goes.  They won't give me an auto loan.  Not that I would want another Chrysler vehicle, it's just the fact that producing a junk vehicle and not standing by them is enough for me.  It cost me 500 dollars a month to pay for a dead vehicle.  Thank you Chrysler corporation.  I will always remember to buy Toyota.",1.0
"I know this will probably just get deleted, but I need to ""vent"". I bought a 2011 Wrangler in June but not before doing investigations online/forums/dealers about the changes that may be have been coming in 2012 model year. I was assured by more than one dealer that there had been talk of more horsepower/pentastar/engine upgrade in the automatic transmission to 5-speed, but that was just rumors and I could be certain there would be no changes. 
      Reluctantly, I bought hoping maybe in another 2 years, this would all come; not as soon as I walked out the dealership. I can't tell you how upset (furious) I was to pick up the new car and drive to see that, indeed, Chrysler did make the decision to go with the changes but decided not to let the dealerships in on it. I'm in sales and sort of understand the logic behind it because if this had been public knowledge, you would have a few thousand 2011 underpower POS sitting on the lot.

It only has 34,000 miles on it and it is acting up again like it did at the 18,000 miles when the starter didn't work. The service department says that it sounds like the starter, but since they can't duplicate the problem, they can't fix it. The minute I get it back, it acts up all over again. Their solution is that the next time it happens, call them and they will tow it into the garage. I am not sure what I'm supposed to do about getting to work on time or getting my son to preschool.

"In late June 2011, I bought a 2011 Jeep Wrangler in Charlotte NC from Keffer Jeep, located on Independence Blvd.  The second day I had it, one of the tires went flat as I was pulling out of my driveway. The sealant/adhesive between the tire and rim didn't hold due to poor craftsmanship at the factory where it was built.
      Less than a month later, I took a family vacation to western NY from Charlotte NC (about 1400 miles round trip).  While in NY, I noticed a squealing sound coming from the engine, like a loose fan belt. The Jeep had a serpentine belt system with a self-tightening pulley, so there shouldn't be any squealing from the belts.  Upon my return to Charlotte, I brought the Jeep back to the dealership and they said it needed an entire clutch and throw-out bearing. (The car only had 2500 miles on it.)  I was not give a loaner vehicle and spent over $100 on a car rental.A week later, the check engine light came on. I brought it back to the dealer again and they had to replace the Oxygen Sensor (02 Sensor).  I was not given a loaner vehicle again, and spent over $200 on a car rental. These all happened to a brand new vehicle before its first oil change.  I am a bit of a mechanic myself and when I changed the oil for the first time, I noticed it had too much oil in it. How is that possible? The guys at the factory put too much oil in it?  And the dealership didn't notice when they supposedly did two ""routine maintenance inspections"" while it was being fixed two different times?  That seems a bit odd to me.I bought this car for my wife.  We really wanted a four-door Jeep. I even had to have my brother co-sign to finalize the purchase.  And now I see that the dealership sold the vehicle to my brother (the co-signer), not me.  So, I am paying for a car that I can't drive and don't legally own.  But that's not the issue here. Just an aggravating factor.My wife drove this soft top four-door Jeep Wrangler as our primary family car.  She even had the family stick-figures in the back window representing Mom, Dad, our son and daughter and cat, which as a result promotes the four-door Jeep wrangler as a family car to a city with almost 1M residents. (There's no charge for that.)My wife won't drive the Jeep anymore and is now driving our 2000 Dodge Durango, which just happened to break down the same day the Jeep did.  I don't even want to look at the Jeep anymore, let alone drive it.  And I was so happy when we got it. I was very happy before all these happened.",1.0

Starting with the Beginning of the 2011year, the Jeep is now 2 yrs old and has less than 30,000 miles on it. My Husband, who had been maintaining my vehicle since day one, did an oil change at 26,000 miles. After the oil change about 2,000 miles, later as I was driving my jeep's engine decided to seize and just stop. (We had not changed products that'd we'd been buying since day one).
      My husband opened the hold, checked for leaks, there was nothing. He opened the oil pan and there was absolutely no oil in the engine at all. It was bone dry....2,000 miles after the last oil change. There had been no evidence of leaks or any puddles anywhere. I took it to Prince Frederick **, who gave me the explanation that ""It is customary that every new engine looses 1 quart of oil for every 1,000 miles"". Well, where did 5 quarts of oil disappear to? Their explanation for that was ""i dunno"" sometimes it just happens"". So with that...and us being a 2 car family, we had to leave my jeep at the dealership we bought it from for them to look at it. The dealership couldn't find any leaks and had no definitive explanation for the mysterious oil disappearance. They however did tell me that my jeep would need a complete engine replacement and that would be 4,000 dollars.So, I called Chrysler at the suggestion of the dealership because my jeep was still under warranty. Chrysler was of no help at all. Their answer was the same as the dealership "" It is customary that every new engine looses 1 quart of oil for every 1,000 miles"". My husband got on the phone with me and read my jeeps manual to ""Brian"" who then couldn't find the same page in his manual. Brian fumbled through some pages and ended with ""well, did you get your work done through the dealership"", No we didn't.....well then I can't help you because that voids your warranty. I said, no, it doesn't. It states in your manual that ""if you are competent and can do the work yourself, then do it""( not in the exact wordage, but you get the gist). My husband kept a ledger in my jeep of everything he's done to my vehicle. Chrysler would not accept this because Brian told us that anyone can make that information up and it's not real.He told us that we would have to provide ""Purchase Receipts"". I asked him to clarify what a purchase receipt is, being that we had a ledger with all the work done, he said that we would need to go to any store we went to get a receipt for the items we purchased to do the work. I said to him that purchasing something doesn't constitute the work actually being done and he said yes it does. I said, well I cannot name you one person that I know who saves their ""purchase"" receipts from oil changes, but that I can send him a copy of my ledger showing the work. He said he would not accept that. Brian then gave me a week to come up with the receipts and he called me back. I spoke to the stores in which we normally purchase our oil and they told me without knowledge of the exact date and/or method of payment, they wouldn't be able to pull up any information. Brian called like clock work and I told him the information I found out.He said he was sorry to hear that and that there was no other way to help me. That i'd have to pay for the new engine out of pocket and that Chrysler's product was not faulty. We needed transportation, so we had to do it. I gave the dealership the go ahead to fix my jeep and I called Brian back to discuss the possibility of even some partial assistance and he would not hear of it. Saying that because we were wrong in not spending money and taking the jeep to get serviced at their dealership and didn't save our purchase receipts that Chrysler was not at fault. He then told me there was one final thing we could try ""If I send him a copy of my work ledger, then he would forward that to his boss and discuss whether they would cover it. That is all that could be done and that he would call me back once they received everything"". He has yet to call me back.I have tried to call him and gotten no response. I've waited 4 weeks and I got a call from a lady doing a Chrysler corporation Survey. I was honest and told her everything. She said the conversation was recorded and she would forward this to headquarters. She did as she said and I received a call from ""Chelsea"". Chelsea called during my work hours on my cell phone and I cannot answer my phone at work. She left a message and said she would call again the next day. She called again at the same time. So this time I called her back and left a message letting her know my times of availability and numbers she could reach me at. She called the next day again at a time I could not be reached and her messaged she left said ""this would be the last time she would call and she was closing my case because she hadn't gotten a hold of me"". This is the last I have heard from Chrysler. I am out 4,000 dollars that I didn't have, which I ultimately had to take out a loan for and am now in debt because of this. I feel they need to reimburse me for the time I have spent being tossed from person to person and for my lost wages. I have lost faith in this company and am quite disappointed with their company quality, and consumer relations.",
"When going around the circle in Ocean City, NJ (slowly), my 2009 Jeep Wrangler started to wobble and jump. I lost control of the steering and was headed into oncoming traffic (mind you, with my 3 very young children in the back and my husband in the front). It is only by the grace of God that we are here to give this testimony! My husband chastened me for driving poorly (which I was not) and told me that I may have ruined the car. I have just learned that this is not at all uncommon and it actually has a name, the death wobble! We also are having trouble with the oil consumption in this vehicle, tt is always a quart low. This is not normal! We have been back and forth with the dealer and hopefully this will be remedied, along with the death wobble. Emotionally, I am now frightened that the death wobble will happen again and that my children will be in the car with me.",
"I was driving my 2010 Jeep wrangler sport, when all of a sudden I came out of a curve at 35mph and my Jeep started bouncing uncontrollably, throwing me into oncoming traffic. I was unable to steer and brake with a huge truck headed right at me. If there was not enough room for that truck to swerve of the road to go around me, we both would have no doubt been killed. The dealer said that I had a worn steering damper. I then found that there are many similar cases and that it actually has a name (the death wobble!). You would think that people should know about common defects like that before they purchase it.",
"I have the same problem as apparently, many other Jeep Wrangler owners. I have a 2007 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, and since I purchased it, it has stalled at highway speeds, about 5 times. These stalls do not last long, and the power comes back on, but it is quite frightening when it happened.  Recently, my whole electrical system shut down (not while driving), and I have been told it is the Totally Integrated Power Module. This is now going to cost me over $500, and I can't help wondering, if this has been the part that's been at fault all this time.  If the totally integrated power module is to blame, then it is about to cost me $525. Mild panic has also been a factor.",
"I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler with a manual transmission. In less than 1,000 miles, it has popped out of first gear nine times. There is no rhyme or reason. Up hill, down hill, flat, while turning. It happens on a regular basis. I have searched many forums and it seems to be a problem for many Wrangler owners. I say a recall is necessary. It has left me in stuck in oncoming traffic several times. I have only owned the Jeep two weeks.",
"My 2007 Jeep Wrangler is shaking so violently when I go between 40 and 55mph. It has scared me enough to take it to the dealer, only to find that my factory warranty ended 2 weeks ago. I am now fighting with Chrysler and the dealership as to who will be fixing the problem. I have looked online and found that many others are having a ""death wobble"" with their 2007 Jeep Wrangler 4 door. Please report this so a recall can be put into place before someone dies.",
"Part of  the front suspension rusted right off my car. It's six years old. I have not taken my Jeep off roading and I am a very leisure driver, ball joints are shot too? I have heard this to be a problem with the Libertys but not with the Wranglers. I live about five miles from work; it's easy when you have a car but when you rely on a bicycle, it's hard especially with the unpredictable weather. I love my car and do not intend to let it go.
      I also had my transfer case blow up/shatter on the highway a few years back; this was with three other passengers in the car including my younger brother. Everyone was safe, lucky. It seems like every six months or so, there is something new to fix on the jeep. I think so far I have spent around half of what I paid for the car and the car has only been in my hands for four years now. I invested in an American product patriotically but it seems like a total waste of my money.",
"I'm the owner of a 2006 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4.0 6 Cycle 6-speed with 41000 miles which is garage-kept since new, never off road, had a daily driver and in immaculate condition. On July 2,2010, while driving my daily commute to work, the engine started to have a slight miss in it. I was approximately 3 miles from work at the time and by the time I arrived, the engine was barely running. It had valve train noise, misfiring and was burning excessive fuel. I called Adams Jeep in Aberdeen, MD for advise and was told it was probably the distributor drive gear. He knew the problem immediately. I had the vehicle towed there the next day, July 3, 2010.
      The vehicle was looked at on July 5, 2010 and I was told it would need a distributor drive and the repair would cost in the $500 price range. I okayed them to order the part. A week later, I inquired as to the situation and was told that the part was currently on backorder from Chrysler and would not be available until August 9. I contacted Chrysler to find out the reason. I was told by Adams that 40 of the drives were on backorder. I filed a customer complaint #19705149 based on the fact that in 2005 there was a technical service bulletin for the same complaint. My vehicle was built using the leftover parts from 2005 and should be covered for this repair. After many calls to Chrysler and 9 weeks later my jeep is still sitting at Adams Jeep and now I have to pay them to tear apart my engine for diagnostic reasons to see what else has been damaged by this defective distributor drive. Chrysler has never returned my calls. They offer to pay half of my bill but I feel that it should be their responsibility to pay all of it. Their defective $20 part has now done thousands of dollars in damage to my engine.",
"I have a 2009 Jeep Wrangler x that I purchased new.  The driver’s side seat has already been replaced and now it needs again and the passenger seat as well.  The jeep was taken to the dealership in January and they ordered both seats.  7 months later, we are still waiting for the seat covers to come in.  When I spoke to the claims representative on this, he stated they should be in by August the 10th.  I told him this was unacceptable and he said it was all he could do.  I told him that they make Jeeps every day and that a seat cover should not be hard to get.  And I told him that if this is how Jeep handles the warranty work, then I will not buy another Jeep and I will probably trade it off for a new Chevy.  I also told him I would take it to a car show or Jeep event and hang signs up, telling them about Jeep and how their reps handle issues.  He stated go ahead and do what you got to do.",
"Owner of a 2008 4 door jeep Wrangler. We were 123 miles from home when our jeep shut down completely. A smell came from the engine that smelled like a chemical or sulfuric burn? After being stuck on a Sunday in a town with no jeep dealership. We had it towed 20 miles back to Albany, OR to the only jeep dealership Mark Thomas Motors. With no chance of getting a rental car and our jeep wouldn't even start, we borrowed a car from family and drove 123 miles home across a mountain pass to Bend,OR leaving the jeep behind in a parking lot of the said dealership.
      Monday morning, we called to explain what happened and they informed us that the jeep started right up and they can't imagine why it did or even try and find out why? Our jeep shut down completely with no ability to stop or turn the steering wheel or any warning it was going to happen? If we would have already entered the mountain pass and this had happened there would have been tragic results with the narrow winding roads. Now begins the real issue. There was a recall on a transmission problem so decided while it's there and since we are taking my son 1300 miles to college next month that we have it fixed. After talking to 3 service dept., workers yesterday telling us nothings wrong with the jeep and the recall is a simple fix and it will be done by 9am. The next day we got up and called before traveling the 123 miles to pick it up and got the manager of the service dept. who laughed at us telling him we were told to pick it up by 9am and that this is the first he has heard of the smell that came from the engine when it shut down or replacing the recall part? And he would get to it when he wanted? As a manager of a very successful business myself paying over $28,000 for my Jeep i cannot fathom as to why one would treat us the way he did about something that is initially his responsibility. Informed us he wouldn't take time out of his day to call us and update us on the status of our Jeep? When and where does Chrysler step in and assure us owners of your product that we will get the customer service we have already paid for?My Jeep is under warranty for another year and even after that I have a lifetime power train limited warranty? Which I'm beginning to believe, actually makes it harder to get to the bottom of the problem because the service dept is at makes nothing off of their time spent fixing the actual problem? As a result, I will be looking to trade my Jeep in for something that at least has people with integrity working behind them? Sad for Jeep because it used to be all American vehicle. Not anymore with the service providers they have behind them?",

"I own a 2007 Jeep Wrangler Sahara. I have had problems with this car from day 1. It first had esp problems and they put a new computer chip in. Then It had a severe front end problem that I took it to three different dealerships, only to have all of them tell me they didn't find anything wrong with it. They told me to buy new tires, with I did, then a front end alignment-- I did that too, and still the car had the same thing! 
      Needless to say after two years, I finally found out it has ""The Death Wobble."" I'm out a few hundred of dollars, all the time off work. I finally told the dealership what I had then and only then did they fixed it! This is a very serious problem! I live on a mountain so I had to deal with this every day! I'm upside down on my loan so I can't get rid of it! Why hasn't anyone told me about it?",
"2007 Jeep Commander. Suddenly, all control lights come on, engine stalls for a couple of seconds, everything back to normal. Days, weeks, month --no problem. Then suddenly, it comes back. The dealer did software update, waiting for more bulletins. No notification of any further recall since 2008. Shall we burn the vehicle to kill the hidden secret computer bugs? Our Jeep history: 2 Willis 50s, Jeep Wranglers 4, Laredo 3, Commander 1. Since the 1987 purchase, Jeep quality goes downhill with little or no help from the factory! We feel sorry for the dealer's helpless, costly repair action victims. It is time for a class A lawsuit. The previous Daimler, intermediate and now Fiat company owners refuse to fix the real cause of the stalling problem.",
"I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler 4 x 4 right hand drive. I bought it used with 24,000 miles. It has a no start issue. Never know when it is going to do it, turn key and it just clicks. Mineola Dodge house has replaced the starter, the solenoid, and the modual. But it still does it intermittently. I finally got a look at the VIP and it was a buy back. No one disclosed this to me when I bought it. The service and mechanics can't figure out what the problem is. They say because it won't do it on command. However they have got to experience it a couple of times. I went by the service bay on a regular basis. 
      I have met three others that own the same year and right hand drives (for postal delivery) and they are experiencing the same problems. Why can't anyone tell us anything other than they don't know what to do? My job depends on my vehicle. I cannot afford to loose my job because of continued vehicle problems. When I called Chrysler, they told me to take it back to the dealer I bought it from. I told them I bought it used they then told me to go to my service guys. Once again, they don't know what to do. Can I force Jeep to buy it back again?",
"I bought a 2004 Jeep Wrangler X in 2006. About a month after buying it, ""death wobble"" began. It took a while for me to learn how to duplicate it, but it seems to happen when I approach 50 mph, either accelerating or decelerating. If I keep it at that certain speed, the wobble gets worse and worse. The last time it happened, I had to slow down quickly from about 70 mph. As soon as it hit 50 mph, it started to wobble violently and I lost control and about went off the road. It's almost caused several wrecks for me.
      At first, the dealer told me it was the rotors, even though I told them it happened when I wasn't using the brakes. Then, they told me my air pressure wasn't right, which it was. Finally, after several months, they determined the front end caster alignment was not in specification and installed and offset ball joint. After a few months, it happened again and they said the front stabilizer shock was weak. They replaced the front stabilizer shock and a new steering damper. The wobble went away. Now, after about 7 months, it's happening again and their remedy is to replace the steering damper again. I'm not under warranty and can't afford to keep doing this. I have contacted Jeep/Chrysler and even filed a complaint with my attorney general just to get all of this on record. I'm sure the service department is doing all they can, but there seems to be something inherently wrong with the front end of this Jeep. After doing a search online, I have found that this is happening to thousands and thousands of Jeep owners. The same problem and no fix. So, is Jeep/Chrysler going to wait until a lot of people get killed to recall this? Or should I say class action lawsuit?",
"My 2007 Jeep Patriot makes a noise when driving. At first I thought it was just my tires whirring on the road. As it got worse, I took it to Champion Jeep in Lansing, MI. I have owned it for less than 3 years and there are 49,000 miles on it. The dealership informed me that it was no longer under warranty and needed the transmission replaced, $3648.00 my cost. I told them I realize it’s not under warranty any longer, but regardless, a transmission should last longer than this. The dealership agreed but said there was nothing they could do about it. I called customer service and filed a complaint. The next day, Brian called me back and said they would replace it, but I had to pay $1500.00. I said that’s not acceptable. They need to back their product. Then I asked to speak with his supervisor. I did get a call back that day from another Bryan. He was very condescending towards me. He said their decision stands. I told him I am a good customer since I have my Patriot along with my 2 Jeep Wranglers and my son just got his license and we are shopping for him a Wrangler also. He agreed I was a good customer, but this was his best offer. I told him that he knows this is wrong, they need to repair it for free. Even the dealership said it was a manufacturer’s defect and that I did nothing to cause it. Oh, and it just needs a part replaced, but Chrysler decided not to sell that part so that is why it needs a whole new transmission. 
      I ask Bryan #2 for his supervisor. He said she was there for administrative purposes only and doesn’t speak with customers. He offered me the Board of Directors’ address, informed me that this offer is only good for 30 days. I said, “Let me guess, they will get back with me just past the 30 days?” He said he didn’t know if they would actually get back with me, but he knows they do read every letter. I asked again for someone higher than him to speak to, he said there is no one higher than him. I’m considering contacting an attorney. I have never been this upset before. I’m a single mother. I bought a new vehicle to avoid costly repairs. My jeep makes a loud whirring sound when it’s being driven. I am still making payments on this thing, plus I will have to pay the $1500.00 to replace it. I am appreciative that they are working with me, but I don’t have $1500.00",
My 2010 Jeep Wrangler Sahara has the worst headrests ever placed in a vehicle. They do not support one's head and they are cheap solid vinyl type material. They angle forward and a sharp edge digs into the back of your skull. The factory and the dealer were of no help and there are not swaps or replacements for these headrests. This safety item is very important and these cheap ill-fitting rests are useless and can actually cause injuries. I will have to revamp them with dense foam or find a swap replacement from another auto manufacturer. This is poor design!,
"I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler and the AC stopped working. I took it into the dealership and they told me that the AC did not work because the condenser was damaged due to impact, a rock kicked up from the road and went through the grill and hit the condenser and this would not be covered by the warranty. The issue is that the front grill on a Jeep is an open design and the condenser is directly behind it with no protection.
      I called Chrysler and told them I felt that the warranty should cover the poor design, of course I was told no. So every time a rock hits the front of the Jeep and damages the condenser, I get to buy a new one. I do understand that this is not a mechanical defect but it is a design flaw and should be addressed by Jeep. The cost that was quoted to me by Chrysler was $814 + tax and shop supplies.",
"I bought (paying on) a 2008 Wrangler Unlimited X. The Jeep had 18 miles on it. 2-3 months after buying the jeep, the roof has leaked. 10 months after the complaint, a pillar was fixed along with the rag top. I moved to Washington State in November 09 and here we go again. A pillar and B pillar were leaking water. My jeep has this ongoing leak for over a year. My Jeep smells like mildew/moldy and Chrysler still does nothing but tell me to call district manager of Washington (who told me to get a lawyer again). I sued Chrysler over the 3,000 miles I put on my jeep driving it to the dealership once to twice a week for 10 months.
      So, here we are again with the moldy/mildew smell and more leaks. I am quoting what a Chrysler employee told me, “It's a jeep rag top it’s going to leak water.” I've owned corvettes that never leak. Anyways, the A pillar was the lawsuit and now A&B both leak.",
"I have a Jeep Wrangler 4dr unlimited X that I ordered when I saw those ads for the jeep. After being told that I would take only 2 months to complete, well, it took almost 4 months for them to finish and even then they stated it was dropped off at wrong location. So the first snow in Virginia I went to place in 4wd and noted that the jeep would not move. I took it back out of 4wd and still nothing. I had to tow it to local Jeep shop. I was told Jeep installed a cable wrong.
      So at 20,000 miles, I had the ""Death Wobble"" on I81. I was able to stop the vehicle somehow but had a 18 wheeler blowing his horn and almost hit us. I took the Jeep to shop and they stated because I placed a 3 inch suspension lift that is what caused it. I had the lift gone over with a rep from BDS and noted no problems. Jeep replaced the stabilizer and stated that fixed the problem. They never even test drove the vehicle after the repair. I took the Jeep to the Jeep Doc here and he stated that I needed a larger stabilizer to only get rid of that wobble to a certain point. He was right but still at 55, it shook like a quake. So back to the dealer, they took the Jeep in and then told me I had 3 bad tires that it had nothing to do with the lift. Kind of weird they change their story. The way I see it, Jeep doesn’t want to back their product even if out of warranty. Just like my radio. It has been replaced twice and needs a new one but service manager stated that they could not replace for free out of warranty.",
"The problem with my vehicle is with the warranty work that should be covered by the factory warranty. I own a 2008 Jeep Wrangler (Rubicon model). Here is a brief history of the vehicle:
      At around 10,000 miles, the Jeep developed squeaky throw out bearing in the clutch. The Jeep was taken to the dealership it was purchased at (Medved in Wheat Ridge) and the warranty was honored with the repair being completed in a day or two. At 12,000 miles, I was on a trail in Colorado and got stuck in a snow drift, with axles locked the u-joints in the front axle failed causing the axle yoke to break. The vehicle was limped off the trail and 5-10 miles to the nearest town. Jeep roadside assistance was called and the vehicle was towed to the same dealership. The incident was explained and an inquiry was made about warranty coverage. The service department claimed that the Jeep had been abused because they could tell that the vehicle had been off road, thus, it was not going to be covered under warranty. After a day of arguing, I accepted that it was not going to be a warranty issue and did not want to have the repairs done by the dealership. I retrieved the jeep, ordered axles and installed them in the garage in about 3 hours. Sadly, I have not been on a trail in the Jeep since.A few months ago, I was having regular maintenance performed at GO Jeep in Golden Colorado. They found that during my visit to Medved regarding my broken front axle, the Chrysler representative and the dealership blackballed my Jeep from any coverage offered by the factory warranty citing abuse of the vehicle (I was not informed of the discontinuance of the warranty by Medved). Now, the entire vehicle warranty is void. While discussing the situation with GO Jeep, they were able to talk to the Chrysler representative and get the vehicle covered on a case by case basis.At around 27,000 miles, the fuel tank began to overflow whenever it was filled up (a bad vent line in the filler neck). I took the Jeep in at 31,000 miles (work took me and the jeep to Montana and about 2,200 miles the previous month) and they agreed to change the fuel fill line under warranty. Two days later, the clutch went half way to the floor before catching (I had driven it the day before and was fine). I called the dealership and told them, they said to bring it in. The problem was a leaking slave cylinder in the bell housing saturating the clutch with hydraulic fluid. I asked if it would be covered under warranty and the dealership said that it should be. While trying to get the repair approved, the Chrysler representative told them that this vehicle cannot be repaired under factory warranty and not to call about this vehicle ever again. After explaining the situation to the service manager, he attempted to get the repairs approved and could not. He did the repairs for $500.00 less than quoted because of the situation. However, I still paid $1,200.00 for a repair I feel should have been covered by warranty. The issues I have been having with my Jeep should have been covered by the warranty with no questions asked. The slave cylinder and the fuel tank have nothing to do with a broken U-Joint. Due to the warranty being voided, I have no warranty on any problems with the vehicle, mechanical or not. If Chrysler felt that it needed to void a warranty, a note should have been made that the front axle is no longer covered but the rest of the vehicle should still be covered. Due to this issue, I have paid for repairs and I fear I will not receive the appropriate trade in value for the vehicle. Chrysler customer service is unable to help with the issue and the district manager will not contact me.",
"My 07' Jeep Wrangler has stalled on me 5 to 6 times in three years with the dealer, which is now out of business, not resolving the problem. The last time it occurred, we were driving on a slightly downward slope on Garfield Ave. city of of Commerce, when the car stalled and three cars avoided me from behind.
      We have called and sent letters to Chrysler, but to no avail. They keep asking to take it in at our expense, but we are done with that. We have showed good faith and honored our contract. Chrysler does not understand the magnitude or severity of this problem.",
"I have a 2006 Jeep Wrangler Right Hand drive, built and sold for Mail Delivery to USPS employees only. This vehicle has had repeated problems starting at 4000 miles. Every time I have taken it to be fixed, the repairs have been blamed as a result of delivery of mail, which it was advertised and sold for. My AC control has been replaced more than 4 times, my transmission went out less than 1000 miles out of warranty. I had asked Chronic to check this transmission on two separate occasions while under warranty and they found no problems. 
      My molding surrounding my front windshield has been replaced 2 times and is hanging down now as a result of sloppy workmanship. The door knob which they replaced is coming out again, because it was not properly fixed. The part that holds the door strap on was damaged at the dealership and I told them about this, they said it was not and would not fix this. They have not shown the ability to fix this vehicle properly or diagnose problems which they should be able to do. I have missed multiple days from work as a result of this vehicle being undependable to do the job it was built for. I have had to replace a transmission in a vehicle with less than 40K miles on it out of my finances. I have asked that Chrysler, reimburse the expenses of the transmission to me which they have denied. I have also requested a buy back or replacement at the suggestion of a customer rep who I spoke with at Chrysler. They have also denied this. I feel that this dealership and Chrysler have a responsibility to their customers to stand behind their warranties and products without being nasty to their customers. The dealership has been very ugly about the service provided to me, because I deliver mail out of this vehicle. This has been stated each time I have had a problem with the vehicle. Lorna and Marty are very unprofessional and need to learn than when the company provides a vehicle to do a service, the warranty still applies.",
"On Sunday December 20th 2009 at 4:00, my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited with 12,000 miles on the odometer ""died"" on Interstate 17, 45 minutes south of Flagstaff AZ. This is the middle of nowhere, along with my husband and me were our 17 month old son, 4 year old daughter, our dog and luggage. We were renting a cabin outside of Flagstaff (2 and a half hours from our Tempe, AZ home) until December 24th. We had the Jeep towed to Planet Jeep in Flagstaff AZ where it remains today awaiting repairs. It seems that due to faulty manufacturing, the vehicle requires a new engine along with several other parts. The repairs are 100% covered by warranty. 
      How long will this take? No one seems to know. It's already been a month. In the interim, we have had to rent a vehicle which Jeep should be paying for. They are responsible for manufacturing a faulty product which had caused my family a tremendous inconvenience. We were approved for a rental car for 12 days and after the 12 day period, we were informed by Planet Jeep that in order to have the rental extended, we, the consumers, would have to call Jeep (Chrysler Corp) directly. It took 4 phone calls to finally get Brandon (this is the only person who has the authority to approve rental reimbursement) to speak with me. He approved an additional 7 days of vehicle rental. He could not possibly approve vehicle rental until the repairs were complete. We were told to call back, which we did. We left messages. We asked to speak to a supervisor and were told that one would call back, they never did. We are at the mercy of these incompetent **. Honestly, all I wanted was my rental car paid for while my Jeep was being repaired.",
"I have a 2004 jeep wrangler. I have replaced the window actuator and motor in the front left door. Now I am replacing the back window actuator. There is a problem with the design. After looking on the internet and seeing how many people have had problems, I wanted to voice my problems.",
"The motor in my 2007 Jeep Wrangler JK failed. According to the dealer, it was the rod bearings that failed. I provided Chrysler with copies of all of my service records, proving that I had performed the regular maintenance as required. The dealer could not determine what caused the bearings to fail. The car is only 2 and 1/2 years old, but it has 48K miles (12K miles over the warranty period). I called Chrysler customer satisfaction line and opened a case with them. After two weeks, they finally came back and told me that they were not going to cover the cost of the new motor as a warranty and the most they would be willing to do is reimburse me for 50% (the bill is over $5,000).
      When I called the dealer, Lincoln informed me that Chrysler had instructed the dealer to cover the repair under the dealer's warranty. The dealer, Manassas Chrysler Jeep, decided not to cover the repairs. According to Lincoln, covering my motor would have used one of their ""warranty tickets"" and that would have limited their ability to perform warranty repair work for the people who bought their cars from that dealer. There is a lot more detail to this, but this is the general story. Bottom line is that when you pay over $30K for a car, you expect the motor to last more than 2 and 1/2 years and 48K miles. I have to come up with over $5,000 in order to get my Jeep back.",
"I own a 2008 Jeep Wrangler that we bought new. At around 23,000-24,000 miles, it started shaking so bad I thought it was falling apart. This happened every time I would drive over some railroad tracks or sometimes cracks in the road. My husband contacted the dealer we bought it from. They stated that they had no idea what was wrong with it. My husband had them replace the steering box, this did not help. My husband put on heavy duty shocks, this still did not help. I contacted Chrysler. The customer service person stated that she turned it over to a manager and I would be contacted within 1 day. 
      A week later, I called back. Brian had logged that he had tried to contact me three times. Brian did not try to contact me. The one number that I gave him was my cellphone that I can always answer. I left Brian a voice mail and again gave him my phone numbers. Two days later, I called back again. The customer service person stated he would call me back yet today. Needless to say, I have not heard from him.After contacting some Jeep owners, I found out my Jeep has what is called ""Death Wobble."" I guess this is common in a lot of Jeeps. They stated there is no one thing that can be done. Several different things are usually tried. If it is such a known problem, shouldn't the dealers make consumers aware of what could possibly happen? Nobody seems to want to help me! I'm terrified to drive it. I'm constantly thinking I'm going to go in the ditch or to the other lane of traffic. Would you please help me with this problem?",
"When I bought my 2008 Jeep Wrangler, there was a noise that I thought was common on a rugged vehicle. About a month later, I tried going out and the clutch was extremely loose feeling, almost like it would fall apart. So I drove it back home very cautiously. I waited for the next morning to see if the problem was still there. It was. A very noticeable feeling. I had it towed in. The dealership said nothing wrong with it. When I picked it up, it drove fine. I haven't had the problem since. However, the loud, tapping, clangy noise (kinda sounds like something is extremely loose) just keeps getting worse. The engine oil keeps getting dark fast, refilling in between oil changes, out a few times dark smoke, just above the oil release cap looks like there might be oil or something dark in the cracks (is it the bell housing?). I don't know.
      The Jeep dealerships have told me that all of this is normal and they cannot find any problems with my Jeep. I told them (and this is so true) that people keep telling me that there is something very wrong with my Jeep and I should have it looked at. This noise that I hear is very loud and sounds like something is going to fall apart, very loud when accelerating. How do they not hear this? Why do they keep pushing me away? I am almost thinking about letting my Jeep go (it is financed through Chrysler Financial). I paid a nice penny in my eye for my Jeep. I work hard for my Jeep and I deserve better! PS: It popped out of the third gear one day! I also remember not test driving this vehicle (I test drove a different one, an automatic).",
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Wrangler on 4/14/09. It was a gift from my uncle and the sale price of $16,504 plus tax and title fees was paid in full. Three weeks later (on 5/10/09), the vehicle caught on fire while I was driving it (fire started under hood). Only the frame remained by the time fire fighters put out the fire. Vehicle had less than 30,000 miles and was less than three years old. 
      When Geico Insurance Company refused to cover loss (vehicle had proper liability as well as collision coverage with Geico), I filed a warranty claim with The Chrysler Group, LLC. Chrysler did inspect the vehicle and refused to cover loss. Chrysler stated that they found no apparent defects. However, vehicle was burned and nothing remained except the frame of vehicle. Several mechanics I have spoken to state that any defects would be nearly impossible to identify due to the extent of fire damage to the vehicle. I did file a complaint with the Attorney General Bureau of consumer frauds and protection division in Syracuse, NY. I am presently waiting for a response from them. However, I have since learned of several recalls on the 2007 Jeep Wranglers, including one recall with the 2007 (3.8 liter engine; same engine that was in my wrangler). This particular recall was due to many complaints of vehicle catching on fire. I need to contact the fraud division and be sure they are aware of this recent news regarding a defect that can cause the vehicle to catch on fire.",
"I lease a 2007 Jeep Wrangler 2-door 4x4. This vehicle is unsafe. The power fails during driving and it stalls. This has happened on highways and main roads. It is only a matter of time before this problem causes an accident and people are hurt or killed. The car has been in the shop for a total of 32 days due to this problem, and I have missed more than a week's worth of work.
      February 12, 2008: I was driving to work from Hoboken, NJ to Montclair, NJ on an 11-degree day. I drove 40 minutes, some on highway. While on the highway, the radio went off and lights flashed on and off. Approximately one mile from work, all lights flashed on, car began shaking, the power steering and brakes stopped working, and then the car stalled. It would not turn back on. I called AAA. I waited in the cold for 1.5 hour. When the tow truck arrived, the car started again. I drove to the dealership in Verona, NJ. I received a ride back to work from a colleague. I arrived to work 3 hours late. Verona dealership hooked the car up to the computer and stated nothing was wrong with the car. It was returned to me with no repairs made.February 13, 2008: I brought the car to the Manhattan Service Center at 4,256 miles for the problem. I had to get a ride to work from a colleague. The service center (Rick/David) found nothing wrong with the car but performed a recall (#G40). They told me it should solve the problem that caused the power failure and stall. January 15, 2009: I was driving to work on a cold, snowy day from Huntington, NY to St. James, NY. After 30 minutes of driving, the lights flashed on, car seemed to have less pick up, and the radio went off. Minutes later, the car began to shake and gas gave it no power. I lost power in steering and brakes as well. I drifted into a snowbank on the side of Edgewood Avenue in Smithtown, NY next to a busy school driveway. It would not restart. Jeep Roadside would not tow. I called AAA. I had to renew membership. I waited in the freezing cold and snow for 1 hour. When tow truck arrived, it still would not start. I had to call the boss to pick up from Smithaven dealership. Smithhaven dealership told me they would not look at car for over four days. I called the dealership in Huntington, NY. Dawn agreed to look at the car immediately if towed there. I had the car towed to Huntington dealership at 28,096 miles. I was three hours late to work.January 16, 2009: I got a ride to work from a colleague. I called Dawn at the service center for an update before the weekend. She stated they would have a better idea on Monday.January 20, 2009: I spoke to Dawn again. She stated that they didn't know what was wrong with the car, but based on the information available, they would replace the wireless control module. The part was on backorder. She also stated that the brake pads were thin and should be replaced. It's not covered by warranty, so they would have to charge me for that maintenance. I requested a loaner car, since the wireless control model could be over a week. The service center refused. I got a ride home from work from a colleague.January 21, 2009: I got a ride to work from colleague. I called for another update. Dawn stated the part could take 2+ weeks to arrive. I restated my request for a loaner car. I called Chrysler Customer Assistance. After explaining that I had no means of transportation to work and that my car would be in the shop for more than a week, I was granted a loaner car. I got a ride to Huntington service center from a friend to pick up the loaner car.January 31, 2009: I picked up the car. I was charged $271.52 for brake pad replacement. I was assured the Wireless Control Module replacement would solve the problem with the car.February 19, 2009: The car stalled while driving through NYC at about 20 mph. I restarted immediately. Car would not start when turned off at gas station just outside Holland Tunnel in NJ. Another patron at the gas station was kind enough to help by jumping the car. Car ran after jump.March 3, 2009: I was driving to work in St. James, NY after a weekend in NJ in snowy and cold conditions with a new puppy. At 7:00am, about one hour into the drive while on Long Island Expressway, the radio went off, lights flashed on and off, and the car began to shake and lose power. I pulled off the nearest exit, and it stalled as I coasted into a gas station. After about 15 minutes, the car started again, and I tried to drive it to the Huntington Service Center about 8 miles away. The car would not drive over 25 mph, and after about two miles, it began to shake uncontrollably. I pulled into a parking lot, put the car in neutral, and tried revving the engine. Nothing changed and the car stalled. I waited in the cold and snow for AAA to tow me to the Huntington Service Center at 29,295 miles. I waited at the service center with the puppy, because I had no means of transportation to work. Service advisor Brian communicated to me that the car had nothing wrong with it based on the computer check and that a technician would take it for a test drive with me. The problem didn't happen on the test drive. Upon return to the service center, I insisted that they continue to search for the problem on the grounds that my car had to be towed in after losing control on the highway. The service manager refused. I asked him to explain Chrysler's responsibility in the matter, and he said in an unkind tone that I could go to arbitration but the problem would have to occur in front of the arbitrator, so it probably wouldn't work in my favor. I became visibly upset and told him that I felt unsafe driving the car because of the recurring power problem. He told me that he would do nothing further to help me. I asked him if he had a daughter with the intention of drawing a comparison to how my father must feel about me driving an unsafe vehicle. He simply answered no and walked away. I missed a full day of work. I spoke to Bobby at the Huntington Sales Center about the possibility of trading my Jeep Wrangler in. He was sympathetic to the problem, but when he calculated the costs, he said it would not be worth it but would contact me if any specials came up.March 4, 2009: I returned to the service center at 29,308 miles, because the dashboard lights were going on and off while I was driving. I insisted that they find out what was wrong with the car and fix it. Dawn told me that they would call the Chrysler Tech Support Team to help with solving the problem. I called Chrysler Customer Assistance from the Service Center and spoke to Alan to authorize another rental car. I was 30 minutes late for work. I contacted Bobby again, who said he would check on the car in the afternoon.March 5, 2009: I called the Service Center to check on the progress. Dawn stated that the problems caused on March 3 and March 4 were because the battery was low and the ESP was activating prematurely. She stated the low battery was causing the power failure and the ESP was causing the shaking of the car. She stated that the service center would replace the battery and fix the module that controls the ESP.March 6, 2009: I picked up the car. I was assured by the service manager that the problem was now resolved once and for all. April 17, 2009: I was driving from NY to NJ. While on Long Island Expressway, I hit a bump, and the steering wheel and car began to shake. I had to grip the steering wheel to keep from driving into another lane.April 19, 2009: I was driving back to NY from NJ. While entering the Northern State Parkway, the steering wheel and car began to shake again. Again, I had to grip the steering wheel to keep the car from shaking into another lane. I called the service technician, who said the shaking was not going to cause the car to break down but that I should bring it to the service center.April 22, 2009: While driving upstate to a consulting job, I hit a bump on the Palisades Parkway. The car began to shake again, and I had to grip the steering wheel. April 23, 2009: I brought the car to the Manhattan Service Center and test-drove with technician David. The problem did not recur. He sent me away with the car. While driving back to Long Island on the Long Island Expressway, the steering and car began to shake again.July 15, 2009: While driving, the car hit a bump and began to shake a little. Dashboard lights dimmed, and the car continued to run. I called Manhattan Jeep Chrysler Dodge to request information about terminating my lease. I spoke to Star. She explained that if I turned in the car, the remainder of the payments and a turn-in fee would be due immediately, unless I made a payment plan with Chrysler Financial. We calculated the total as $2863.25. And I spoke to David, the General Sales Manager at Manhattan Jeep Chrysler Dodge. He was sympathetic to the problem and agreed that it was unsafe to drive my car. He was also appalled at how the Huntington Service Center treated me. He urged me to bring the car to the Manhattan Service Center, so they could fix the problem.July 17, 2009: At 31,022 miles, I took a day off work to go to Manhattan Jeep Chrysler Dodge. I went first to the general manager at the sales center. He restated his agreement that the car was unsafe and sent me to the service advisor at the Service Center to help me. After examining the service history in his computer records and the hard copy records I brought with me to the service center, Rick was very understanding of the problem, agreed that the car was unsafe, and said he would have his technician look at it. He also stated that if the car could not be fixed, Chrysler would buy it back from me.I called Chrysler Customer Assistance to 1) complain about the continuing and dangerous nature of the problems with my car, 2) complain about the poor treatment at the Huntington Service Center, and 3) to get a loaner car. I was granted a loaner car.July 24, 2009: Rick called to tell me the car was ready after they replaced the Power Control Module per the factory team in Detroit. They also changed one tire to solve the problem with shaking. July 25, 2009: I picked up the car at 10am on Saturday. When asked what would happen if the problem occurred again, I was told that the repair was guaranteed for 12 months. July 27, 2009: While driving to vacation in New Jersey, lights dimmed and came back on again. August 1, 2009: While on vacation in Geneva, New York, the car shook and stalled while clutch was engaged. Restarted.August 7, 2009: I brought car back to Manhattan Service Center. Rick ** was on vacation. Spoke to Service Manager Bob **, who said he had a headache. He stated that the car was unsafe and they would have to fix it through Detroit. I asked what I could do about voiding the lease and he said nothing could be done. I told him Rick ** stated Chrysler would have to buy the car back and Bob said I could go to arbitration by looking at the procedure in the owners manual. He also stated that since my car had been in seven times for the same problem, they didn't have a leg to stand on. I told him my manual had been stolen. He said he might be able to find one by next week. I told him I would go to the Sales Center and request another. He also provided me a loaner car.August 7, 2009: I met with David the General Manager who reiterated that my car is unsafe and unfit to drive. He called Bob, the Service Manager, and implored him to help me out. Bob replied that he had found an owner's manual. I asked David if he had any resources to help me void my lease, and he said no, because it was corporates responsibility, since they owned the car once I leased it.August 7, 2009 (3:56-4:15pm): I called Chrysler Customer Service. I spoke to Destiny. I explained the recurring problem with my car and how unsafe it is and asked her to direct me to someone who could help me terminate my lease. She retyped a new case and transferred me to Chrysler Financial. There I spoke to Susan **. She told me that she was unable to retrieve cases from Chrysler Corporation because they are actually completely separate business entities. I asked to speak to her supervisor. She transferred me to Sean, her account manager who told me that I would not be able to void my lease because I have signed a contract that requires me to keep the vehicle. When I explained that they were not upholding their end of the contract because I have a faulty vehicle, he told me that I needed to talk to Chrysler Customer Assistance. I explained that I already had, but he refused to help me further.August 7, 2009 4:23-5:06pm: I called Chrysler Customer Service a second time. I spoke to Roy and gave him the case number. He said that before anything could happen, Chrysler would have to send an expert team to look at the car. He called Bob to see what sort of procedure they were following at the Manhattan Service Center and left him a message. He then called Chrysler Financial for me to see what would be the procedure for voiding my lease. I was connected to Diana, who made it all seem so easy. She said I should voluntarily surrender my car and transferred me to an account manager, Tanicia. Tanicia explained to me that voluntary surrender is if a lease cannot make payments and that she was in the collections department. When I explained to her the problem was with my car, and not the financial responsibilities, she gave me the Chrysler Customer Service number again as well as the Warranty Department. I asked for a legal department within Chrysler Financial, but she was unable to give me a number for that department.",
"I purchased a pre-owned 2008 Jeep Wrangler with a soft top 3 weeks ago. A week ago, after a heavy rain, I noticed that there was a leak. I noticed that there was a patched up hole. I contacted the dealership and they admitted that there was a previous hole that was patched. They offered to have the hole re-patched but I have been told by several individuals that do that kind of work, that you would be able to tell that there is a patch. They will not replace the top, or even help replace the top. I have contacted Jeep/Chrysler and they are not willing to do anything for me.",
"We purchased a Jeep Wrangler in February 2008. A short time later, the Jeep shut down while driving; I had it towed home. The problem continued and we took it to the dealer several times. They drove it around a few times and said they did not see anything wrong. The problem continued so I called they said there is nothing they could do to help. As we were looking at the Jeep at home, we noticed the check engine light was not coming on even when first started, took the dash apart and there was no bulb. In the end we took the Jeep to Goodyear three different times and now the problem is still happening - no solutions.",
"In June of 2002, I purchased a new Jeep Wrangler with an extended warranty. In July of 2003, as I was going to work, my Jeep kept stalling, so I pulled over. It started back up, but kept stalling out. At work, I called Genes, explained the problem, and they sent out a tow truck. They installed a new cam, and my jeep was back in just a few days. I was impressed with their service. Up until the third week of August 2008, I have had no problems. I then noticed my oil pressure was dropping and the check gauges alarm would go on. I called Genes to make an appointment. After a week, I called and I was told my Jeep was done. I also had them do a minor tune-up. I paid 273.00 dollars and left Genes to go home. About 20 minutes later, my alarm went off and my oil pressure gauge went to zero. I pulled over off the freeway and shut the engine off. 
      I called the service department and was put on hold. I was then told I would have to tow it back at my own expense because it might be something I did. I told the girl I had just picked it up, and was driving home. She said there was nothing she could do about it. I restarted the motor, and the pressure came back up, so I returned to Genes, just as I lost the pressure again. I put the paperwork and keys on the counter and said fix it. After getting a ride home, the phone rang. It was Genes. An Edward ** told me to bring my Jeep in, as my parts just arrived. I questioned him about my parts and then explained the Jeep was brought back for the second time because I was told it was done. He put me on hold, came back on the phone and told me he was looking at the wrong paperwork. Terry **, the service manager, asked when was the last time I had my oil change changed. I told him less than 1000 miles ago and that the sticker was on my windshield. He then asked why I didn’t have the oil changes at Genes, and after explaining to him I have faster service at Jiffy Lube, he wanted all my oil change receipts. The only two receipts I didn’t have is when my fiancé’s son changed it and when I changed it. I was then told he would not honor the warranty. Genes did a diagnostic (after the tune-up). A customer service rep. called and put me on speakerphone with a mechanic, and I was told the Jeep needed a new cam. I said that Genes put a new cam in 2003, so how is it possible it needs another cam? The mechanic said, ""We did?"" and I replied yes. He said he would look it up and call me back. He never did. My Jeep was at Genes till November 12th. At which time, they had put in a new oil pump for 723.03. Again, I was told they would not honor the warranty. After several calls to Chrysler Corp. and the warranty dept., which happens to be in India, nothing has been done. I also said if the warranty will not be honored, I want the money I paid for the extended warranty back. I have all this documented with times, dates and names of the people I talked to. I also told Genes I have four vehicles, two jeeps, an F-150 Ford and an original 1971 Toyota Landcruiser all in perfect working condition (except for the 2002 Wrangler which is now in the garage with only 78,000 miles).",
"I drove to Los Angeles from our home on Mon., 5 Jan 2009 (about 140 miles round-trip). I was travelling about 60 mph on the way home, when my new (less than 1-year-old) 2008 Jeep Wrangler (4-Door) began shaking violently. This happened twice on the way home so that I had to try to pull off the highway but could hardly control the car. Other cars on the highway (I5) started putting on their EMERGENCY blinkers. My 4-year-old son was in the back, and we were scared for our lives!!!! It happened again when picking my daughter up from school! HELP!",
"I have a 2004 Jeep Wrangler. My clutch recently blew in August, and I had the mechanic Tuan look at the car and he voiced that the clutch needed to be replaced. Thus, he went forward and replaced the clutch. Three months later, less than 2,000 miles, my clutch and car stop working after the end of road trip. I returned the car to the mechanic and voiced I was having problems. My equipment and labor was covered under warranty for 6000 miles or 6 months, so I expected no problems. 
      Now the mechanic has said the bearing retainer is broken and wasn't covered under my warranty because I drove it over 6000 miles. Incorrect, my inspection in July stated that my mileage was 56245. The mechanic noted that an oil change in September was 52000. That was a falsehood. To continue on, now he says my bearing retainer is broken and that he does not replace this with a standard clutch kit. After this, I called a Jeep dealership and 2 other mechanics, each of them voiced the same concern that this person was being untruthful and unlawful. This part should be on warranty and have been replaced when the car was initially in there for clutch repair. All bearings are to be replaced when a new clutch is reinstalled. I have no choice to believe the other 3; when the said mechanic, Tuan, began the entire scenario with a lie to begin with. Because I initially voiced it was the clutch and he lied off the bat saying it was over warranty mileage. He refuses to cover the cost of the part and says he will cut labor in half. I will be buying the part myself and have him doing it because it'll cost more to put it together and relocate it. I am a single professional female with no means of transportation to work, having the car indisposed for more than 3 weeks is not much of an option or I will lose my job. I'm upset that I was lied to initially, and that the other 3 mechanics have backed my stories but this man has left me with no other choice and taking advantage of the situation. They are refusing to back up any warranty and will only cut labor in half. Transportation to and from work has me leaving work early and arriving late. Not to mention I am losing more money on replacing and paying for more labor and parts. Not to mention the physical and mental stress dealing with the situation has caused.",
"In 2005 I purchased a New 2005 Jeep Wrangler X. At 3,100 miles the engine was replaced under warranty. Every other month there after the dealer had to replace the disc brake rotors. At 21,000 the engine would not idle smooth and the front end would make a cracking sound on turns. I couldn't take this any longer and traded in on a New 2006 Jeep Liberty. 
      All was great until 22,000 miles, a heavy clunk sound began each time I went over a small bump coming from the left rear. The vehicle has been checked by the dealer three times. They can't locate the problem. I became so frustrated I had both rear shocks replaced at my expense. At just over 22,000 miles the malfunction lamp came on. The dealer had to replace the BCM( Body Control Module). All was great until 8-19-08 when the ABS, ESP and Traction Lamp came on when I accelerated onto the highway. This vehicle is becoming another nightmare. Two new Jeep vehicles in two having problems. I would like to trade this vehicle, but now I have negative equity and the Liberty residual value is so low. This vehicle has become a true lemon and I'm stuck with it. Others that I have spoke to said I have no recourse.  I became so worried about constant or possible breakdowns, that I recently purchased Chrysler extended warranty two weeks ago. Please Help!Both vehicles were new when purchased.",
"i own a 2003 Jeep Wrangler TJ. 77,000 miles. ^ cyl automatic. Like many other jeep owners, i am experiencing Stalling problems. Usually it stalls at lights, or when the car is in gear, but foot is off the gas pedal. Occasionally, it stalls while i am driving at higher speeds (35-50 mph), The car shuts down, the steering becomes really difficult. i have now seen MANY people complaining of the same difficulties, while seeking an answer to this problem on the web. I purchased this car Used, from a private party, but the dealership here in Maui (96793), claims no knowledge of such problems being ;usual' in the jeep.",
"Since the first day that I bought my Jeep Wrangler 4 door I had nothing but problems. I had a broken front door hinge that took the body shop (they sent it to) three days to fix. When it returned to the dealership they realized the paint didn't match the new hinge to the door, so they sent it to another bodyshop. They had my Jeep for 2 more days because they couldn't get the paint to stick to the door. When I received my Jeep I noticed the bodyshop painted under the hinge with a touch up brush.
      I spent 30,000+ for a brushed up Jeep, and drove around in a dodge neon for a week. My Jeep isn't a stock Jeep the dealership put a 3 inch lift and 35 inch tires with 18 inch custom rims on it before I purchased it. I have a really nice looking Jeep with a crappy touch up job. I told them as long as they were going to warranty the parts and if any rust happened to show up over the life of my Jeep then they would be responsible and they agreed. Next problem that I had was and still is rain leaks into the Jeep around all of my doors especially my front passenger door and drivers rear door. My back floor board has had standing water in it, and the front passenger leak soaks my passenger seat. It is very embarrassing and could create a health hazard when mold and mildew start to grow under my floor mats, or in my seat. My Jeep has been in the shop at Century several times and every time I have my oil changed I ask where they are on finding a fix for my problems. I also have a rattle on my drivers side in the door that had the hinge fixed they can never recreate the problem, but I took the Jeep in and showed Kevin the sales manager the water spots and the wet seat from the rain we had that day. He told me his service manager would be calling me that was 4 months ago and Kevin is dodging my calls. When he is confronted with these problem by me he acts really busy and tells me he will get right back to me, but never does. I want my Jeep fixed or the money owed on the Jeep and they can have it back.",
"The blower fan speeds in my 1999 Jeep Wrangler have stopped working in different combinations (no low, no high, no medium).  I have had the three switch climate control box replaced completely at the dealership under warranty.  I have replaced the entire control box once myself after the warranty expired, and noticed melted plastic on the connectors and wires leading to different areas of the climate controls.  
      This has happened for a third time this year, and upon disassembly, I've found that the connector and speed control switch have melted together in to once piece, requiring extensive work to separate.  Now, the wiring harness leading to the blower fan speed control is useless, requiring replacement (or splicing).  I have replaced the blower motor resistor.  After consulting with both an automotive mechanic with an wiring/electrical specialty, and after consulting directly with a company that manufactures complete climate control systems for other major car manufacturers, I replaced the entire blower motor.   This seems to be a widespread problem, as seen by internet searching for jeep blower resistor.",

"I bought a 2007 Jeep Wrangler hard top in June 2007. July 2007 the A/C didn't work, I was told it was due to a rock hitting the A/C the dealer was not going to repair it under the warranty until I got upset with them and explained it was a offroad vehicle and I did not want it if that was the case. They fixed the problem however I have had 2 recall fixed and the dash light were staying on that was fixed also. I now have a leak problem.  When it rains the inside of the jeep is soaked. I am so tired of this vehicle it was the worst purchase of my life.",

"I purchased a new 2007 Jeep Wrangler, last summer 2007. This is the first winter with this vehicle, I love my Jeep. Except for the factory 16 steel wheels. I am noticing a severe vehicle shake at 55mph. Well. The cause is ice and snow frozen behind the spokes of the wheel, the reason is whom ever designed this rim incorporated a trench or cavity behind the spokes. Since this trench is behind the spokes it is nearly impossible to chip the ice away. This is the only factory wheel Jeep makes with this trench. What happens the weight of this ice throws the wheel extremely out of balance it's so extreme the steering wheel shakes and turns back and forth on it's own making it impossible to drive over 50mph.",
"I just bought a 2008 Jeep Wrangler,put an estimate amount of 40 miles on the Jeep and the transmission went. The dealership that I bought the Jeep from has been WONDERFUL in helping me with the problem. Took the Jeep back to them on Monday January 21. They put it on the computer and got a transmission error. They called Chrysler Monday afternoon and never got a return call back about the code on the computer. Tuesday afternoon I called the costumer line at Chrysler to see why no return call. The girl I spoke to called the dealership I bought the Jeep from and spoke to the service manager and within a 1/2 hour they got a call on the code and they were told it was a transmission valve pan. They got the part yesterday and pulled the transmission to put the new part on and noticed that the whole transmission was bad (on a brand new car)!!!! So in the mean time of this, if it would not have been for the dealership out of the kindness of their hearts giving me a loaner car because Chrysler would not authorize them to give me a car to use. I would not have had a car to get back and forth to work. Yesterday when I found out that the Jeep's transmission was bad and they had to rebilled the transmission and would not have my brand new Jeep for about a week and Chrysler would not authorize me another one to use. I called Chrysler again and the costumer service rep. 
      Bernard was so rude to me he hung up on me.In the mean time the dealerships General Manager also called to get Chrysler to complain about the Jeep and to get authorization for a loaner Jeep, in which the authorized for one week a car. I live in the mountains and it snows almost everyday and a regular front wheel drive car does not go. So the dealership is letting me use a 4-wheel drive SUV. Just because they feel that they should and they are great. I don't know what to do next. If it wasn't for the people at the dealership I would not have a 4-wheel drive to use and I believe Chrysler does not care about their consumers who buy off of them and as soon as you sing the papers. It is screw you and they laugh at you with the money in their pocket. I will never ever buy another Chrysler product again just because of the way I am being treated at the main office.",
"I bought my 2007 Jeep Wrangler 4 door brand new in February 2007. In November '07 i tried starting my vehicle after a late night trip to the grocery store, but it wouldn't. The security light came on for about 3 seconds, then flashed, then killed the entire system. The radio, odometer, engine-nothing would come on. I waited for about an hour for a tow. The dealership kept the vehicle for a week and said the SKIM module had shorted. In other words, the key was thought to be invalid by the vehicle so it had locked itself. Fast forward to yesterday afternoon, only 45 days and 1500 miles later. I took my sons to a neighborhood park and when we tried to leave the vehicle again locked itself. I called the Chrysler Roadside Assistance at 415pm. The tow truck did not show up until 705. Still waiting for word from the dealership as to the problem-I know it's the SKIM module again, but they have to check all avenues. BTW-my contract didn't cover a rental, so I had to argue until the service manager agreed to provide me with one. Did they really expect me to go another week without a vehicle? Absolutely frustrated at this point-who pays over $25000 for a vehicle that leaves them stranded 2 times in 2 months?!? Anyone else having this problem?",

The engine is off but it stays on auxiliary power and of course will run the battery down. I'm wondering if anyone else is having this issue.",
"Brand new 4 door wrangler 6 speed  sahara bought 12/2006 in LA area. at 5000 miles clutch, manifold, missing bolts & lights had to be replaced plus a recall item. en route from LA to NY a recall was issued for stalling while on the freeway (I had complained earlier of this problem). dealer in NY fixed recall item but said couldn't fix other complaint which was loud noise, extreme lack of power, car shaking and almost dying. took it to dealer 2 more times in NY because the car was in bad shape and I still had to drive it back to L.A. 
      Dealer stated, many times, nothing was wrong with the car. They just did not want to fix it becuz a Jiffy Lube employee would have noticed the stick shift jerking 6 to and fro and making horrendous noises. In Morris, IL the car was so bad that I wouldn't drive it again. Found a dealer open for 3 hrs. on a Sat. a.m. and they said the drive train had fallen apart and it would take at least a week to repair it. they said they were surprised it was even moving and that I was very lucky to get there. I am self employed and did not have a week to throw away as I promised I would be on a job in L.A. The dealer agreed with me that the car was a lemon and I decided to just cut my losses and run. didn't have the wherewithal to deal with the lemon law as I have to work (I am a painting contractor and need an suv type vehicle) Well, it is against the law to sell a car in IL on a Sunday, plus I had no car to trade in anywhere else. I did not want another Jeep. I had no choice but to buy another Jeep from the dealer. I got screwed and lost thousands of dollars which I can not afford to do. I felt I had no choice in the matter if I wanted to keep my job back in L.A. The only Jeep available was a lesser package and an automatic. I hate automatics but needed a car. So now I have a Jeep that has a mere 6000 miles on it and it is SEVERELY RUSTED (I have pics) underneath and lags considerably when I try to pass or merge. The rpms go clear to the red line before it will kick in and move forward. I have nearly killed myself due to this. Yesterday at the dealers (for yet another recall) I complained about the rust and lagging. They called Jeep about the rust and were told they could only fix a rust problem if it wore out a part, and only that part, and said it wouldn't hurt the car. Hello. Rust eats metal. The lagging problem, well, I got the usual --- it's a Jeep thing and there is nothing wrong with it. The rust warranty is for 100,000 miles and they are refusing to do anything. I rarely complain about my cars and when I do I am always right (clutch and drive train case in point) so I know the newest Jeep is going to fall apart if it isn't consumed by rust first. And how can I ever resell a car covered in rust underneath? There is something wrong with the tranny and lagging. I am out so many thousands of dollars and time, motels, dealer trips, loading and unloading work vehicles, it is not funny. Looking at blogs there are thousands of people having trouble with the 2007 4 door wranglers --- not just me. WHAT CAN I DO to recoup my monies and get rid of this rusted, lagging piece of junk? BTW - car was made June 2007 I took it in Aug/Sept and went to L.A. The vehicle has not had a drop of rain on it for it to rust and it has not been driven off road or trekking thru streams, ie; a Jeep thing as they like to call it.",
"I am having trouble with the internet described problem of the DEATH WOBBLE.  At 55 mph, my 2004 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon will begin bouncing back and forth across the lane uncontrollably.  The only way to stop it is to slow down to a stop and then continue on my path.  At first, the problem only happened when hitting a small bump in the road.  After just a few days, the wobble happened anytime the Jeep was driven above 50 miles per hour.  The wobble is so bad, it feels as if the front wheels are going to fall off the Jeep.",

"I had problems with my 4-dr wrangler from the beginning.  I had the stalling at 70 mph and also sitting at a light.  I have a ignition cranking problem and a problem where if I hit bumps in the road going at low and high speeds the Jeep will begin bouncing up and down so uncontrollable that it will bounce me off of the road.  The only way to get it stopped is to come to a complete stop to try to re-set the vehicle.  No one wants to acknowledge that there is a problem.  They reprogrammed the TIPM thru a recall but unfortunately it only stopped the stalling.  Now I get to try this again.  The frustrating thing is that the Jeep corp offices do not care.  I have told them that it is a very serious safely concern for me and my kids but they don't care.  They say that I have to go back to the dealers - but they don't make the problems searchable in their database so then the dealer when they go to search can't find any other instances, can't recreate the problem so- they think that you are the only person having the problem and don't know how to fix it.  It's ridiculous that they can get away with this.  I realized when I bought the vehicle that I was running the risk that there would be problems since its a first year model but my expectation was that they would FIX the problems and that I wouldn't have to fear for my life and that of my kids.  Something has GOT to be done. .",

My 2004 Jeep wrangler is exhibiting the same symptoms as 2007 Jeep wranglers that are being recalled by Jeep.   It stalls at highway speeds.  This is especially dangerous when I am on the interstate and have traffic behind me.  The Jeep dealers that I have taken it to think it might be the power control module.

"I have experienced the stalling of my 7 month old 2007 Jeep Wrangler. First time happened at 3,000 miles, going up a hill and the vehicle completely lost ALL power for 2 to 3 seconds, took to dealer they did a flash of the computer. All was well until 9,000 miles did it again.  I am very concerned that the next time it happens I may be traveling a road with heavy traffic or curves and potentially have a tragic accident, involving not only myself but someone else.  I took it back to the dealer they kept it for 2 days and could not find a problem. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND A SOLUTION FOUND, ONE LIFE FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE PREVENTED IS TOO MUCH!!

"I have a Jeep Wrangler. The day I bought it it was shifting improperly. The selling dealer took care of it immediately.  A month later the same problem surfaced. The dealer took two days to try and fix it, they didn't. I took it to another Jeep dealer who fixed it again.  Leap forward a year. I've moved to CA and the dealer here says it is a bent rod that was installed improperly but it wasn't covered by warranty.  
      I called HQ Chrysler and they said it should be covered.  Back to dealer...nope. Not covered.  So, re-called Jeep, oh...yeah, not covered. I've had this problem three times and each time it resurfaced, jeep is now saying my $300.00 problem. (It won't go into park or drive) Even though Jeep said the Shifting knob is covered, and all the transmission is covered, the linkage between the two is not. Hmmm.   Also, my radio went bad three different times....not covered. My warentee clearly says it is.  They said it was not an accessory so not covered. Since it was original factory, it isn't covered.  I did some digging and showed them and NOW it is covered.  Hmmmm.  So, I call and it is covered, dealer says no. I recall and HQ says oh yeah it isn't covered. I read them the warranty....oh...We'll check.  Story changes every time I speak with a different representative. No consistency or common sense. Story is short subject, transmission still shifts poorly and I've spent over three hundred in diagnostic tests. Since problem isn't covered neither are these diagnostic tests. Jeep still isn't running correctly, they've had for over 15 days and I get no rental car. Okay, so, I'll never by from Chrysler again, nor will Weaver get any of my business. Runarounds and double-dealings in Jeep dealers across the country. It is systemic in Chrysler and too consistent to be only dealer to dealer. Shame on Chrysler. This will cost them thousands as I'll not buy from them again.",
"I own a Jeep Grand Cherokee. I keep my vehicles for many years, especially when I like them. Unfortunately, Chrysler is now off my list. Dealership and corporate customer service are basically non-existent. Here's my story. Back just before COVID popped up, I had a recall for a part that was defective. It was the dashboard leather cover. I took my car into the local dealership (I10 in Indio, CA) and they took pictures and said it qualified for the recall. I took my car in for service a couple more times in the next few months and asked about the recall - they stated I shouldn't expect anything soon, since there were delays due to COVID. This went on for two years - every time I asked, they would tell me ""When your part comes in, you'll be notified"". Turns out they never ordered it. And now they are denying any knowledge.
      I spoke to Amrit with Stellantis Case Management who requested I send information on the encounter with the dealership. I had very little, since I thought they were taking care of it. I submitted what I had and then waited. After a month, I contacted them for a status update, but never heard back. Then I got an email to rate their service. After leaving a bad review for their customer care experience, I was contacted by Caitlin of the Jeep Customer Engagement Team. Of course they are denying all responsibility as well. No more Chrysler for me - they don't stand behind their product.",1.0
"I have a 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it is the awful. It has had the stereo replaced 2x, broke down losing power due to a bad cylinder and now the automatic emergency brake comes on when I try and backup with nothing around me. The dealership can't find the issue and has just said to shut the feature off so that it doesn't come back on. That's not a fix!!! I contact Stellantis the Retention dept for Jeep and they offered me a CDI which is a voucher to received a discount that they say is a discount from employee pricing or 5% off invoice. That is a lie. 
      I have been to 2 different dealerships and neither would explain what the CDI discount actually is. They just make up numbers and try and sell you the same vehicle for more money and then include additional feature that I would not want to purchase at a dealership. Since the dealership cant mimic the issue they have offered no fix other than shutting the feature off but isn't this a safety feature? I have tried to call Stellantis back and they can't explain the CDI but just say keep going to different dealerships until you find one that will work with you. I am now stuck with this POS for 2 more years or I will have to suck it up and take a loss and trade it in. DO NOT BUY A JEEP PRODUCT!!!",1.0
"I purchased a 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and love it. The local dealers in the Sandhills region of NC where I live are great. However, I recently got a recall notice regarding a safety issue driving with a defective coil. I took my jeep in for the required inspection and it was confirmed my vehicle was affected. Then I was told by two different jeep dealers that they can only order a Limited amount of these coils and you have to wait for weeks to get one. Meanwhile I gave a cross country trip to take coming up and have been told it's a safety issue to drive the jeep as is with the defective part. So I called Jeep headquarters and explained my situation. They stated they cannot expedite the part for my trip which is a month away and they do not offer rental assistance.

The dealership doesn't have a loaner program. I've been wasting hours of my time on the phone with Jeep trying to get a car rental under their base warranty, but they're telling me I have to pay for the car rental.

"Worst Service Department: I bought my Jeep Grand Cherokee Altitude 4x4 back in 2020 and last year in October 2022 I brought it for service because I started feeling noises and vibrations from the front transmission. They found a play in the inner and outer tie rods and because I bought an extended warranty, the dealer supposed to take care of that. But guess what, no parts were available and today February 2023 I'm still waiting for those. The communication/response from the service department has been poor. I sent many emails ang got response just for 2 saying in a roughly manner that the parts are not available yet. I got the Service Manager name but not his number because when I called, someone told me that his number was not available. I just kept the communication with the service rep Alejandro **.
      There is no way of communication by phone. The service rep never pick the phone up. I had to go personally to ask for status. I think this is not acceptable.

"Having enjoyed my 1st car being a 1997 TJ Wrangler I opted to purchase again when it came time to get a more family friendly vehicle. I purchased a 2012 Overland Summit Grand Cherokee with Saddle interior. It is an ok car, the electrical system has failed twice resulting in a tow both times with about 3 weeks of downtime trying to schedule the repairs both times. While the transmission is still holding in it has made large clunking sounds when engaging into gear about 3 months after purchase and seems like it is designed to fail after 100k miles. 
      The interior has been my biggest letdown. I purchased a high trim model specifically for the interior. The color is rubbing off the tan leather in the high wear locations but the glue holding the dash in place has completely released and the leather dash has now become a loose piece of leather laying there. I spoke with our local dealer who said this was a known issue and said extended warranty X81 would cover this repair. After scheduling a replacement (1 year out) I patiently waited for the repair. When the year came up they said the parts were delayed and that is was still several months out, I again patiently waited. At this point the dealer said that the issue was now a corporate issue where they told me that the term (which I was in during the initial warranty) had expired and they will no longer support this. The cheap plastic base model would have lasted longer than the higher trim and I am super frustrated with how Chrysler handled the repairs. I look forward to supporting new companies such as Tesla for challenging the industry norms that many companies have fallen into with age producing cheap products and only looking at the bottom line. I am glad the dealership model is being challenged and I hope to never deal with a dealership again. I was a once great fan of this brand and am sad to say that is no longer the case.",1.0

What kind of idiot would spend 100K on a Jeep with a ** warranty and ** dealer service. My seat frame breaks on mine and they have fixed it twice. It breaks within 1 day.

"I have owned seven Jeeps over 40 years and loved them all. I bought a new 2019 Jeep Altitude. Two days into having this new car I started getting ""weather alerts"" popping up on my center console screen. After exhaustive research I was told these alerts could not be disabled. I checked the Jeep forums as well. The complaints were overwhelming. These alerts are usually for counties 3 to 6 hours away. They usually are wind and storm warnings. I receive on average 20 of these alerts a week. I have to each time take my eyes off the road and press the box acknowledging that I've seen the alert. 
      I've now had the car 21 months and have received over 1600 weather alerts, all having absolutely NOTHING to do with where I was located. This is without a doubt the most annoying ""feature"" ever pushed onto the car buying public. Read the on-line reviews. People are seriously upset with this and have every right to be. The dealer knew of this when I bought the car and said nothing. This feature is on all Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep products. Again, it cannot be disabled. Lastly, I seriously suspect this was ""invented"" or ""perpetrated"" by an individual that was born in the 90's, avoids all human interaction, lives on their ""smart phone"" while still living with their mother.",3.0
"I've had 6 Jeep Grand Cherokees so when my last one had the head gasket go at just over 200,000 I bought a certified preowned 2017 without thinking twice. My bad. This car is so badly designed that after two weeks I am looking for another car. For one thing, the hum of the engine is so loud that it makes my head hurt, especially at low speeds. The sound quality of the radio is horrible and the hands free is practically unusable and the UConnect flips back to the phone and shuts off intermittently. 
      Moreover, all the important things such as radio, climate control, require multiple steps and the information you need to see is so small it's hard to read. The interior design has absolutely no place to put anything; I've lost my phone 4 times already because I need to put it on the passenger seat. No place for change, lipstick, or small items we routinely carry and the storage on the doors is so narrow and deep you can't put your hand in it. Anything you put there is lost forever.The car has also failed to start every morning for the last week and has required a jump start. The dealer, who has serviced every one of my cars, is flummoxed. The aerodynamics are terrible; I feel like I'm in an echo chamber. First car in 54 years of driving and more than 30 years of Jeeps that I can honestly say I hate. I'm already shopping for another vehicle; I don't care if I take a hit because I spend on average 4 hours a day in a car and I find myself dreading getting into it.",2.0
We are now on our 4th radiator in our 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The dealership states no damage to the radiator other than leaking at the seams. I contacted Jeep and they opened a case. I spoke to the RUDEST Senior Case specialist named Phyllis. All I wanted to know is why we keep having this issue. All she would tell me is that they buy their parts from a third party vendor. She needs another job other than dealing with the public. I will think twice before ever buying a Jeep product.,1.0
"Relatively new, 6000 miles, Jeep Grand Cherokee. 3 different occasions did not start. Towed to dealer, they kept 9 days. Could not solve it. Told me to come get the car, they could not fix. They said could be this, could be that. I said well start with theory one and replace the part. Dealer informed me Jeep will not let them do this, they must know for sure.
      I said so late one night I could be stranded again. Wait 1 1/2 hours forJeep to show up to tow again. Back to square one then. They said yes. Jeep will not stand behind their product so who knows how many times I will be stranded before they find exact cause. I am a retired gentleman in middle of Covid 19 pandemic and Jeep will not stand behind their product. PLEASE, PLEASE do not make same mistake I did. Buy another, dependable brand.",1.0
"On February 12, 2020, I was in a major accident that should have cost me a lot more than a vehicle. I was hit in the driver's door by a dump truck at 60mph. Thankfully I was in my Jeep! The frame took the force of the blow and it slid 50 yards before it came to a stop beside an electrical pole. While my Jeep was totalled, I was lucky enough to walk away with only a few scratches and bruises. I think I have sold all my friends and family on how safe Jeeps are. My son has asked for one for his 16th birthday and I think it's a wonderful idea. Just wanted to say Thank you, had I been in our van I wouldn't have made it.",5.0
"I love the way the Jeep Grand Cherokee Looks and drives. I have had several issues, that some might overlook in the car buying mindset, however will come to bite them in the end. They include, Eco Engine Failure (had to replace engine - $5,000), computer issues (multiple) some would leave me stranded because I could not start Jeep. Cannot replace headlights without removing front bumper, dealership will replace for $300. Battery placement is under front passenger seat. Finally, dash looks great but cannot handle Texas heat, Jeep will not replace dash as it is not covered are a recall item. If you like flashy then Jeep is your car. If you like dependability, you might want to reconsider. If you like keeping your money, find a different vehicle.",2.0
The 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a fantastic car. It has great power and is very comfortable especially for those of us that are taller. The only thing I have an issue with is the engine turning off when you come to a stop sign then turning on again when you go. I keep the button pushed to turn that option off all the time. I can haul my gardening stuff as well as my grandkids. Beautiful red color too.,5.0

"Bought a brand new 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee. From day 1, the vehicles jerks and searches for a gear when reducing the speed through town. Under 40 mph. Brought to dealer and he indicated everything checked out as normal diagnostics and all software upgrades up to date. Also indicated that the car is operating as designed or programmed. Very poor design by Chrysler. Other buyers have also complained to the dealer regarding the transmission programming. Called customer service and they were no help. Just told me to keep checking with the dealer for possible software updates. Glad I leased it, but wish I didn’t even do that based on my experience. I’ll never buy another Chrysler or Jeep product again. I will probably buy a Honda next time.",1.0
"My husband and I thought that the 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Unlimited would be the perfect SUV. I was wrong. We purchased our Jeep certified pre-owned in June 2018 with 29,000 miles. In August 2018 my transmission went out, as I was driving up the a hill in the middle of the night. In April 2019 my transmission went out again for the second time as I was driving in the freeway. Now my driver side seat belt is not working.",1.0
"Wow, I thought that the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee unlimited would be a great family car. I was wrong. We bought our Jeep certified pre-owned with 30,000 miles. We have had the Jeep for 3 years and 20,000 miles. The touchscreen went out and can not be replaced 3rd party like car toys, has to be done at Jeep dealership. Cost $1,400. When we asked why this happened they had no clue, I asked, ""What’s gonna stop it from happening again?"" They said, ""Nothing. It just might."" The passenger window cracked for no reason down the length (no impact mark). Also not covered and had no knowledge why it happened. In the back seats there is controls for air, heated seats and a 110 outlet. All of those stopped working ($600). When asked why they stopped working again the answer was, ""We don’t know.""
      Now the Jeep makes weird noises from engine bay oh also the 4wd SUCKS!!!! Couldn’t handle the slightest mud! It even had some gravel in there, still got stuck. And I had decent tires on it too! I just can’t get past the fact when I took it in for the problems the sales tech asked if we bought the extended warranty for the Jeep, I said, ""No I figured a $34,000 suv would have decent reliability."" He looked up and smiled “Oh you should’ve”.... Wow Jeep just wow. Will never ever buy a vehicle from them as long as I live! You figure a company would stand behind their vehicle right? Well NOT JEEP! Save yourself the hassle. Get a Toyota!",1.0
"Bought Japanese since 1989. Thought I would give USA another chance in 2018. Bad Bad Bad mistake. Issues: Head lights -Like driving with a blindfold. If you go more than 30 mph on an unlit side street, you WILL hit something. Purchased Philips X-Treme Vision headlamps for $130.00 just made everything brighter but you still can't see the side of the road. The headlights criss-cross and almost meet about 25 ft ahead. Took it to the dealer at least 4 times...not any better. Decided to buy out lease and sell this piece of junk. 
      Nav system-Catch this: To turn on the Nav you must first turn on the radio and then mute it. What is that all about. Then there is a separate button to blank screen. No planning at all went into this design. The dash is extremely distracting. Even the radio is tough. The bright light button is opposite every other car on the road. It rides bumpy and if you take your eyes off the road for more than a second you will end up in another lane or on someone's porch. Funny they didn't put the blinker on the opposite side. LOL. My 2005 MDX that I dearly miss after 13 yrs of heaven, It was like driving in the daylight. The road lit up the sidewalks lit up you could go 90 and never outrun the headlights. Will take a loss when I sell it but at least I may be alive!",1.0
My 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee just accelerated by itself up a sidewalk at a parking lot and ran into the pillar of a building. I then put it in reverse and it accelerated into a car parked beside me. The front axle snapped completely even though the impact was not tremendous. This vehicle has all kinds of impact sensors and usually brakes on its own even when it senses a leaf from a nearby bush and none of that worked. This happened just yesterday and I'm at a loss as to what to do. I cannot believe my internet search has yielded so many similar stories!,1.0
"So as it goes and other have similar comments, I spent 60K on my 2014 Grand Cherokee and the 1st 70K was an awesome experience then all of a sudden we need to change the brakes. Rotors now warp every 5K - 7K mile and the dealership which has a 2 year warranty will not honor it after the 4th set replaced in less than a year and my leather wrapped dash is bubbling all over the place and the Jeep wants 3K to replace the hole dash. After having a heated discussion over the brake the service manager actually had the never to insult my wife and tell me it is driver error. Same driver since new, same highway driving patterns as well. This is completely disrespectful and unprofessional.",2.0

"I purchased a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee in Feb 2017. On Oct. 5, 2018. I was driving to my boss's house for a retirement party. My 19 yr old daughter and my 69yr old mother were in the car. They were going to go shopping while I was at the party, then come pick me up after. I arrived at the house, put the car in park and even set the parking brake for safety. I got out of the vehicle and proceeded into the house. My daughter got in the drivers seat, pressed on the break and then released the parking brake. With her foot still on the break, she then tried to shift the car into drive. The car wouldn't shift. Then she saw the message on the dash, ""Key fob has left the vehicle"". She still had her foot on the break, released the break, unhooked her seatbelt and started to exit the vehicle to come get the key fob from me. She got out of the vehicle, was about to close the door and it started to roll. My mother yelled at her to get back in, but she could not. 
      The car knocked my daughter down and she rolled down the embankment. The jeep continued to roll down the hill, through a yard and slammed into a house!! All the while with my mother in the passenger seat!! When I got down to the jeep it was still running and in the ""park"" position. We have tried to contact Jeep to have them come and investigate the vehicle, however, they have given every reason in the book as to why no one could make it to Washington State. Thankfully there were no injuries to any humans, but the property damage and the money we are out to get another vehicle is insane! I would have expected Jeep to be all over this since there was a similar incident that killed that actor in LA. But we have heard nothing! We love the Jeep brand and have never had any trouble with Jeep as a company. They have always taken care of us when something has gone wrong or needed fixed. But this! This is a disappointment. They could have a potential RECALL on their hands and they are choosing to ignore it!!",1.0
"Takata recall upon driving MT Jeep GC on the highway this morning, everything was going fine. I exited the highway at stop light and as usual, the stop/start engaged. When the light turned green I lifted my foot off the brake so the car will start again but it didn’t. So I turned off the radio and auto light and forced the car to natural and pressed the start button and car started. On gauge display a red battery light came on and a message that said ""park car, vehicle will shut down soon"", so I drove around 15 mins to find a safe parking spot and stopped in supermarket parking lot. 2 min later the car shut down.
      I carry with me portable jumper so I opened the hood and connected it but no power was reaching. So I lifted the passenger seat and gained access to the main battery and connected the jumper directly to the terminals but still, no power was circulating. So I connected it to the auxiliary battery and power was there. And the car started. But not safe to drive. I picked up my Jeep four days ago new from the dealer, so when this happened my car had 250 miles on it.",3.0
"I bought a brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited from September of 2016. 6 months later I started having problems with the remote start not working. Took it in and they said it was a bad battery. Worked fine for 4 months, then the remote start quit working and the starter button inside of the vehicle. Then I started getting Service 4WD, Stop/Start not available and a bunch of other stuff. Took it in. Said it was a powertrain module. Needless to say - 5 service visits later and problems escalating, my car is still not fixed. They have had it for over 2 months and it is one thing after another. They don't have the parts and generally can't get it done. But they don't understand why I'm upset because they have given me a loaner vehicle which is a stock Dodge Ram 1500 pickup with no remote start, no backup alert, no seat warmers and I can barely get into it it is so high off the ground. 
      On top of that, some idiot Armor-Alled the floorboards in the front seat and there are no mats so when you try and get in, your feet slide all over the place. They told me Monday that now they have to replace the alternator (again after having it for 2 1/2 months) and they didn't know if they could find the part in town. Haven't heard from them since. Unless you call them, they don't communicate. Craig, the Service (ha, ha) Manager, told me he'd get back to me within 24 hours when I called to complain about the service two weeks ago. I'm still waiting for that phone call. Unfortunately, because more than a year has passed since I bought it, even though it has been in the shop continually, this LEMON does not qualify for the LEMON law. But I do have other recourses and I am looking into them. This is ridiculous.",1.0
"This Jeep is my third jeep and I am extremely disappointed. I have owned a Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and now this Trailhawk. I feel like each Jeep I own, there are more and more issues that plague these vehicles. Most recently I have a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk, since acquiring this, it has required a new transmission (under 20,000). This vehicle also required some other work (which slips my mind at the moment) that was done six months outside of the 3-year warranty. The cost was roughly $2700, thankfully Mopar refunded the majority of costs. I thought this should take care of everything but it is turning into a nightmare of a money pit.
      I have also had to replace brake pads, rotors in the last few months, the passenger rear handle came off. I still need to order a new handle and have it installed but haven’t had the opportunity, so I have been avoiding using this door. On occasion my tailgate won’t close, I usually have to unplug the battery in order to reset this issue or Google a quick fix. 2 weeks ago, I needed to replace the battery because my car wouldn’t start while visiting family, one of the connectors needed to be replaced at this time as well. The final straw has been finding out today that the ball joints need to be replaced. I understand that repairs sometimes need to happen and there is always routine maintenance, but this is excessive.I spend a significant amount of time without my vehicle and spending a lot of money for a car that is about 4 years old. I feel with the issues I feel extremely disappointed at the number of repairs and issues that are occurring and am looking to get a new vehicle when I was hoping this would last a couple more years. I feel that it is quite ridiculous to have to invest so much time and money in renting cars, seeking diagnosis for a relatively newer vehicle, and have never needed to bring in a car so much. This vehicle has become a laughing matter among my friends, family and coworkers. I am embarrassed that I am having so many issues and I wish there was a better warranty, or another option besides getting a different vehicle.",1.0
"I love my Jeep Grand Cherokee. I have had it for 25 years now. The motor is just as strong as when I got it. I chose the Cherokee because it was a 4x4. It has all power inside. It was also bigger than other makes and models. It fits my family and 2 big dogs well. And even with my family in the car there is still room for my shopping. It has all power inside. The seats fold down completely or you can put down one side or the other. However, I have always had issues with are the headlight covers. They have a coating on them that starts to turn the plastic yellow. Also, I would make it so the factory alarm could be shut down or taken out if you did not want to use it. If it goes bad your car will not run.",5.0
"I really love and enjoy my Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. I live in WNY and it does great in 4000 feet of snow. I exaggerated about the snow but not about my Jeep. I like that it's smart which is a change from my last Jeep. I chose this Jeep because I'd owned two, prior to this one, and loved them. I like the appearance of my Jeep, the traction and the fact that I feel that my precious cargo, my kids are safe and secure. I just wish it had an extra seat. But great all around vehicle.",5.0
"The leather interior and heated seats of the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Edition were my top two favorite features especially in the NY wintertime when the average temperature runs so cold that drivers are lucky to be able to get their doors open or their windows rolled down because cars in this type of cold freeze shut. Leather seats keep chill in them pretty well so the fact that this car came equipped with seat heaters that warmed up within just a minute or two was just dreamy. Also, I loved the sunroof/moonroof on this Jeep, great perk. 
      This was the first time that I ever drove a big truck/SUV on a regular basis after driving smaller cars throughout my life. And since I'm used to driving regular cars, getting the hang of handling it smooth was an issue. Also, the money I had to spend for gasoline was ridiculous. The gas tank was huge already, so required a lot of gas to fill up. I generally put in $10 to $15 maximum and gas up more often than full tank fillers. And I found myself having to put in that amount of gas on a daily basis and that was a while fresh new financial hell for me to navigate.",4.0
"My overall experience with the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee has been positive. Now that we are retired, we travel often. Sometimes with kids and grandkids. We occasionally fly but almost always we drive, and this is the perfect vehicle. I like its appearance and solidity. It is reliable, roomy, comfortable and safe. And these are all important to me. We also need 4 wheel drive because we live in the mountains. However, I do wish it got better mileage. And since we travel with the grandkids often, I wish there were more little 'nooks' where they could store their stuff and more drink holders. Other than that, I'm a satisfied customer.",4.0
"It's a very good looking car. Great color that is hard to fade or ding. Good looking interior with comfortable seats and room for our animals. I like the easy to read dash and good stereo. Love the CD player and able to adjust to fit just right. But I wish there's a car lighter, more cup holders and better speakers in back. Also, Make it easier to add the essential fluids to engine (oil, water, brake fluid, transmission fluid, windshield fluid) and better way not to have gasket (where you fill the gas tank) fail as it is an impossible repair & hard to find in 1st place when engine light is on. Overall, this vehicle has great all around value and lots of longevity with little repairs. Reliable and great riding in all conditions and in almost all terrains.",5.0

"When I was looking at the Jeep, I felt that this Grand Cherokee was the best deal. I was looking for a two door Jeep and there are many accessories available too! Love it! It's fun and versatile! I can drive with the sunroof off or the whole top! I can take the doors off of the Jeep so we can ride around in the nice weather, I guess I could remove the windshield too! But I would like to see a better sound system, being a Jeep. It's loud while driving, I can hear the wind rushing. I also don't love the ride, it seems squirrely to me.

"I purchased a Jeep Grand Cherokee because it is a 4 X 4. It also has a lot of trunk room so it has a lot of room to haul things. I can go camping and 4 wheel driving. I also like that the jeep is higher up than other vehicles. It makes it easier when you are driving over bumps. The cost of the jeep was also a good price. However, I dislike that the maintenance on this vehicle is expensive. I wish it didn’t cost so much to replace the tires. I also wish it got better gas mileage.",4.0
"I have owned my Jeep Liberty for 11 years and I love it. I purchased it because I previously owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo that I also loved. I wanted a newer vehicle so I didn't have to make so many repairs but I couldn't afford a new Grand Cherokee. I knew I wanted to get another Jeep, and the Liberty was affordable for me at the time. However, I wish it was a little roomier and not so compact. If there are other people riding along it seems like there isn't enough room for drinks or purses, etc. Also, the seats are not as comfortable as my Grand Cherokee was and the interior fabric on seats is very cheap. Nevertheless, the 4 wheel drive is a must for where I live. It is a sport model with AC and a CD player.",4.0

"I purchased a brand new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee High Altitude in November 2017 and have had nothing but PROBLEMS since the third day I owned it. The vehicle has a starting problem. I push the button and it does not. Sometimes it takes up to 15 mins for it to finally start after repeatedly pressing the button. I have received absolutely no satisfaction with the dealership. They don’t know how to fix the problem. One person there told me it was a known issue, others are saying they’ve never seen this problem. This non-start issue has continued to this day, 5 months later. I find it very irresponsible that they are selling vehicles their technicians do not know how to fix. This is a safety issue. If I had an emergency and needed to get in my vehicle and go, there is a good chance it would not start and that is RIDICULOUS!
      Over the last month more problems have started. The vehicle does not always reverse when shifted into reverse, then not moving at all when shifted back to drive. It takes several turn off and turn back on attempts to get it to move again. The R on the shifter panel flashes. This has almost created large accidents when I have been in traffic situations but couldn’t move because my vehicle is trash. The air conditioner also does not turn on from time to time and the radio volume does not adjust. I have opened several cases with Jeep customer service and was told an Account Manager would get back to me. I never was contacted. I have been calling back to follow up for months. I have tried every way I know how to find a phone number to Jeep’s corporate office, or the office of FCA rather with no luck.",1.0
"I bought my Jeep Grand Cherokee 2018 Trailhawk from the Orange Park Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram Dealership aka DARSCARS OF JACKSONVILLE at 7233 Blanding Blvd (904) 777-5500 on October 21, 2017 under a three year lease agreement with ALLY AUTO FINANCE account ** (1-888) 925-2559. I noticed sometimes a slight hesitation when shifting the gearbox for which I did not give greater concern. I was satisfied with the car and its performance.
      On March 30, 2018 with approximately 3700 miles I was at the Gateway Pistol and Rifle Range at 9301 Zambito Ave N in Jacksonville with my friend Charlie ** for pistol shooting. My car was parked outside of one of the steel sheds pointing into the shooting bay. When the rain started we decided to drive my car around and under the shed to load my car outside the rain. I took the car around but couldn't quite make it into the shed and had to back up. When shifting into reverse I heard a strange click and my friend told me later that my rear wheels started spinning, which they are not supposed to do. When my car was in the right position my foot was still on the brake I shifted to ""drive"". At this moment the engine roared up and raced forward. I could not stop the car. I steered it into the next empty shooting bay in 1/2 circle into the backstop ending up at the wall which was damaged in the process. All front and side airbags were deployed. The car is presently in the hands of AAA who informed me on April 4, 2018 that my car is a total loss. I believe this is an obvious case of product liability under the lemon law statutes for Florida for which the manufacturer should be held responsible!",1.0
"We purchased a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland in September 2017 with only 70,000 km on it. If we wanted extra warranty it was going to cost us an additional $4300 on top of the original purchase price of $32,000. The Dodge Dealership in Edmonton Alberta said the Jeep was all looked over and passed inspection. By November there was a electrical pull and killed the battery. That was $700. The computer information system acts up (locks us out so you cannot adjust anything, has the rear view camera come on when going down the highway forward etc.) and is way too expensive to fix. Now the air suspension rear has exploded, both bags!!! Another $2500 to add to the mix. The dealership now claims the transmission fluid need changing, the brake pads need to be done etc. We have been GM drivers for over 25 years and decided to try Dodge. We are never going to drive a Dodge again once we can repair and sell this poorly built vehicle.",1.0
"I took possession of the BRAND new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4x4 Overland on 23 October 2017. Being the original owner of a 1980 CJ5, I was attracted to the beautiful leather appointments of the OVERLAND, and its awesome Air ride system. The first problem I had was when she needed gasoline for the very first time, I couldn't get the fuel door open. I was at the gas pump struggling, when I remembered I had piece of metal coat hanger. I used this to unlatch the fuel door, and fill her up. Undaunted as a CJ OWNER, I decided to not close the door fully again, and have them repair it when It was time for her first oil change. 
      On January 8th just after a beautiful snowfall, I was dressed and leaving for work, I headed out of the driveway, all of a sudden... I heard a blood curdling ~ CLANK, CLANKETY CLANK, BANG BANG sound, and all the lights turned AMBER on the DISPLAY... The service 4 wheel light came on, just after a message flashed, ""FOUR WHEEL DRIVE UNAVAILABLE"" then the Traction control warning light glowed red. It was then that I discovered I was stuck in the driveway... ""JEEP DOWN"", ""MAN DOWN"". I phoned the 1800 number and they dispatched a wrecker. The wrecker driver called and asked me if I had 40 feet of room, because other callers had gotten themselves into a pickle (due to the snow). The wrecker driver and I had a colorful word exchange, before he handed me off to another company. 90 minutes later I was riding in a flatbed on our Merry way to the Dealership in which I had purchased her. I picked up a loaner and was on my way - Week #one. I was notified that it was the ""main drive module"" that had failed. Week# two. I was notified that it was the ""transfer case module"" that had failed. Week # 2.5 I was notified that it was the MAIN SHAFT that had failed... And in week # 3, 24 January '18. She was ready to picked up.When I got her home, I discovered there was GREASE on my weather tech floor mats, Grease on the carpet, grease on the door panel and the center armrest... I notified service via text, and since there was no response, I made some pictures, and began cleaning. The dealership did give me two loaners, one of which was an enterprise Grand Cherokee... BRAVO!! They did stay in contact with me... I have NOT since DRIVEN HER... But plan to and I will keep the Blog updated. Oh they fixed the GAS DOOR( I think).",3.0
"My 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland with 36,000 miles has a completely failed transmission. Worse, I am being told a replacement is on backorder and it will be 2-3 weeks for the replacement transmission. FCA and Jeep are making poor quality vehicles and do not have replacement parts available in a reasonable time frame.
      This is the third time the vehicle has been in for service regarding the transmission. It has also been seen three times with two replacements for gas tank vapor issues. There are two dealerships within 15 miles of my house, and anytime I need service it is a week or 10 days to get an appointment. I guess they are overwhelmed by the poor vehicles and all the maintenance required. I would not recommend Jeep to anyone. Do yourself a favor and stay away.",1.0
"In July 2017, the check engine light on my 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee kept coming on, so I decided to have it checked out at a local dealership. After having all the spark plugs and coils changed, it came down to the conclusion that my left cylinder head would need to replaced. Fortunately, Chrysler had extended the factory warranty on this common issue (rather than doing a recall on the engine itself, because they are cheap) and I was to drop off my JEEP at the Chrysler dealer in Annapolis, MD. Since I work 30 miles away in Washington, DC and it's imperative I have a vehicle to get to work, I decided to drop off my JEEP at the Annapolis dealership, where they advised that it would be worked on when the mechanics had free time.
      Upon dropping my JEEP off, the desk clerk didn't tell me I could get a rental car directly through Chrysler for the warranty work, instead I went and got a rental car down the street thinking it would only take a few days to fix the issue. EIGHT DAYS later, I finally get a call (after checking in on it daily) from the dealership saying that my vehicle was finally fixed. I proceeded to give them a receipt for the rental car that I was using, when they advised I would have to go through Corporate to get a refund for my rental car. It was THEN that they advised me I could have gotten a rental car through the dealership when I had initially dropped my JEEP off. Keep in mind, since I'm traveling to and from D.C. everyday I purchased the full coverage on the vehicle, so the total ended up being nearly $1,000.I make contact with Chrysler Customer Service, where I advise them of my vehicle's VIN and they promptly identify the dealership where I had my warranty work done. They send me a link where I can upload my rental car receipt and my proof of payment for the rental car, which I promptly email back to their Customer Service. I called either the same or next day to make sure they received my documents and all the necessary paperwork - which they said they did. I waited a week, and called back to check on the status of my claim. They advised that it typically takes 30 - 60 days to have a claim processed. I then waited about a month to call again, where they again said my claim has yet to be processed. At the point of 60 days, I call to check the status of my claim and they continued to play it off, saying I should hear something back within the next week. Two weeks later, I've heard nothing back yet.Finally, over 3 MONTHS after my claim was filed, I get a call from Chrysler Customer Service representative saying that they have my documents that I gave them, however I didn't have the necessary paperwork documenting that I had the warranty work done at a Chrysler dealership, and that they were closing my case. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Common sense would lead one to believe that one could see that the work was done at the specific Chrysler dealership by researching the VIN - like the person who took my call to make a claim initially did. If the call taker could check to see that I had warranty work done at a Chrysler dealership, why can't a case analyst have this ability?? Further, the call taker likely wouldn't have even taken my claim if they didn't see that I had the work done at a Chrysler facility.In my 8 plus years of being a car owner, I've never experience so much difficulty from such a simple situation. This case comes down to Chrysler not wanting to take responsibility for their own manufacturer error and mistakes. Common sense doesn't apply to this corporation, and they clearly try to cheat their customers from not receiving their due refunds from an issue that was caused by Chrysler. Based upon the many extremely poor Chrysler customer reviews that I've read over the past few months and my own experiences, I personally don't see how this corporation has any loyal customers. I made it a point to say to the last Chrysler representative that I talked to, that I WOULD NEVER BE BUYING A JEEP OR CHRYSLER PRODUCT AGAIN. I would suggest most people do the same, unless they'd like to deal with a corporation who will do anything to save a $ and have little regard for their customers.",1.0
Had a 97 that I still miss. I hate that Jeep understands their mistakes and recalls but push it with manufacturing the recall parts in the hopes people will sell their Jeeps to the next ignorant owner. I just got my airbag recall dealt with after years of the part not being available on my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee and did sell my 1997 with total disclosure to the airbag recall and stalling out while doing 60 on the highway!,4.0

"My husband and I purchased '14 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Autoland 170 Route 22 Springfield, NJ on April 11,2016. This is a certified pre-owned vehicle. On Friday, April 7, 2017 the vehicle completely stopped and turned off without a warning in the middle of Sherman Ave. and Wright St. in Newark, NJ. The insurance company towed it to back Autoland in which I was given a rental until the repairs was made. The repairs was never made to my defective engine. Fiat Chrysler said the engine is not covered under the 3yr/30,000 limited warranty. We then proceeded to see if the National Dispute Settlement Center could assist us in the repairs. No they denied it. Not covered under the 5yr/100,000 warranty. 
      I had this car for 361 days before it shut down. I have been walking and using public transportation for the past three months because I cannot afford to replace a engine at 6000 dollars and keep my end of the deal with the loan payments. It will be a class action lawsuit very soon. Too many consumers suffering while Fiat Chrysler are not being held accountable for producing defective products and selling trash for top dollar.",1.0
"I purchased a 2014 Grand Cherokee Diesel in the spring of 2014, right away the catalytic converter failed. To Jeep's credit they bought the car back, and I purchased a replacement. There were some problems, another catalytic converter, water pump, and some other problems, all covered by warranty. The real problems started last fall, overheating while pulling a trailer. Each month from September till February I had overheating problems that were never solved culminating in Bakersfield where the dealer finally discovered a blown head gasket. It took them 6 1/2 weeks till I got it back. I gave up at that point when the car leaked coolant 6 blocks from the dealership. I'm selling the turkey. It was so discouraging, when it ran it was terrific, but so unreliable. I would be ashamed if I worked for that company.",1.0

"I just got a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee from car-mart in St. Joseph, Missouri. I started having problems the day after I got it. First problem: while driving, I rolled up driver's window, the radio popped, turned itself off and back on. Second problem: driving home from work at night, turned the headlights on, the abs light, the brake light and the radio started flashing off and on. Also while that happens, the speed odometer goes to 0 while you are driving and stays there. Third problem: driving home again, the lights and radio start flashing again. The speed odometer goes to 0 again. Fourth problem: started leaking gas from the fuel pressure regulator. Car lot had that fixed.
      My husband and I took the jeep home just to discover, there was no air filter in the jeep. Not very good since I live on a dirt road! We went to get a air filter for it. Brought the filter home and put it in the jeep. I started to test drive it to see if the jeep ran better. Didn't make it far! Now the number 1 injector is running gas so bad that you cannot even start it! I called car-mart to let them know I did not want the jeep. We were suppose to pay 9,000.00 dollars for this jeep. I have had the jeep for 3 days as of 6:30 tonight. My husband put a 1,500.00 dollar deposit down on this jeep for me to have a safe vehicle for winter. Now we are being told that we cannot get the 1,500.00 dollars back! Is there not a lemon law? We are not very happy with this at all! I hope someone sees this that will help me.",1.0
"I can honestly say that I will NEVER own another Chrysler product. Even if someone gives one to me, if I win one in a sweepstakes or inherit one it will quickly be sold. I am a car enthusiast and have owned many, many cars in my 30 years of driving... all different makes, but mostly Fords. I've also restored many 50's - 60's cars and can attest to the fact that cars today are not built nearly as well as they were back then.
      I bought my 1997 Grand Cherokee used, with 80,000 miles on it and at the same time, bought a 1997 Ford Expedition for my wife with 81,500 miles. For comparison sake, the Expedition now has 247,000 miles and I've changed the spark plugs & plug wires (at 200k), and a couple of various gaskets here and there and the alternator (at 225k). All of the power windows and door locks work, the ac blows cold (both front and rear air), it still runs quiet and smooth, still looks good - paint is just starting to fade on the top a little... is a pleasure to drive and I would not be afraid to jump in the Expedition and drive across the country right now.The Grand Cherokee now has 160,000 miles on it and I've had to replace: The radiator (plastic tank blew out), water pump (twice), fan clutch, Crankshaft Position Sensor (twice), head (it was cracked) & head gasket, starter (twice), rear axle (carrier bearing was making a horrible noise now the outer axle bearings on the new axle are whining), power steering hose, bushing on the front stabilizer bar... the freeze plug in the back of the head rusted out (which, I understand was common on the 4.0). It leaks oil and tranny fluid even though the seals have been replaced. There was a primer defect, so the paint is peeling off of the top and hood. The power windows still work, but all of the power lock motors are shot (including the one on the liftgate).The driver door hinge bushings are bad, so the driver's door sags which causes misalignment with the latch and as a result, the super-thin metal on the door has cracked and I had to put some huge washers on there to hold the latch in place. The WORST problem I've experienced with the Grand Cherokee is with the electrical connections - the pins in the connectors on the 3 wiring harnesses that connect to the PCM are like needles, instead of the ""blade"" style connectors that Ford uses. As the plastic ages, the connectors become loose and because of the poor design, this causes a plethora of issues including, but not limited to: intermittent stalling (usually at the WORST possible time, like in the middle of an intersection) and will not start back up for 2 minutes intermittently running rough and backfiring (which usually blows the muffler and ruins the cats), intermittently will not start when cold, etc, etc.So, every 4 months or so, I remove the washer fluid tank remove the 3 connectors from the PCM and clean them thoroughly with electrical contact cleaner and use about 10 heavy duty zip-ties to secure the connectors back to the PCM. Then, and only then, will it run without stalling on me. Maybe! The drain plug for the ac evaporator is poorly designed, so it gets plugged up and water leaks onto the passenger floorboard during the summer time when I'm running the ac and I mean A LOT of water (the passenger floorboard is flooded)! The only way to fix it is to drill a hole in the drain and use compressed air to clean it out (you have to do this once every couple of months). The headlights keep blowing bulbs. I had to remove the plastic lenses and re-seal them with silicone to the keep condensation out. I'm sure I've missed several things - the Grand Cherokees (and possibly other model Jeeps) are just VERY, VERY, POORLY made!",1.0
I bought a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee 75th anniversary edition and recently had a collision with a deer. My care has now been in the shop for 20+ days awaiting parts. The parts are on back order. Why is a new car put on the market and being made without the availability of parts for repair. This is absolutely unacceptable and costly to new owners of cars that may get into accidents. With this sort of policy I fear I will never be comfortable purchasing a new model car ever again and will definitely stay away from Chrysler vehicles.,1.0
My Grand Cherokee keep stalling. It went back to dealer at least 8 times with no answer then it stalled and was in a rear ended accident. Chrysler take to shop and tells me it was a miss fire of no. 2 injector. They never drove it and said they couldn't get it to stall so no repairs. Next week I get a recall my ignition ways bad and would shut the engine off and that's what I had said all the time then over a year later I get a recall on ignition. They have a replacement part put it in and no more stalling so I call and they told by Chrysler Jeep that my cost to repair for the wreck was too bad and will not repair my jeep even though they knew about the ignition stopping the engine and I am out the $4000.00 to repair. This is illegal. They are responsible. I bought it in 2013. They knew in 2009 about it and did nothing till 2016 to get the part and never told owners about it.

"The fix is just a band-aid. I have 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee & had the recall adjustment. The only good this is for is when you open the driver door. However there are times when parking my car; either parallel parking on a street btw cars, pulling in a parking lot or my own driveway in which I was unaware the car was NOT in park but in reverse & I have come close to hitting another car & on 1 occasion a woman walking her dog in my neighbor. I had the dealership look at it & their solution was to JAM the shifter up into park. This is an automatic car not a manual car so that is not how I intuitively drive a car. I also notify Chrysler itself several times without callbacks as I was sworn to have or without any information what so ever.

"I purchased new 2003 Jeep 4.7L Grand Cherokee. At 100k miles it began to fall apart... This is an in town no off road low annual mileage always serviced at the dealer auto.

And a major at new (6 mos in of ownership) failure on 3 separate occasions of the A/C flappers that shift airflow & temperature... Finally involving total replacement. 
      The most dangerous of which is the broken tilt steering wheel adjuster. This would seem would cause loss of steering control and potential driving casualties, especially at HWY speeds...

"My husband and I decided to get the new Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2014. We were so excited we got every feature in the book! We pay a fortune for our lease. In the first year we got around 15-20 letters with recall problems. We made a appointment at the dealer for them to fix the problem we sent it in. We took out money from our pocket for a rental and Jeep promised they would refund us for it. They ""fixed"" the problem and we got the car back only later that year. We were driving up to Virginia and my husband was driving on 75 cruise I had my newborn baby in the back seat and my husband pushed the brake but the car would not stop. Later the whole screen shut off we had to stop the car with the emergency brakes.
      I called Chrysler hoping to maybe get to see a dealer in the area so I should not be driving around a car that can cause a accident God forbid. They told me they couldn't help me and I would need to see the dealer back in NY. When we got back to New York we took the car back to the dealer again they ""fixed"" the problem again we paid for a rental Jeep promising us we would get refunded for it. And then 2 days after we picked up the car from the dealer the engine light went back on. Me who didn't want to pay for a lease of $609 a month plus a rental told my husband we will take it in a different time. Anyways we got more recall letters. Then 5 months later the screen turned off again randomly.We took the car back to dealer after speaking with a case manager they schlepped out their time they didn't care I was paying for a rental not them. My car was there for 30 days!!! I came to pick it up and the driver's seat was ripped. I asked them what happened and they said they didn't do it. So I told them ""Yeah a ghost probably had nothing better to do so he figured he why not let's rip the seat."" I asked to speak to the service manager who was never available to speak to me. Fine I took the car home. The next morning the check engine light popped back up. I took it back to them. They took it off. Later that day it popped up again. Then the auto collision started making short stops on me. I would be randomly driving and there was no cars in front of me and the car would make a short stop really scary and dangerous. I called them back I brought it in again. They took it off againSo I asked them ""Instead of just taking the light off can you see what the problem is and fix it?!"" So the owner told me ""Sorry the mechanic doesn't have time right now but if you leave it here for a couple of days We can do it."" Me who was sick and tired of their **. Called my case manager and asked if I could go see a different dealer. She gave me the numbers of all the dealers in my area. I called them but not one of them would see the car because the car was in the dealer for more than 30 days and no one wanted to deal with anyone else's headache or mistake. I was so pissed I took a lawyer and filed lemon law.I love the Jeep it's a really comfy car but the aggravation is just not worth it. I have another year on the car out of the 2 years that I have this car it's probably been in the dealer for 16 months. Oh and the worst part my case manager called me up and said rental cars are not provisional they are a privilege and Jeep has decided not to refund me for it. So I kind of lost $3000.",1.0

"Purchased a new 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited from Thompson Jeep in Edgewood, MD. Drove vehicle home that evening and noticed the top roof molding strip on the passenger side was missing. Driver's outside mirror case chipped. Went to drive back to dealer and the heated steering wheel became very hot. Could not control the climate control. Vehicle became very hot inside. Vehicle was only 2 hrs old. Dealer did replace all the defective items. Wrote and called Jeep Chrysler concerning these issues. We also recently noticed the carpet near driver's kick panel was not cut correctly and passenger door panel has a jagged edge sticking out. Rear cubby areas in the back rattle and had to have insulation pads added to stop rattle noise. We did this ourselves. 
      We presently have 348 miles on this vehicle and told Jeep Chrysler this is our 5th Grand Cherokee and never had these many problems. We told Jeep Quality Control that a $45,000 new vehicle just built should not have this many issues. We requested a Buy Back and were told this concern would be taken up by corporate office and would let us know their decision. I even filled out a 25 minute opinion letter from Jeep two weeks ago with our dissatisfaction and why. Still waiting on a response from them.Updated on 05/03/2016: We contacted Jeep and were told they contacted our dealership. We received a call from the dealership to bring our Jeep in so the Service Manager (Dave) could discuss the problems. Our Grand Cherokee is supposed to have the upgraded Alpine system. The sound system was actually no better than our 2015 standard sound system. The service manager agreed as he said the very little sound was coming out of the Rear Woofer (amp). We left the vehicle to be checked out. When we came back on 5-2-16, we were told by the mechanic who checked the system that nothing was wrong and that our system was not the Alpine or the serial number information would show on the build sheet if it was. So we left and contacted Jeep service and quality control. Now were waiting to see what system we actually have. We paid additional for the upgraded system.",1.0
"I have a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited that I purchased brand new in March of 2015. It has been plagued with several ""electrical issues."" The very worst is that when you are driving at night the headlamps will intermittently ""SHUT OFF"" leaving you blind in the dark for up to 5 seconds. Even though the dealership has verified this concern Jeep has advised that this is normal. Normal to lose sight for up to 5 seconds living out in the country without street lamps to guide your way on curved roads with deer and other wildlife roaming the roads.
      My second issue is that while driving the clock will lock up in the radio as well as the dash. They told me that they were ordering a USED, REMANUFACTURED RADIO. I told them that I wanted to speak to the manufacturer since it was not a USED JEEP I BOUGHT. After attempting to contact Jeep over 3 weeks and getting no replies, I advised the dealership to go ahead and get the USED unit, even though I didn't agree. I thought we were moving ahead (last Friday). Then I am advised today that Jeep won't allow a new or used radio to be ordered, due to the phone syncing concern that is occurring. I should also point out that none of these issues started until the dealership started doing THE FACTORY UPDATES.",1.0
"On Friday, March 4, after going grocery shopping and coming back down highway, there was a few vehicles and a big gas truck in line at light. I slowed up and came to a stop, applying my brake, and then as if my Jeep, 2003 Grand Cherokee LTD were possessed. It immediately accelerated forward as if in a race smashing into rear of the gas truck, which is like hitting a brick wall. My brother had informed me of this site and I went on and found so many other people with the same problem.
      After reading some of the articles I have to say, Yes, I am a woman and I am not short. Also I have 2 other cars and I have never had this problem with either of them. I have had numerous cars in my lifetime, and I have never experienced this ever happening, only in this SUV. I also have a class B license. I also have a clear driver's license. Something is extremely wrong with these vehicles, and why this is allowed to go on is crazy. If I had not stopped and hit at a higher speed the gas truck could have exploded.

"Regarding Chrysler's advertising showing a Jeep Grand Cherokee cruising through a forest road stating 'it will take you anywhere'. False advertising even for pavement driving. To be fair, 'it will take you there', but beware of potholes and bumps in the road... because it can't handle them. Can you believe it? What's even more astonishing is that most purchasers don't know about this because those that are able to afford the $54k sticker price, only drive the vehicle on pavement.
      I bought a 2015 Overland this December and since then have had the vehicle in the shop twice to fix a loud bump noise heard after the vehicle travels either in a pothole or over something as little as a speed bump. My trips up logging roads left me thinking that the suspension recoil was broken... on all wheels! Several employees of my dealership agree, that this isn't a good thing (the mechanics feel this will cause a lot of damage down the road), but Chrysler considers this to be a 'characteristic' of the vehicle. I took two other 2015s out for a test drive this week and they all do it, just as Chrysler says, its characteristic... If you have the vehicle in the OR1 or especially the OR2 position of the Quadra-Lift Air Suspension, a loud and uncomfortable 'bump' is heard after the suspension returns (compression appears to be fine). It feels like the vehicle is bottoming out.In reality, I suspect that the shocks and/or springs are misspecified for the vehicle. Many visits to the dealership and discussions with customer service have left me with no recourse, thus far. This 'characteristic' is in my view a fatal flaw with a vehicle that should be superior, especially for the price. By the way, it doesn't matter if the Quadra-Lift is engaged or not. However, the 'bump' is even louder with the Quadra-Lift engaged. But don't take my word for it... try it... take any Overland or Summit equipped with the Air Ride Suspension for a test drive over a speed bump or pothole at even five mph and you'll hear a loud bang as the suspension recoils. (Especially in OR2) It is shocking...",1.0

"I am a Marine Disabled Veteran who was finally able to buy a new car. I decided on a brand new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland (5.7 L), all wheel drive in 2013! We paid cash for it! When purchased we were told it had a lifetime warranty and now we were informed it only has a 3 year, 36 thousand mile warranty; What a conniving maneuver! Within months the Jeep began having problems. The emergency brake complete broke within two months after purchase. Months after it was fixed, we were going up on a hillside looking to purchase a lot, and the Jeep completely shut itself off while we going up a hill that a two wheel drive could have easily made it. We were rolling back and the car almost went off the hill. Thank God I was able to turn the damn thing back on!
      Then months later, the Jeep left my family and I, stranded on Highway 580 in California; I live in Nevada! This time the transmission cooler line came off spilling all the transmission fluid everywhere! I was stuck till the Jeep was fixed! They snapped the line back on, refilled the transmission fluid, but they never steamed cleaned the engine where all the fluid spilled. Since that incident, the car has been in and out of the dealership service department for two years with recalls! The leather seats are losing the dye, the back window interior trim piece came loose, and we were constantly complaining regarding the hard transmission shifting and jerking, along with the fuel door being broken, we have been waiting for the replacement door for over a month now.Regarding the engine nose and jerking, they could not find anything; they did the recall maintenance and sent us home. Within a week, on Jan 1st, 2016, the Jeep began smoking in the grocery parking lot during a storm! Needless to say, we were lucky the Jeep dealership was down the street. The Jeep ended up having the water pump, thermostat, tensioner pulley and serpentine belt replaced due to the water pump pulley bearing breaking and thermostat leaking. At this point I think we got a Lemon! However, we were told to buy a lifetime warranty instead! Where is the fairness in this sale? Sad that a Marine can't even buy an American made car anymore and enjoy it for at least a year without having any problems.",1.0
"I purchased this Jeep a 2004 right off a lease in 2007 with 34K miles. Also purchased extended 8/80 covered until 2012 at a cost of $2,500. The lesser problem was I was told they ordered a motor which was covered but it never came in. The real problem is this Jeep has accelerated on its own 4 times and I had to shut the Jeep off and have it towed 3 times, almost killing my family. Once I had to shut it right in front of a railroad crossing. It was towed in 3 times. As I recovered from the trauma - third time and after spending $1,600.00 it worked fine from May 2011 until November 23, when it accelerated and the only thing I could do is shut the engine with the key. It is now sitting in front of my house and I'm scared to death that this will not go away. Fix it again and drive. Scared of my Jeep. Jeep is supposed to make you feel safe and in control. I understand it's not a new a Jeep but, it has 64K original miles and looks great.
      I intended to keep this vehicle, as I am retired and live on a limited income. Now, if I get a car at all it will not compare to a Jeep when it's not malfunctioning. I had a 93 Black and Gold trim Grand Cherokee until 2007, no problems, regular maintenance only. I just realized I had a new battery a Megatron Plus, in Feb 2010 (60 month). The following May the Jeep dealer said my battery had to be replaced, when it was towed in for accelerating on its own and not stopping until the key was turned off. Fast forward to the last incident Nov.23, 2015 the Jeep which usually can stay in my driveway.",1.0
"I have a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland (top of the line model). The entire dash cover ""Leather"" has started to bubble and wrinkle. The stitched seams are tearing apart. Jeep refuses to cover this as a manufacturers defect because of the mileage. The Jeep is 3 years old. Their products are CRAP and their service is awful! I will NEVER buy another Jeep product!",1.0
"I guess a good place to start is the reason why I bought my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland. We love the outdoors - camping, hiking, and exploring the less travelled. We needed a vehicle that could do all that for us and be a comfortable daily driver and have the creature comforts we have come to expect in our Infiniti and BMW. The Grand Cherokee seemed to perfectly fit with what we wanted - it looked great, had 4x4, was quiet on the road, well equipped and didn't get bad gas mileage for the vehicle class. I was a bit hesitant to purchase my first American vehicle since college (that was 20 years ago). But with all the best in class JD Powers ratings in terms of quality, all the marketing around the quality build, and the dealer telling me it was the first and last vehicle to be designed by Mercedes, blah, blah, blah - I thought I made a good decision.
      My first 8 months to a year with my jeep was awesome - we bought into the jeep brand and culture. Several road and camping trips were very fun. The fun stopped however in my 11th month of ownership and a series of recalls, general problems and really bad service at 3 of the 5 dealerships I tried, and in fact, down-right lying about what was done, leaving info off work bills, or just ignoring calls. Below is an honest appraisal of what our experiences were. These don't capture all the issues, just the annoying ones.And before you read, you are probably asking why write this? Well, after hours and hours of phone calls and dealer visits and frustrating run-arounds with no satisfaction I thought I would try this. In general, my family doesn't feel the vehicle is safe and reliable and I have little to no trust left for the Brand, the value it's supposed to provide and very disappointed in the service I have received. Not to mention the days and weeks of lost use and time spent calling people just to get what other manufactures consider basic service.Issue 1: Cylinder Head/Valve Cover replacement under recall (that's what they told me but it doesn't show up in the recall list). 10-11 months into my best time with my Jeep I experienced my first recall and big issue. I brought my vehicle in for routine maintenance at Rancho Jeep in San Diego, CA. During the maintenance I noted that I thought it was running rough and seemed strange. I was told it was probably because it needed an oil change. WTF?! I am not an idiot. So I pushed and demanded they look closer at the issue. It was only then that I was told that there was a recall on my Jeep and though it was no big deal, they were short of parts and couldn't complete the recall at this point.Curious... I pried a bit, since I was planning my annual summer vacation to Tahoe and was leaving that coming weekend. They explained that no big deal recall was a cylinder head and valve cover that needed to be replaced in some models. What?! This didn't seem light to me, particularly when I was driving 8 hours to Tahoe. After much discussion, they discovered there was a part and could do the service but it would take a few days... Yeah, no big deal... Nonetheless, since this was my first issue I was happy that it would be taken care of, despite what seemed a lack of knowledge at a minimum, but felt more like shadiness.Here is where the experience gets great. I picked up my jeep, drove home, packed it up with gear and my two bikes on the hitch rack and planned for my 4 am departure the next day. I drove to Tahoe that day. I headed out for a quick hike up the road and on the way back I noticed steam coming out of my engine and my temperature gauge pinned at H - I pulled over on the street and let it cool down, I opened the hood after a while to see coolant everywhere in the engine bay. Not good. I walked up the road to the cabin and called the dealership. I asked the service advisor if they touched the coolant hoses when they did the service, because I experienced a massive engine overheating. They said, ""no - it was just the cylinder head."" So I did what any curious consumer would do, I googled it! Nope, they were full of it - they indeed had to do that.At that point I asked to talk to the service manager. I explained what happened and explained that it was curious that all this happened after they touched my coolant hoses and cylinder head. He assured me it wasn't their fault - lol. I asked for roadside assistance or something to get me to a dealership, it was my vacation after all. He told me to call a tow company and get it towed to the nearest dealership and I could submit a claim. Ummm, what?! No help on where a dealership was (but I had google), no idea on who to call for a tow truck (thank you again google) and no apology or any other help offered. I asked what I could do since I don't have a car and I am in the mountains on VACATION. He offered no help, or suggestions. None. In fact, the only thing that got me action at all was the few hours I spent on the phone with Chrysler Corporate - they even followed up with me days later to see if I got my jeep back.After an hour of making calls and arrangements with the Carson City dealership (best Jeep dealership I have ever dealt with), I had a pick-up time the next day so I was stuck in the cabin for a day. I called Rancho Jeep back and insisted on transportation of some sort, since it was at least obvious to me it was their fault. They agreed to reimburse me for a car rental. I walked about 2.5 miles to the rental place, rented a car. Note: to this day, I still have not been reimbursed for the rental - I made at least 8-10 calls, left voicemails and mailed a letter and scanned and faxed the receipt. Nothing, just ignored.Ok, the good stuff, the Carson City dealership picked up my Jeep and got it in as soon as they could - turns out I was right! The coolant hoses were removed and just pushed back on when they completed the recall, the clamps were not put on or tightened... F! I had a long conversation with the Service Manager at Carson City who said ""I am so sorry, this is ridiculous that you have had to go through this and get this kind of repair."" He was right. I called the Service Manager at Rancho Jeep and complained about the poor follow-up, service and massive problem I had. I asked about getting my vehicle inspected because it had experienced a massive overheating and was concerned about damage to the engine and cooling parts due to their negligence.After days of calls, again on my VACATION, the service manager agreed to talk to his boss about an extended warranty that they would cover. He insisted it would not be a problem... Hmmm, 3 years later, numerous calls and voicemails, I only ever received one call back that he was working on it - I never received that extended warranty... So net, net - the little negligent experience cost me days of vacation disruption and left me out transportation reimbursement, an empty warranty promise and a vehicle with likely sustained damage due to the overheating caused by the dealership and likely long-term reliability issues... I started to miss my BMW service experience...Issue 2: Vibration at highway speeds. Issue 3: Rattling sound from the suspension at low speeds and stalling. I have taken the Jeep into the dealership twice for this. I noted that it was on semi-rough roads under low speed. They test drove it in a parking lot over a speed bump... ugh. I was even told at one point that these tires and wheels are not made for off road use - WTF?! Funny, I remember the promotional commercials that had this very same overland model scaling rocks and driving in deep snow and sand. I was driving on a gravel road that had been graded. My jeep still makes the noises. No resolution. Funny thing is my friend's 2012 doesn't make any noises over the exact same road...neither does my cousin's 2013. Must just be the driver...Recall 2: Brakes. Recall 3: Visor and Computer Fuel Relay. Issue 3: Driver's seat frame broke. Yes, the frame of the seat. On our way to a family funeral, I climbed into the driver's seat and adjusted the seat back a bit and heard an audible snap and felt something move. And the seat was now feeling like it was on an angle - great. I took it into the San Juan Capistrano dealership (the second best Jeep dealership I have ever been to and likely the only other once besides Bob Baker where I purchased the vehicle that I would ever go). They had the car for the day and inspected the seat and the steering rattling and the dash pad that was starting to wrinkle - more on that later. Sure enough, the seat frame was snapped and they needed to order a new seat frame back.The jeep was now a few thousand miles out of warranty, it wouldn't have been if Rancho delivered on their promise of the extended warranty, but of course they didn't. I was told that it was approximately $1,500 - 2,000 worth parts and labour. WHAT?! I take great care of the condition of my vehicle so there are no signs of any abuse. She agreed to talk to her manager and the district manager to see what they could do. They called back and said they would goodwill it! Yes, good news!Bad news, it would take 3-4 weeks to come in. We were moving up to the bay area in a month so was hoping timing would work out - it wouldn't. So for 4 weeks I drove it only on short errand trips - nervous that the broken seat could be a safety hazard. Because we needed to drive it to Northern California, I asked about the safety and the service advisor said it should be fine - it was the center brace that was snapped and that it should be fine. They saw the condition of the frame so I took their word for it.When we got to the bay area I called that dealer to find out if they could accommodate the goodwill repair up here - they couldn't. And that is when I ran into the worst dealership - Dublin Jeep. I explained what was wrong, they agreed to look at it. They had it for a few days and told me they didn't see anything wrong with it... Ugh... I went in and explained by drawing a picture rather than using words what was wrong with the seat - this seemed to work. They said it was not the whole back frame just the center part and could replace that but it would be $750 dollars... WTF! After 4 hours on the phone someone agreed to do it for a $150 deductible and the part would be in about 3-5 days and he would call me. He didn't call. In fact I left him exactly 7 messages over the course of a week.The seat was uncomfortable to sit in and my back and hip were starting to hurt from sitting on a slant if I drove it for any extended period. The next week still no call. I think it was call 8 or 9 that I waited on hold for an additional 40 min where he came on and said ""oh, hi, I have been busy but the part is in so bring it in anytime."" WTF!!! OK, I chalked it up to him just being bad at his job... After a period of time I picked my jeep up, again unwashed or cleaned in any way (they say they wash your car which is the only reason I bring it up). I drove home and when I pulled into the garage I noticed that the back seat cover was not put on right and the leather on the driver's seat was loose now. I was really upset at this point - the set was broken, making the car uncomfortable and likely a safety hazard and now the seat back wasn't put on properly and the leather was loose, not the way it was when it was brought in.I immediately called and left another voice-mail. No call again so I called back later that afternoon and asked for the Service Manager. He told me that fixing the seat requires him to remove some of the leather seat cover and that is what happens and is a natural result of the repair they had to do. What?! I brought my car in for a manufacturing defect, seats aren't meant to snap under regular use in under 3 years. Upset, I decided to call corporate again. Hours on the phone with corporate in various departments, I logged a formal complaint about the dealership and explained what happened with my seat. I never heard back from corporate but I did hear back from a Manager at Dublin Jeep who now told me the leather wasn't their fault, they didn't touch it to replace the seat frame... Hmmm, Ok. I guess I should be thankful, I have a seat that works properly now...though I would expect that for a $40,000 vehicle.Issue 4: Brakes pulsing and making a balloon sound like air or pressure is coming out at stop in heavy stop and go traffic after driving for greater than an hour. This issue has stopped my wife from wanting to drive or drive in the jeep with our infant. I took the Jeep into the Dublin Jeep dealership (The very worst dealership I have ever been in from a service perspective, just plain awful.). The Jeep was in for several things a few times here - the seat mentioned above, recall for fuel pump relay/computer, general service and the dash part 3. I will focus on the brakes here. I mentioned that the brakes pulse and there is a sound that comes from the engine compartment that sounds like air or pressure is being released from a house or a brake booster or something. It happens when coming to a stop or stopped fully when it has been driven for a while - and it's a little disconcerting to say the least.The service advisor took notes and when the other work was done I picked it up, unwashed of course, and was told that all service was completed. I asked about the brake sound, he said, ""oh, yes that one too."" Drove it the next day and it did the same thing. Called the dealership and spoke with the service advisor. After being told he would call me back three times and did not I decided on the fourth call to just wait on hold, for 35 mins...he said that he double checked and that there is no issue with the brakes. Ummm, I have been driving for almost 30 years and never experienced anything like that. His answer: Jeeps are made with a special pressure relief valve to ensure proper braking under all conditions - what I am hearing is the jeep equalizing the pressure in the system. Ummm, ok... The next day my wife refused to ride in the vehicle.Issue 5: Leather dash. This is one of the most frustrating issues I have experienced. From the original citing of some shrinking on the dash at Tuttle Click that didn't even show on my work bill to Dublin Jeep that said they took pictures and had to send them to Chrysler to have them inspected. I waited for months for an answer back from the service advisor, numerous calls and voice mails left... It wasn't till the seat defect and my calls reached the Service Manager did he look into it and discover that there was no record of any pictures being sent, he even said he double checked! I couldn't believe I spent months checking in, time to drop it off and flat out lied to about what was done. At less than 3 years old, the dash started to shrink and now the covering is loose or coming up all along the window - very frustrating. It has been in covered parking for a good portion of its life and always use a window Sun protector.After several more calls to the dealership and an unscheduled stop by so they could take a look at it - nothing, no resolution. I was told that if I wish to replace the dash it would be just over $2,000. Seriously! If only I had the extended warranty I was promised... lol. As I mentioned previously, I take very good care of my vehicles and driving a 3-4 year old car with under 60k miles around with a funky dash isn't what I signed up for, not to mention all the other problems.Issue 6: Periodic hard starting. It doesn't seem to matter if it's warm, wet, cold or windy - it just happens periodically. Rather annoying. I brought it up during a visit to Dublin but apparently it didn't show on the work order?? Issue 7: key fob works intermittently (yes, we have replaced the batteries). This is really annoying. I don't know how many times I sometimes have to open and close the driver door and re-try the start button to get the car started - our touch and re-touch the door handle to open it.Issue 8: lurching forward when starting. This is my favorite one. I convinced my wife we were only going a few miles on local streets and that even if it didn't start or the brakes were weird that we would be ok. As she was loading my son into a car seat I installed in the back seat for this special occasion of having my family in the jeep, I hit the start button and it lurched or moved forward - not 4 feet or anything but enough to def notice and my wife to get nudged by the door as she was putting him in.Well, let's just say that the short trip in the Jeep didn't happen. Out came the car seat and back into the other car and away we went, no lurching, no clanging, no brake noise or pulsating, and sporting a dash pad that wasn't coming up. Did I mention our second vehicle cost half as much?? Ugh. It also reminds me that had Rancho Jeep actually delivered on their promise of an extended warranty for their negligent work that may be covered.Issue 9: 3 incidents of random stalling of vehicle. Issue 10: Premature wearing and warping of outside bottom window trim. Issue 11: Premature wearing of the carpet where there should be a dead pedal. Ok, this isn't a manufacturing issue just an annoyance - who doesn't put a dead pedal on a 4x4? It's carpet and not a solid foundation either - it started wearing in year two - looks ugly but at least issue 11 doesn't affect the safety and reliability of the vehicle!Issue 12: Clunking of transmission or linkage at stop and start. I have been told by my service advisor this is normal operation. Ok, not sure why my cousins doesn't do this but I suppose it must be a model year thing??... ugh. Issue 13: Daytime driving lights and left rear tail light replacement. Now, I have just under 60,000 miles on the car and I have replaced front lights 5 times and rear tail lights another 5-7 times - strangely only on one side of the car - the driver's side. It started happening after the first year and it seems like every 6 months or so I am replacing lights on the left side of the vehicle...This has truly not been a good ownership experience. I have lost weeks and cumulatively months of use of my vehicle and do not use it for what I purchased it for - exploring the outdoors - for fear it will leave me stranded. I am also very disappointed in the build quality. Dashes falling apart, lurches, brake issues, cylinder head replacements and phantom electrical problems are not what you expect to get when you purchase a vehicle. I hope that this issues list and the fact that I am sharing it electronically brings me some better resolve than the dozens of calls and countless hours has to this point.",1.0
"My wife and I purposely did everything we could to raise our credit scores to purchase a home and new vehicle. We bought a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and fell in love with it. However, 10k miles later the check engine light came on marking the beginning of a fight not in favor to the consumer. Here's why. Jeep offered us three options: vehicle buy back, replacement vehicle, and extended warranty. What I found out was that they won't provide you upfront with details for all three offers. If we don't like one offer we can go to the next, but if we don't like the next one either we can't go back to the former. Basically we are not allowed to make an informed decision. We're getting even more screwed from our lender but that's another review.",1.0
"I purchased Grand Cherokee Laredo my14 brand new from Caroline Springs show room. You guys wouldn't believe this but the car broke down within first 24 hours on the west gate freeway. Issue identified was that fan wasn't working properly and car heated up. Since then car has had several issues and now most recently an extremely terrible noise has started to come from transmission or exhaust with stinky smell and mind you car is still under 2 years old. I just don't have words to explain my frustration. My only advice to people is please do not buy a jeep - it's the worst thing I did in my life. I really hope consumer affairs could do something about this. I'm extremely annoyed. I have got a young family (2 little girls), 2 years and 8 months and all I needed was a reliable car but.....",1.0
"In simple words --- ""DO NOT BUY a JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE OVERLAND"". I had my vehicle for 18 months and it has been in the service shop 8 times, and had 4 recalls. The deepest let down ever. The worst issue of ALL is when you call the Leith Jeep Service Department (NC) it will take many return calls before they answer; they never returned my calls if you leave a message, finally they best line they use is ""I did not check in your vehicle so I have no idea what is wrong"".
      Here is what you get for $60,000: speakers don't work; GPS has been replaced (still does not work); recalls; key fobs (don't work); entry doors won't lock; tailgate won't open; they wipe the system and don't tell you, so all saved data is lost; THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ADVISORS MAKE IT SOUND LIKE YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. I will NEVER buy another JEEP nor make a purchase from Leith Car Dealership. They do NOT care for the customer. This JEEP will be a TRADE IN by 01 JAN 16.",1.0
"My wife and I have a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee altitude v8 Hemi. The truck has been hard to start every morning for a few months and is hesitant every time we go to start it. Four days ago we were driving home and the truck died on the highway. We pulled over and it started back up. The most dangerous situation happened yesterday. As she was merging into traffic on a busy highway yesterday morning her car stalled out and almost caused a pile up. The power steering and power brakes no longer work as most of us know when the power shuts off. Luckily enough I heard about this issue with our jeep that it has been known for so I showed her few days before what to do If it happened and she was ready for it avoiding a life and death situation.
      We called jeep in Southampton NY and they said ""there is no way that could of happened"" so our jeep has been there for two days waiting for a special tech to look at the truck. I love how a person can tell us what happened when we were driving. I'm pretty sure my wife and I were not dreaming.",2.0
"We purchased a new Jeep Compass in June of 2011 from Garlitch Ford Chrysler Jeep in North Vernon, Indiana. Just 33 days later as I was driving to work at 4 am on the highway, the transmission went out. I eventually called the dealership and was given a loaner car. About 4 weeks later, with no call from the shop, we call to find out that the new CVT transmission is ""being looked at by the engineers from Detroit because they have never seen this problem before."" The transmission was replaced.
      Now, 4 years later, the Jeep is having transmission problems again, but nobody seems to be able to figure out what the problem is. It just keeps leaking transmission fluid. Keep in mind, the CVT transmission and fluid can only be checked and serviced by an ""authorized Jeep dealer."" We have tried to take the Jeep back to Garlitch, however they won't even consider trading this Jeep for a reasonable offer on another car (wonder why?) We are so disappointed in the quality of this Jeep. The only reason we bought it was because we have a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee that is the best vehicle that we have ever owned. Apparently the quality has deteriorated in the last 10 years and the customer service at our local dealership is an abomination.",1.0
"I had bought a '07 grand Cherokee in 2013 with 28,000 miles on it so I also got the extended warranty to cover any problems that may occur while I own this vehicle. I took it to the shop with electrical issues and they could not find the problem so they told me it could've been a glitch in the system. Drive it and if it happens again to bring it back after charging me for diagnosis and not fixing anything. Then I'm driving down the road at night and it happens again. When it happens all the lights on my dashboard light up and my headlights go out. This happened 3 different times and the dealer kept charging me for diagnosis and not fixing anything. The third time it went in they told me it COULD BE 1 of 2 modules and they aren't covered under my warranty. Over 1000 for the parts and they weren't sure if it would solve my problem. I will NEVER own another Chrysler again.",1.0
"My wife bought a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, brand new off the showroom floor. She has babied this truck from that day. We started having problems this last year with it stalling out. We took it to our mechanic and he found that the transmission fluid was low causing the stalling, so we got that problem solved and we were getting ready to go to Arkansas in May of this year and my wife stop at her job to drop off some paper work, and came back out to leave - and her Jeep would not start. When she tried to start it, it began to make a loud rapping sound in the motor. Come to find out it blew out the #6 piston. 
      This Jeep only has 66,,000 miles on it. It could be washed and detailed and put on the showroom floor, that's how clean she has keep it, but Jeep will not do anything to help her. Oh they did offer to take her Jeep in as a down payment toward a lease vehicle, which was giving her $1000.00 for it maybe. This is a $14,000.00 truck.Whatever you do don't buy a Jeep, they're junk, and the dealerships and Jeep knows about all the problem with their product, and they don't care. You are just another sucker that they got. We have four Chrysler products now, and have purchase many prior to, but we will be moving to another product. I have GM products with 200,000 miles, but can't get 70,000 out of a $45,000.00 product from Jeep, and the big three wonder why people buy foreign products, because they outlast the payment book you get with them. There are thousands of complaints and the company doesn't care, that's their way to do good business. Way to go Jeep, you'll be in business a long time screwing people. What a great company to look up to, the good old american way.",1.0
"I purchased a new Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2005. In 2009 with 27,000 miles I had to perform significant transmission repairs, which I had done at the dealership (so glad I purchased the extended warranty). It is now 2015 and I have 60,000 miles on my car and I am again having transmission problems. I took it to the dealer hoping they would cop to selling me a car with a faulty transmission and take care of the problem, but no. Instead they wanted to charge me over $4K to replace with refurbished and when I declined, because the idea of paying jeep $4K to fix a problem they created is asinine, the dealership wanted to then charge me $135.00 for diagnosing the problem. Are they nuts? 
      I HATE Jeep!! They manufacture pieces of garbage, with faulty transmissions, electrical systems, ignitions, the fabric on the seats stain with water... I could go on and on. Never again. NEVER! I'm moving on to a reliable auto manufacturer.",1.0
"The Jeep is just a little over 1 year old. It's been in and out of the dealer for a bucket load of problems. The major one is the steering locking up while driving though. We spoke to head office about the steering wheel locking up on our jeep while we were driving and they responded with the screenshot above. We produced a post a lady in the US uploaded having the same problem with the exact same car as our (Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland 2013 MY14) and the dealers treating her like she was an idiot and fabricating the whole thing and their response was the ""Jeeps in America have different parts in the steering."" Are they serious? It's a Jeep that's had the same problem as ours, that you're claiming to be impossible and can't not happen.
      Just for the record (Chrysler), obviously the Jeeps would have different part numbers in America. I'm guessing that having the steering on the opposite side may have something to do with it. Unfortunately for Chrysler, the problems are the same, their cars are crap there as well and the customers are just as happy. Way to go! I want my money back!",1.0
"The Jeep Grand Cherokee has 35000 miles and is currently at the dealer for four days. Before I took it to the dealer, the air conditioning was not performing. I took it to my local mechanic who examined it for two days, and concluded it was an EVac problem. The dealer now has it for four days and advised me today they have ordered a new Compressor and associated parts. No time estimate for repair. And I get a RECALL NOTICE on the car which is a potential death notice. This is on additional notices I have received for other items, at least three. I have owned the car for a year.

"2011 jeep grand cherokee - My jeep has been in and out for repairs constantly for recalls and other failures to my vehicle since I bought it brand new with only 14 miles on it. 1st incident wasn't a recall but a manufacturer defect. They had to replace my whole ignition box. Car wouldn't box start with the push switch or key. Towed in. Recalls, 1st, incident, left cylinder head repair, couple days later receive a recall notice in the mail for this. Now really, dealership said they were unaware of the recall? They are notified before the consumer is. 2nd recall, brake booster could cause additional brake pedal application, force requirement could slow drivers brake application reaction time and cause a crash without warning. 
      3rd recall, sun visor wiring, could cause fire. 4th recall, fuel pump relay, could cause engine to stall while driving and cause a crash without warning. 5th recall notice again, fuel pump relay. 6th recall notice again, brake booster. All these recalls are serious and could cause crashes? Why weren't the vehicles all just recalled? We should have been reimbursed for our vehicles period. They put our lives in danger and never thought to take actions in pulling these vehicles off the market. I've been daily back and forth to jobs not knowing how serious problems my car had till we got the recall notices. I've also been driving little children in my car and this was very unsafe for all of us, not to mention everyone else I had in my car. Consumer affairs really needs to take action on Jeep. Have them recall vehicles. Take it off the road. I've had many more services other than the recalls. I grew up with my parents owning jeeps and they weren't computerized. My Dad still has Jeep Grand Cherokee, the first ones that came out and he had it for his job as a police officer. They were awesome jeeps, mechanics could fix those years if they had to. I love Jeep Grand Cherokees but not this one. HELP US. BELIEVE ME I'VE BEEN PRAYING REAL HARD FOR ALL OF US OWNING THESE JEEPS.",1.0
"Ice buildup - I have a 2006 grand Cherokee about 2 years now. Every winter ice builds in the door walls up to 1 in thick. It even broke the door hinge. Has anyone else had this with there jeep? I can think that jeep would have not fixed this. 
      Stalling out - Stalled out 3 time. So far it been back to the dealer 2 times. They said there is nothing wrong. The last time it stalled, I got in a wreck. I called jeep corp. and was told not to report it to INS. They would take care of it, so now I have to take it back to the dealer to have a inspection on it. I could have Been in a bad wreck. I hope jeep is going to stop give me the runaround this time and fix the problem.",1.0
"I bought a brand new limited 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee in September of 2013 from Fair Oaks Jeep Chrysler and car started having problem and make creaking noises one month into owning. The car would make very loud creaking (almost metal grinding) anytime I went over uneven pavement or speed bumps and got so bad it would creak just from stopping and going. This issue has something to do with the body design and way car was put together. Car also clunks in the back when going over small road bumps. I've been in far less expensive vehicles made by other manufacturers that do not come close to doing this. I informed employee at dealership in service and he told me to my face that the clunking is standard and gave me a Chrysler branded piece of paper stating that. 
      I work for a living so did not have the time to tell the employee what he could do with that branded Chrysler material. When I had more time to make dealership listen (car is only two months old) They took car and addressed. There were issues and replaced the sway bar, shocks, and shock mounts. I had car for 3 day after repairs and it did the same exact thing except worse! The vehicle was violently creaking just going from stop to go. When I had time I went back to the dealership and had the Service Manager at Fair Oaks Chrysler ride in the car to experience first hand what was going on with my defective new Jeep. He looked shocked and really did not know what to say. At that point the only thing he would say is they would try and fix it but would not give me a regional manager's number to address the defects and stated the dealerships could only try and he or not even the owner of the dealership had the ability to get me in touch with corporate except to tell me to contact ""Customer Care"". I called customer care and they got involved and really did nothing to improve the situation. It is just a customer service rep in another state trying to give you LIP SERVICE and updates on what dealership is doing. My car went into the dealership again where they now fully replaced the CONTROL ARMS on my vehicle. Within one week car is exactly back to where it was at before and I am being told customer care again will call me and make it right. Hahaha they call me and inform me the dealership will take car again and attempt to fix. At that point after car going in more than a few times I tell customer care and dealership I want help directly from Chrysler and they both refuse help where dealership says talk to customer care and customer care says there is nothing they can do except help me work with dealership. I found two post cards in my owner's manual for defective vehicle and fill them out and mail in with stamps (This is the process in the technological year of 2015 when you want Chrysler Corporation to address a defect or lemon vehicle!). 2 weeks later I get a Voicemail from a regional parts service manager in Northern VA area saying she wants to address my vehicle's issues but calls me from a unknown number and intentionally does not leave a phone number for me to return call. She called again while I was at work and does same thing and says if I went to reach her to call the service manager at Fair Oaks dealership. I called dealership and the service manager instructs me he cannot give me her work phone number but he will try and ""email"" her to call me back! At this point I have owned my 2014 limited Jeep Grand Cherokee for over a year and half and it has been defective and problem laden since the first month I bought it. Chrysler/Jeep could care less and is just hoping I go away. Worst car buying/ownership experience I have ever been a part of.",1.0
"We recently purchased a new Jeep Grand Cherokee with forward collision alert with braking, The sales people were very vague about how it was supposed to work and we have read all the info in the manual and have tested the feature over and over and it only seems to work when we are using the adaptive speed control with the speed set. We have had this feature on a Subaru and it worked all the time, so I have repeatedly contacted the dealer service department and also Chrysler and they will not respond or return my calls. I finally got Chrysler to call the dealer and have them call me to set up an appointment.
      This vehicle has been at the dealer for two weeks. Chrysler says the FCW Forward collision warning system is working but the mechanic, service assistant, myself, and my wife know and have observed it producing no warning until you are less than 1 car length from a collision or not at all. We had a Simi truck slam on its brakes in front of us and we came within a few feet of rear-ending it, with no warning at all. We were within 3 car lengths before I hit the brakes. The dealer mechanic found the same result and when we purchased this car, we drove other Jeep Grand Cherokees with the same results. These cars are unsafe in that they will not warn you in time to prevent an accident...period. At 50 mph it takes 146 to stop a car and 229 if you add reaction time so car length is not going to prevent a catastrophic collision!The manual says when set to ""far,"" you will get a lot of warnings from a greater distance...we get none. The manual also says the NHTSA recommends the limits these systems are supposed to conform to and I can assure you it is not a few feet! We are in our seventies and this was an extremely important feature for us to have since our reaction times are not what they used to be. The consequence at this time is that Chrysler says it is operating as designed. This is the new way car manufacturers are getting around warranty repairs on ever-increasing costs of major components. They just say it's operating as designed and leave you hanging with no recourse. So I'm to believe that the feature that I paid about $2000 for is not supposed to alert me when a collision is imminent!!! The fact is that they have had so many problems with this feature that apparently they have altered it to the point it is useless.",1.0
"I don't know where to even begin. I bought a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee on 09/14/2013 with 12,424 miles. The Jeep had one previous owner and no reported accidents on the carfax report. My Jeep began to make a really weird noise coming from the engine but wasn't performing poorly. I took my Jeep to the dealership for the first time in October as it had 2 recalls for the brake booster and the sun visor. I explained to the technician the strange noise the car was making and they agreed to look into it. My Jeep was at the dealership for over a week when I called and they told me they were really behind and didn't know when they would be able to fix it. I ended up picking up my Jeep because I could not stay any longer without a car as I was 8 months pregnant.
      I went back on 01/02/2015 after having my baby and I notified them that the noise still continued. I have it documented that the technician performed a ""visual inspection"" and nothing was discovered. They fixed the recalls but were unable to determine anything regarding the noise. They also recommended a tune up and a 3 part fuel service, which at the time I declined. On 01/15/2015 I took the Jeep back to the dealership as the noise was even louder. Mind you, my warranty was about to expire. The service manager ** came out and told me he heard no abnormal noise and that the Jeep was “fine"" he didn't even call a technician or bother to check in my car. He basically looked at me like I was stupid. I explained to him that I know my car well and that something has to be wrong. He sent me away without looking at the problem any further.On 02/26/2015 my car started over heating and leaking orange fluid. I panicked as I had both my children in the car and drove it to the dealership that thankfully was 10 minutes away. This time, I had 4 technicians come out and gave me a preliminary diagnostic stating that the water pump had exploded and they would take a look at it. Sure enough later that day I got call from the service advisor and he stated it was indeed the water pump and asked if I had added coolant to the car as the reason why it exploded was because the wrong coolant was in the car, and it wouldn't be covered under warranty because it was the customers fault for adding the wrong coolant.I notified them that I had never done anything to the car except an oil change and the only place that had ever serviced it was the dealership. They were quick to blame it on Toyota, the dealership I purchased the car from. However, I went to the Toyota dealership myself and got a detailed list of any service performed on the car. The only service performed was an oil change, windshield wiper fluid, and a Texas inspection. I took these documents to the dealership and they now pointed the finger to the previous owner. I found the previous owner and called the one place she took the car to and confirmed they only had an oil change. The dealership then changed their story saying it could have come from the manufacturer with the wrong coolant as it was not mixed like they first suspected.They stated they've received 3 other Jeeps with the same issue, however they were not Grand Cherokees but it was most likely a defect from the manufacturer. They then said they would contact the area district manager to see if they could approve and award the warranty. I called and even went to the dealership because I wasn't getting any response. They finally notified me that the area district manager did not approve the warranty and that I was responsible for the 1300 repair.I was given the number to Chrysler customer support and spoke a representative that assigned a case number and told me I would get a call back no later than one business day. That didn't happen, so I called and spoke to the most awful, rude, incompetent representative named **. He said I was ""misinformed"" and there was no case. He said the area district declined the warranty and they were not going to discuss this issue any further. He talked over me several times and said there was nothing he can do that he has the power to overturn something like this but wouldn't because of the case notes stating the district manager declined the warranty. He was very rude and not helpful. What is a customer support if they don't support their customers?? I requested to speak to the area manager and requested a contact information, and ** told me he couldn't provide that information and that I had to talk to the dealership about that.I am waiting for tomorrow during business hours to go back to the dealership and request that information. Can anyone please guide me on what I can do? I have documentation on everything and no one will even bother to help me, I'm desperate. I will never ever buy a Jeep ever again. Chrysler/jeep has the worst customer service and what they do to people should be illegal. They're negligent and incompetent. They have a quick response for everything to avoid accountability. Jeep is horrible.",1.0
"We have a 2010 Grand Cherokee Limited Hemi and is nothing but a headache!!! From Sunroof leaking, to broken seat belts, to doors leaking and now this.... In Nov 2014, my truck almost overheated and cold air was coming out when I had heat on. I called dealership up and they said truck is not under warranty so there is nothing we can do. So I took truck to mechanic to get the water pump, thermostat, gasket and lower/upper hoses fixed. My bill for this was $758.46!!! I then went online to find out if there was any recalls and sure enough the 2010 Jeep Liberty and 2011 Grand Cherokee had this recall. I decided to call Jeep Headquarters because this just didn't make sense. They were apologetic and refunded us 50% so I was ok with that. 
      Now on 2/27/15 my truck does not want to start...so I call Jeep and again they say ""There is nothing we can do unless you bring it in and we fix it at cost."" Well there is no way we were taking it to the dealership and be charged more than our mechanic. We found out it was the alternator and battery. I once again go online and see if there are any recalls on this and sure enough it's the jeep 2011 and chargers with this recall!! I now called Jeep headquarters to find out what the hell is going on with our truck and why are all these parts having issues....just seems odd that my truck is a 2010 with the same issues as the recall of the 2011...I am waiting to hear back because they are investigating this. I am so very disappointed that I own this Jeep and I have never had any issues with General Motor vehicles I have owned.",1.0
"Purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and in less than a year, I started having problems. It idles but it will not start. I have taken it to the dealer for the same problem 4 times, and it is a fuel pump problem which is housed in the TIPM part. The part has been replaced twice. Today it happened again and I have had it. No one expects this from a new car and much less from an award winning SUV car which is listed as such in all the car magazines including AAA. As a woman, I need a reliable car that doesn't leave me stranded. It lacks reliability, I don't feel safe. I spent a lot of money on this car for this to start happening in its first year. The dealer itself says there is nothing different they can do and are deferring to Chrysler. I got a lemon and I will be contacting Chrysler for a solution to this problem. Wish me luck and will keep you posted.",1.0
"I want to express my concern about an unacceptable problem with my 2014 Grand Cherokee srt8 because of noxious fumes getting sucked into passenger compartment. There is an intermittent problem with smoke getting sucked into the passenger compartment. It smells like oil dripping on the hot exhaust pipe. It doesn't happen all the time but typically it happens maybe once every time I take the car out or maybe every other trip. I have had the car to the dealer at least a half dozen times to try to fix the problem. Each time they have told me they cannot find or duplicate the problem so therefore they can fix the problem.I have found the best way to deal with it is to use the recirculation mode in the cabin air. However even when it's in the recirculation mode at times smoke still comes in especially when I have to stop at a drive-in window and open my window. 
      This is not a minor smell of smoke, these are noxious fumes which water my eyes and give me a headache. In addition to that if I use the front air defroster it sucks in the outside air and many times it's sucking in that smoky air and spreading it throughout the passenger cabin. Furthermore when I pull the car into my garage then exit the car on occasion, and fairly often indeed the car is smoking in the garage and spread the fumes into the house because living space surrounds the garage. I'm in the building industry and it's a well known fact that the greatest source of pollution in the house comes from the garage. To add to the concern I have a child who was born prematurely and has lung problems. It is especially important that the air that he breathes is fresh and not full of noxious fumes.I think I'm a prime candidate for an ongoing purchaser of high end Jeep products. I owned Corvettes, other sport cars, a Porsche 928 s4, and most recently a Porsche Cayenne Turbo. I say that because I am 59 years old, can afford your high end products, and I think I am the kind of customer did you want to keep. I am baffled as to number 1 why the dealer cannot find the problem and number two why the factory is not aware of this smoke problem. I have a hard time believing that my vehicle is the only vehicle you all built which has this problem. I think there's a good chance that someone is aware of what his problem is, where it stems from and how to fix it & I suspect the repair is very expensive. Therefore the plan is to put client's office long as possible so did the repair can be delayed.",2.0
"Jeep has had several recall where parts were unavailable for significant lengths of time. Some were dangerous issues yet there was no urgency to fulfill recall obligations. Currently after a major service visit, I was told that I needed rear shocks for a 2011 Grand Cherokee. However the parts were not available and 3 Dealerships were unwilling to provide a date when the shocks would be in. I was told by my primary dealer that there was a 250 customer backlog for the same car. I contacted Jeep customer care on several occasions without getting meaningful assistance. In fact, they could not locate local parts or tell me what the issue was. I was left with pay the dealership for parts and wait till they come in although no one has an idea when this issue will be resolved. Net net, the Jeep response was"" too bad"" nothing we can do about it. This is absolutely my last Chrysler product.",1.0
"All current and previous problems: Window tint never happened - it was navigation screen. Also on 11/28/14 service details had absolutely nothing to do with turn signals/flashers, rather transmission would not shift out of 3rd gear nor would the vehicle turn off. I had three cars almost rear end me on interstate I-85, all the while my six year old daughter whom is my only child was in the back seat. After our near death experience I have not driven the Jeep as I am terrified for my daughter and myself safety. I'm from the south and grew up hunting, fishing & with 12 male cousins so I'm by far an easily frightened person. 
      After the terror on my child's face I can no longer drive this Jeep so it sits in my garage. The dealership will not return my calls. I have spoken with Ron ** the manager at the local dealership to no avail. He told me since I had no confidence in the safety of the 2014 to pick out a 2015 in which I did then he wanted me to pay 7500.00 more. He should have told me that from the start. I already paid over 40,000.00 for a LEMON that just sits in my garage. I refuse to pay any more money. I'm so dissatisfied with how I have been treated, I want Jeep to do what is right and buy back this vehicle. I'm tired of the run around.

"I recently purchased (10 days ago) a brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Edition. I had a head-on collision with a parked truck and I wasn't exceeding the speed limit (I didn't really see the speedometer but I wasn't speeding). Thankfully nothing happened to me but the car was totaled and the airbags didn't deploy!!! I was given two excuses by the company which locally assembles these cars in Egypt (AAV): (1) the chassis wasn't affected, therefore the airbags didn't deploy, (2) I didn't hit the right spot!

"In late May of 2014 the automatic transmission on my daughter's 2001 Grand Cherokee failed. After talking to a few people that have had transmission repairs and my regular auto service center I decided to have a factory reconditioned transmission installed at the local Jeep dealer (Whitten in Richmond VA.). The main reason for this decision was that my daughter was going to college 300 miles away. After putting down a deposit for the repair the transmission was ordered. I took possession of the Jeep around first week of June. Two days later the transmission failed. The jeep was returned to Whitten and diagnosed. I was told that a drain in the torque converter was stopped up. It took over a week to have this fixed (the transmission had not been registered with Jeep for the warranty to be good I was told). Took possession of the jeep in mid June 2014. 
      Everything was fine until my daughter was returning home from college for Thanksgiving break. She had been on the road about 100 miles when in her words ""it sounded like I was riding over the bumps on the side of the highway."" She took the next exit about 100 yards max then she heard a loud clunk and steam came from under the hood. The jeep was towed to the Jeep dealer in Wytheville Va.. The diagnosis was the transmission had failed due to lack of maintenance on the transmission cooler and would not be covered under the warranty. I was mad. Told the Wytheville dealer that the transmission cooler was maintained buy Whitten Jeep when the transmission was installed. And I was told to have the transmission serviced at 30,000 miles. The complaint went to Chrysler customer service and I was assigned a case number. Went round and round with them about the cooler being maintained, they had an excuse for everything. They finally changed the reason that the transmission failed to that it was external to the transmission and it would not be covered. My hands were tied the Jeep was 200 miles away. About a 800 dollar tow. So I donated the Jeep to Kidney cars. I was trying to minimize my losses. Now I am out of the cost of the repair plus I need to find another car. It will not be a Chrysler or Dodge product. Chrysler's needs to rethink their warranty policy or better go out of business. This problem could have been caused during the install (Was the transmission actually flushed?). If Whitten would back their Rock Solid Service they would of stepped up to the plate and had the transmission fixed. But no the service manager was just as full of excuses as Chrysler.",1.0
"I have had 2 Jeep Liberty's, a 2004 and a 2008. I had some issues with the windows falling into the door and while it was an inconvenience, it was a lifetime guarantee. Since the Liberty was discontinued, I upgraded to a Grand Cherokee, the base model, but beautiful vehicle. First issue was the instrument panel was displaying a ton of indicator lights and then nothing. The vehicle drove, but couldn't tell how fast I was going. I took it to the dealership BEFORE the recall was out. There was another instrument panel recall, then a vanity light which I just had done last month, thought I was done. Last week I got one about the alternator stating that I could lose control of the vehicle or a fire could start under the hood and then today I received another in the mail for the OCR which could mean less safety in a collision. My lease ends in 18 months, I am already researching another vehicle. I have 15,000 miles on this vehicle, I don't feel safe at this moment in time. Although I am calling the dealership, I know the parts will not yet be available. This is not only an inconvenience, but stressing me out. The reason I wanted a new vehicle is so I did not have to worry about major issues. I am paying a decent amount of money each month and I am not satisfied at all.",1.0
"I own a 2013 Grand Cherokee. When traveling approximately 55-60 miles per hour on the highway, the kayak attached to a Thule rack that was clamped to the factory-installed flush roof rail flew off the vehicle and hit the car behind me. That driver slammed on the brakes and cars behind swerved left and right to avoid an accident. The factory installed flush mount rail had pulled right out of the roof. The kayak weighed about 70 Lbs. (rail is rated for 150 Lbs.). The Thule rack was specific fit for this vehicle. The rack and straps were still attached to the kayak once retrieved from the high speed lane. The rail was the only failure.
      This was immediately reported to Chrysler/Jeep. Went to local dealer and had them take pictures and inspect vehicle. Chrysler/Jeep comes back saying they take no responsibility, that this is not a warrantable defect-failure caused by wind pressure?? I have owned many vehicles from station wagons to SUVs that have never had issues hauling kayaks on the roof. You cannot go for a drive without seeing kayaks or canoes attached to all sorts of vehicles driving on the highway. Wind pressure? Really? This accident could have caused serious injury or even death if the kayak had gone through the windshield. It almost caused a chain of collisions.

"I have a 2005 Grand Cherokee 4.7 Quadra track 2. Has proven to be the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Interior door panels fit poorly. Passenger rear managed to catch door frame and ripped. Yes, a plastic door panel ripped. 4wd computer was not functioning properly when stuck, with the traction control off. The jeep would try to do an emergency lane change, as per the esp system.
      I have for the first time had to walk out of the bush. N23 recall fixed it but has caused its own issues. Old parts with new soft wear. Not a good combination. Pulling the fuse resets the computer and allows it to shift into low range. How's that for a high tech fix, lol. Small fuel tank. You may be able to get to the trailhead. Just not with enough fuel to drive the trail. Or possible get home.At all speeds higher than a walk, it throws any water or mud you drive thru onto the windshield. Fragile exhaust manifolds warp and break the bolt heads off. Jeep has never bothered to improve. Occurs on 3.7 and 4.7. Good thing they stopped building these headlight switch. Leaking power steering pump. Plastic tub from reservoir to pump wears from vibration. Driving thru snow like you see in their commercials, stalls my Jeep. Never have been able to find the problem. Jeep tech in Winnipeg told me to clean and grease all electrical connectors due to poor sealing qualities. Went in mud and vehicle started missing. Which is what got me talking to the tech.

"We bought a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland last October. I was so excited about my new to me car. It was so pretty and so many options. I couldn't believe I was driving such a nice car. About a month ago, I noticed that the leather on my dash was starting to pull up from the actual dashboard and starting to bubble. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the entire driver side dashboard leather was pulling away from the dash and bubbling in a number of places. We took it to the Jeep dealership and the guy took pictures. He said he will contact Jeep and see what he could do. 
      That was 3 weeks ago. We never heard from him again... We emailed and just got no response. Finally, my husband called Jeep today and they told him there is nothing they can do. The vehicle has 62,000 miles on it so it's not covered under warranty... BUT the warranty doesn't cover trim anyway! While I understand that my Jeep has over 60,000 miles, what I am saying is that the leather shouldn't EVER pull away from the dash and if it does, how could that possibly be my fault?! It looks like they ran out of glue at the factory when making my Jeep. I am currently trying to figure out if I can afford to get rid of my Jeep. I know that what I am dealing with is not a safety issue but if Jeep isn't willing to help us out with something little like this, it seems unlikely they will be there for us if something worse happens.

"On 05/24/2014, we bought our first ever BRAND NEW car, a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4. We were so happy... until the new car smell wore off after 3 weeks and was replaced with a rancid, putrid odor. Ten day wait to get into the dealership service department only to be told it was mold/mildew in the a/c system. They kept the vehicle all day to ""flush"" and ""sanitize"" the system. Released it to me with the overpowering smell of sweet cherry air freshener and advice to turn off the max a/c about 10 minutes before we reach a destination and plan to return annually for a similar treatment. Imagine our surprise when 7 days later, the smell was back.
      Growing concern for our health as breathing mold spores can lead to chronic health issues, we called Jeep, opened a case and took it to another dealership (another 2 week wait). As would happen, they could not recreate the smell. We've narrowed it down to weather, temperature conditions, creating the prime environment for it to occur as it has happened since then. Jeep has been fantastic about following up and wanting to resolve the issue but I'm concerned about future health issues and exposing our child to this.",3.0

"After delivery of my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland on September 2013, I noticed exhaust smell in cabin while driving on the highway.

I was able to reproduce the problem while driving on highway with the sunroof tilted open, driver side window slightly opened and gas pedal depressed. The exhaust fumes would be mild to severe enough fumes where I would have to stop and exit the vehicle.

When installed by them, they whistled/moaned at speeds above 40mph. Unable to correct this annoyance, they simply returned my money with no other effort to locate another. My complaint is that no effort was made by either Jeep or the dealership to provide me with an accessory that, in my opinion, should be standard on what is supposedly the ""iconic"" off road vehicle.",1.0
"I'm taking the Jeep into the dealership tomorrow but I bought a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo in Oct 2013. It is now April 2014 and I am very concerned. A few months ago I noticed that when I accelerated at low speeds it was very jerky. I had the instrument display recall to go get done so I mentioned it to the dealership. When they learned that I didn't have an indicator light they literally said ""crap, it's so much easier when we can catch it in the act like that"". When I picked it up that afternoon they informed me that they had spoken to Chrysler about another customer's vehicle and learned that a part would be available in May for the exact same problem. They admitted I wasn't the only person having the problem and it wouldn't hurt my car but since it was new everything should work right. We decided that I was to bring it back in later for an oil change and the part.
      A month later, all the sudden the shifting is a lot worse. Have you ever pushed a grocery shopping cart that had something on the wheel? You can feel it isn't turning and your trying to push through that dead part to get it going again. That is the feeling I get when accelerating after driving about 20 minutes. I accelerate and my speed increases but the RPMs don't. When I watch the gears they barely change. It most often stays at 7 or 8. Once I realize that it isn't shifting as well as it should I usually let off the gas and get the same feeling as it slows down. It is almost like it feels tight trying to increase or decrease speed.I called and left a message for the dealership and will be bringing it over on my lunch break tomorrow. I have an automatic V-6 and am a novice when it comes to car knowledge. I can change my own headlights, air filter, wipers etc... but I take it in for oil changes and anything beyond that. I'm just hoping that I wasn't wrecking my transmission by continuing to drive it because the tech said the problem wouldn't hurt anything. On a different note, I've noticed that when I get to 1/4 of a tank the acceleration is affected and it doesn't respond as well. The same thing goes as it gets close to needing an oil change (3,00-4,000 miles).Besides the gas mileage not being as high as advertised I'm really pleased with the car. I drive 25-30 miles each way on the interstate going to work so I'm very concerned about this and trying not to scare myself.",3.0
"After reading other people's problems here, mine may be related. I have a 2011 Grand Cherokee Limited with the Hemi 5.7. It's my 4th Jeep and 3rd G.C. I have enjoyed the others and obviously didn't have any major problems. NO MORE. When this G.C. was new, occasionally a large blue cloud of smoke but it wasn't often. 4 months ago it wouldn't start in the mornings, and the service engine light and the red electronic light came on so I brought it to the Jeep dealer. They told me I needed a tune up and upgrades to the on board computer. This cost just shy of $1,000. 4 months later the problem comes back so I bring it to a local trusted mechanic. The 2 fuel pumps are ""burned up"" because the integrated power control module has failed. So I'm looking at about a $1500 bill. All this, I believe because the dealer's repair shop couldn't diagnose the problem. Should this be recall?",1.0
"I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited w Hemi. I have nothing but issues with the catalytic converter since I purchased it (I am sole owner). I am about to move onto my 3rd Catalytic converter as the first 2 failed and Jeep will not cover the 3rd as they say it is out of warranty. They want 1800 to fix it. I am in CA and there are no aftermarket cat's approved here (I called the useless CA Public Information Helpline and they said they don't care) so they, JEEP, are trying to stick it to me. I am wondering if anyone else is having the same issues. I saw the class action lawsuit relating to the catalytic converters for 1999 -2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee models and am curious if they did not actually fix anything for the following years either. I am ready to stir the pot, so let me know if you also have catalytic converter issues.",2.0
"Bought a new '13 Grand Cherokee Overland a year ago. Initially, I loved the car. In fact, I still love the car if it didn't have problem after problem. It has been in the shop nine times at this point. Granted, I have nearly 35,000 miles on it; but nonetheless, that is ridiculous. A lot of the repairs were minor--sensors for the gas tank, another sensor for something else. Still aggravating as you don't expect to have to take the time to take your new vehicle to the dealer so often. But then I had the vehicle not start on me several times. It is a push button start and it would just try to crank without turning over. Took it in and they said they fixed it. 
      About 1,000 miles later, the same issue happened again. This time, me and my wife are in North Carolina on vacation. Wouldn't start on me. Couple days later, the remote start started it and then when we got in and hit the push button, it was like a system fail--it wouldn't start into gear, then it shut off, then the alarm went off and wouldn't go off until my wife opened the door. Then we hit the button and it tried to crank again without starting. We waited a couple minutes (as we had learned to do when it wouldn't start several times before) and then it started. This was while we were in Carolina on vacation without four wheel drive. About a week before we left for vaca, I was out on some property I own getting ready to show it to some prospective buyers when the 4wd light comes on. I didn't get stuck but I had to work my way out of this dirt drive up a hill. Dealer/service said it was a gear and a sensor on the transfer case. We also have some property out in the country in the Carolinas (similar to the country acreage we have here in Ohio) and we planned on our vacation to visit this property, walk it a bit, take some pictures and get ready to sell it. They couldn't fix the 4wd before I left on vacation so I didn't bother going to look at these other properties in the Carolinas while we were there. I'll have to make an entirely separate trip for this sometime now. Maybe we could have made it out to see the properties without needing 4wd but having almost got stuck already and then having it not start on me I didn't want to risk this out in the middle of nowhere in a state where I knew no one. Anyhow, the 4wd is fixed now. They subsequently replaced the computer board, or something like that, that controls all the electronics--they said this was to blame for the starting issues. Next in line, issues with the lighting system--blinkers not working right, fog lamps not working (I actually suspect this was the Jeep dealer that did this on one of my previous services--I took it to the same dealer for each of these problems). They fixed those last week. Now, having been in the shop 9 times for minor and major things, what can I say? Obviously annoyed. My wife did not want to buy a used Jeep because she wanted something reliable--she did not want to have to worry about just these kind of issues. And the 4wd not working!!!!! It's a Jeep. This was the first Jeep I bought and I do a lot of traveling for work--mostly back-roads and in some rougher terrains. I bought this Jeep for just this reason. Got the Overland edition because I wanted all the bells and whistles. And then I am still going into service for repair on a regular basis. Bear in mind, I do not treat the Jeep rough--I utilize the 4wd but I do not off-road. Oil changes and tire rotations every 6,000 like they recommend. With all of that said, I have the Hemi that performs great. I have a luxurious cabin in Saddle Brown leather that is crazy comfortable. The ride in this vehicle is amazingly--shockingly-- smooth! I would be absolutely 100% satisfied with this vehicle and its cost if I didn't keep having these mechanical and electrical and whatever other kind of issues. I am still outraged that the 4wd on this thing went out--it's a Jeep!!!!! I had it less than a year. I will say that the bluetooth system sucks as far as the hands-free phone is concerned--the Sync system in my Ford is far superior--but that is the only thing I would actually change in the Jeep I have (other than wanting it to be reliable). I still gave it 3 stars for value because I swear the luxury and capable and ride of this thing rivals that of luxury brands for a fraction of the cost. BT--I looked into the Lemon laws as far as seeing if I could get another vehicle that did not have these issues but gave up on that when I realize they depreciate they value on how much I have already driven. With 30,000 by the time I thought of this I realized that even with a fight and a win I wouldn't come out ahead as I wouldn't have the money to get a new one after they depreciated the value from the miles I have already driven. Hopefully all the kinks are worked out now though, hopefully!",1.0
"After purchasing my new Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit on 12/21/2013, I was a very happy Jeep owner... that is, until it broke-down Christmas morning 12/25/2013 with the transmission going out completely! The vehicle is at the dealers and they are waiting for Chrysler to help resolve the issues with a projected completion well into the New Year. I have asked for a new vehicle from the dealer but the dealer I purchased from told me - understandably - that they can't do anything and Chrysler needs to get involved.

"I have been complaining about the transmission of my 2014 Grand Cherokee limited to my Dealer few times.

"My 2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee began stalling in traffic 2 weeks after replacing my electronic key replaced at the dealership. My vehicle has become a death trap, stalling while driving or stopped in traffic or at a light. I took it in two days ago for diagnosis and repair to find there was no definite fix rather a course of trial and error. I was told it could be one of many possibilities, since computer diagnostics did not display codes typically telling of the cause. Recommendation was to start with replacing the spark plugs since it also happened to be a scheduled maintenance item and also could trigger this problem. The next day it stalled driving down the street. Today the vehicle stalled in traffic. The malfunction light came on and will not turn off. The incident came short of the vehicle behind me swerving to prevent hitting me in the rear. I have checked several websites for answers to the problem, and found this is a common issue with Jeeps. It seems Jeep dealership service centers, independent shops and technicians are familiar with this problem plaguing but are not equipped with a firm fix.",1.0
"I purchased a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland (5.7 HEMI) used January 2013. Since purchasing, the vehicle has had a stalling problem. The Jeep stalls on the freeway, when in traffic, in parking lots, and when driving just about anywhere. Currently, it has been at a Jeep dealership for the past 2 months and 1 week while they attempt to fix the problem. This past Friday, after receiving the needed parts, the Tech advised me that the Jeep stalled again on him during a test drive. He told me I should ""trade it in"" and ""make it somebody else's problem"". The Jeep still is sitting at the dealership. It cannot make it 1/2 a mile down the road without stalling. In fact, the last time I drove it (August 22nd, 2013) it had stalled after accelerating suddenly and I almost ran over 2 children.

"Purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee in July 2013. After the first 1000 miles, I drove to work and parked. When leaving, the Jeep would not start and after verifying various things with the dealership, they sent a tow truck and had it towed in. Turned out that there was some wire that was pinched under motor mount bracket (?) and that fixed the problem. Less than 500 miles later, the ABS module went out and all of the displays were gone and the car was beeping until I drove to the dealership and they changed out the ABS module. 1000 miles later, we noticed that the passenger fender bracket was broke and the fender was sticking out. 
      The dealer replaced the bracket. They also fixed the hatch door which was not aligned correctly. One side had a larger gap than the other side. During all of this, multiple computer updates had to be done every time we took the vehicle in for repair. Finally, at less than 6000 miles, the car started to have this intermittent squeaking sound coming out of the engine and as it turns out, Jeeps have a problem with water pumps.

"About a month ago, my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited started having this same stalling problem. It is very random, happens whenever it feels like it, and is becoming very dangerous for me, my family, and other motorists. I have almost been sideswiped, or rear-ended, or run over by other drivers several times now, after replacing a part, and thinking the stalling will stop, then the Jeep is stalling again. I have had it looked at by a few mechanics, have replaced parts they say are defective, but the problem still continues.When it stalls, the gauges all go to zero, the sentry key light comes on, and the low fuel light comes on. The check engine light never comes on, and there is never a code when checked. The engine will crank by key, but there is no spark, or fuel. It's like the computer dies. Sometimes it will restart right away, and sometimes it won't.
      After continuous reading on the internet, I have found that thousands of Jeep owners are all having the same problem. Continuous random stalling of their Jeeps. Some have spent loads of money throwing parts into them, because mechanics refuse to find the real problem. All the mechanics do is look at the simple things, and then think to themselves ""This guy will be back again... I can make more money..."" So the real problem is overlooked and other items are being replaced for no reason. And in some cases, the PCM is replaced multiple times before the problem is solved. Many people don't have the money to keep throwing parts into this problem, and even more people don't have the money to replace their Jeeps. If the Jeep Manufacturers knew they were using crap parts, then now is the time for them to step up, stand behind their name, and help their consumers overcome this problem. Because if it weren't for the consumers buying their products, they wouldn't be in business.",1.0
"I purchased a new 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo X with 5.7L. I noticed right away the jeep vibrated/surged from speeds of 50-75 mph. The dealer service tech had not experienced this before. Service did a software update, however no change, and still no idea what was wrong. The next service call, the dealership changed out the plugs and coils, still no change. Through frustration I got a Chrysler case manager involved to help resolve the problem. The case manager suggested I get a 2nd opinion from another Jeep dealership, so I ended up going to 3 dealers and 1 independent mechanic. They all said the same thing; there is a problem, but not sure what it is. 
      Still working through the case manager, I asked to get the issue resolved and noted that this vehicle is my office, and I normally drive 200 miles per day, so the chugging and vibration is real annoying. After visiting the 4th Jeep dealership and test drive, the tech looked up info for tech updates on the Chrysler website looking for anything on this engine and vehicle and found a Star Case Report that described exactly what was wrong. The Star Case noted engine chugging from speeds of 40-80 mph, and the PCM software update would not be available until after 1st quarter of 2014. So I will have had this vehicle for 1 year before it is fixable; however Chrysler says this is normal operation of this vehicle. I asked Chrysler if the engineers designed the 2013 Jeep Cherokee to Chug and Vibrate in the normal operation of these speeds, and the Chicago District Service/Parts Manager replied as normal operation. If I understand the Chrysler Mission and Vision Statement - ""Build cars and trucks people want to buy and enjoy driving and will want to buy again."" Sorry, but I don't enjoy driving a vehicle that chugs and vibrates.

"Where do I begin with this Jeep? Well for starters I bought the Jeep with 50k in 9/2011. That same night driving it home from the dealer, it stalls on me. Bring it in and they can't duplicate the problem and pretty much tell me I'm crazy. Well we are in 9/2013 and it has been to 2 different dealerships 7-8 times for this same issue. I have lost count the amount of times that it has stalled on me driving on the highway, stopped at a stoplight, drive thru or many other places it has decided to shut off on me. Every time I take it to the dealer they test drive it and look for bulletins. Some of the times that I have brought it in they have replaced the coils, spark plugs, flashed some software, replaced a module or just have said nothing is wrong with it. 
      Well Chrysler it's time to wake up and look into the thousands of complaints that are online and in your dealerships. I have almost been involved in several accidents due to this issue and I am not the only one. Is Chrysler waiting to have over 200 deaths like in the Jeeps with the fuel tanks in order to do a recall? Never again will I buy a Jeep. I will tell everyone that asks how do I like my Jeep the truth - that Chrysler does not stand behind its products and produces death traps. This is my second Grand Cherokee. I was a pretty loyal customer and was planning to buy the 2013-2014 but after seeing all the issues with that model I am going to GMC or Chevy. I also have a 1997 GMC Sierra with over 187,000 and have not had one issue with that other general maintenance like brake pads, spark plugs, oil changes, and air filter. I suggest that everyone that is having this issue contact Chrysler and the NHTSA to file complaints.

"Took our 2006 Grand Cherokee into dealership to have the transmission repaired according to the recall instructions. Ten days after repair, we attempted to disengage the transmission in order to tow behind the motor home. It would not go into neutral. Could not tow. Returned to the dealership, 50 miles away, and they said it was the actuator fuel-control and we had to pay for the replacement, $616.00. Had to pay as we needed to tow the car. Complained to Chrysler/Jeep. They responded, because we are a good customer, they would refund $495.00 for good will only. They claim it was not their doing. When we took it in for the recall, it was because the transmission would go into neutral by itself. After repair, it would not go into neutral, but just a co-insentience! Nothing to do with them.
      We were promised, if they see a pattern, they will refund the remainder of the money. So far, we have found another motor homer that had the exact problem and had to take it back. They did another computer adjustment and was able to get it working again without the replacement. Not sure what that means.My warning to all re-call fixes, check to see if your Jeep will go into neutral or 1st gear after repair. Most of the time we do not check to see if it does. If it does not, take it back and demand fix. They are not being honest with us!",2.0

Taking back to dealer today to see if I can replicate problem. Only does it when trans is warm. Had it in once already and they did software update - did nothing to fix problem. They have a real problem here that has not yet come out.,1.0
"Suddenly Accelerated 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee: The Jeep was parked on the street in front of our home. I wanted to move it from the street into our driveway one evening, like I have done hundreds of times before. We have 4 vehicles in our family and we need to park them so whoever is working can get out the next morning.
      I started up the Jeep, had my foot on the brake. I put the Jeep in drive and it pulled forward without needing to use the gas pedal. I just road the brake, I only went about 5 feet forward. Then when I put the Jeep in reverse, and again planned on only riding the brake into the driveway, but instead when I went to put the Jeep in reverse, that's when the Jeep peeled out going backwards. The engine roared loudly, and I could not believe what was happening. I made sure I was pressing only the brake, and I was, but the Jeep would not stop.I was pretty much standing on the brake and could NOT STOP the Jeep. I ended up hitting 2 other parked vehicles in our driveway, then knocking down 3 sections of a 6 ft stockade fence. Then the Jeep drove into our neighbor’s yard and damaged our neighbor’s cars. Thankfully, when I hit their car, it hit it sideways so it helped the Jeep to stop; otherwise, I would have driven through their house.When it was all over, I was a bit confused knowing I did nothing wrong. I could feel the brake because it was much larger than the gas pedal. And NO, the floor mats had nothing to do with this accident. That evening, I looked on the computer to see if I could find problems with braking in Jeep Grand Cherokees, and found so many stories like mine, especially this problem happening in driveways, parking lots, car washes. It seems to be when you first start it up and put it into reverse or drive. It's called Unintended Sudden acceleration and it's been happening for many years. Diane Sawyer did a TV special in 1997 and it's still going on today. This is dangerous and lives have been lost due to this problem. I have moved this vehicle many times before and again did nothing different that night. It's not fair that I now have to pay a surcharge when I did not cause this accident. There needs to be a recall on these Jeeps. This Jeep was bought used about 1 year prior to the accident , and we will never know if the other owner had this same problem.",1.0
"2014 Grand Cherokee Overland Clunk Box: First and probably last experience with Jeep: Threw down 50k for my new Jeep, and after 200 miles, the transmission clunks from 2nd to 1st. Brought it to the dealer and they compared it to another, and felt mine was more aggressive. They did nothing to fix the problem and said to drive it longer. Did, and now it's worse. Brought it to the dealer, and they had it all day but fixed nothing. B.S. They did not even drive it a mile. Said that someday there might be an update. WTF? They claim on TV that the 2014 Grand Cherokee is ""The Best of What We're Made Of"". What a nightmare!",1.0
"I purchased a new Grand Cherokee Limited 4X4 in 2008 along with a Service Contract (which was sold to me as a warranty). The extended warranty is for 100,000 miles. At approximately 76,000 miles, the vehicle began stalling at highway speeds during my daily commute (40 miles each way). I contacted the NHSA and Jeeps Service department at our local dealership. The engine failing while driving 70 miles/hour is scary; I lose power steering, along with control of the car. Fortunately after putting the car in park on the side of the road, it restarts without hesitation, and I am on my way.
      I took the vehicle to the service department World Jeep in Shrewsbury, NJ in November 2012 after the first few occurrences. I paid the deducible; they changed some parts and sent me on my way. 2 weeks later, the problem returned.After 6 months, 7 trips to the dealership, and multiple parts being changed, the car is still undiagnosed and still stalling at highway speeds. Since I believe this to be a serious safety issue, I have not put my children in the car. I have escalated to the Chrysler Executive Group (both Customer Service & Quality divisions) on separate occasions. I feel that a reasonable amount of time and attempts have been made to rectify the issue. My family has been patient and cooperative, even after being asked to continue to drive the unsafe vehicle with an on-board recording device (The device failed to record any data when the car stalled twice while the unit was installed).We are at a loss as to what to do.",1.0
"This is a two part concern: My first serious concern is regarding my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Uplander. I had hit a slight bump while travelling down highway 391 and my air suspension bags broke. My vehicle is fairly new with a little over 80,000kms. I am aware we have had cold weather and may have contributed to the air suspension failure. My second concern is my vehicle has been in the shop since February 8, 2013 for my air suspension bag to be replaced which, to my knowledge, is covered under warranty. 
      According to the service department, the delay (for two months) has been the ordering of parts. The service department first ordered one air suspension bag, and then later realized that two air suspension bags were required. They then further realized that additional air hose/rods were needed to connect the air suspensions - this also caused another delay. These are currently on backorder. I am hoping these concerns are investigated and that appropriate measures are taken to ensure that vehicle owners are not at a loss without a vehicle for 2 1/2 months with no other recourse for vehicle usage.",2.0
"I dropped off a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee at a Jeep dealer on October 1, 2012 to have the smartbeams and a trans. over temp light repaired. The repair of the over temp light took the dealership three (3) weeks to repair, after they had to remove the transmission to repair it (they damaged while fixing the light issue). They started fixing the smartbeams on week four. They tried calibration, which didn't work. Jeep engineering told them to try a different Front Control Module which they did and resulted in no change. A good part was swapped with a good part. Jeep engineering told the dealership to try changing the Steering Control Module, again with the same results. The dealership and Jeep stated that because the parts are electrical, they cannot be returned and I must pay the $1,653 for the modules which is the dealer cost, their mark up and labor to install.
      After 10 weeks in the shop and still not repaired, the dealership had a technician brought in who was supposed to be an expert. He worked on the vehicle for another day and declared it fixed. In order to get my vehicle back, I had to pay the $1,653 or they would not release my vehicle. I paid the amount under protest. I took the vehicle and found that the smartbeams still were not working! I reported this problem back to the dealership 3 days later and asked what they were going to do about it. I was told that they would again have the expert technician take a look at the vehicle on Jan. 11, 2013. I was assured by the dealership, in writing, that there would not be any additional charges for this work.I dropped off the vehicle on Jan. 11, 2013. I called the dealership at 3:45pm asking if the Jeep had been fixed and as well that I wanted to pick it up. I was told that the expert technician was not able to fix the problem but felt that the rear view mirror (containing the camera and electronics for the smartbeams) needed to be replaced. They were waiting confirmation from Jeep as to this diagnosis. Today is January 15, 2013 and I have not heard anything back from the dealership or Jeep. This repair started on October 1, 2013 and is still not resolved. Three and one half months!? That in itself is ridiculous. I am still attempting to recoup the $1,653 for good parts that were used to replace good parts. If all of the above was not enough, I challenged the first invoice I received and it was adjusted due to incorrect entries. I received a partial refund. I challenged another part I was incorrectly charged for, and after providing proof to the dealership that I should not have been charged, I will be receiving a refund for that part, $53. The dealership service manager and owner are indifferent and simply do not care about resolving this issue. I logged a complaint with Jeep customer service, and they are indifferent as well as the Jeep is not being serviced under a warranty. The issue is fair trade practices, competency and ""Doing what is right.""",1.0
"I just purchased my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland on 11/31/2012. It is not 01/04/2013 and I have stalled and almost crashed a number of times. On Jeepforum.com, you can see a 53-page long complaint of hundreds of 2007 Grand Cherokee Overland owners with the same problem. In 2008, the 2008 Jeep Commander was recalled for engine stalling at high speed and during deceleration. This problem was not just limited to the 2008 Commander, but the 2007 Grand Cherokee Overland as well. I keep stalling, had complete loss of power and almost crashed into a guard railing twice.
      I stall on major highways doing about 60 mph but the vehicle only experiences loss of power for a split second and restores itself. However, during idling and or reducing speed, the vehicle stalls and I have to restart it. This is very dangerous and mechanics nor Jeep service department have no idea what the problem is. We need a recall. Will it take an accidental death for Chrysler to finally realize they need to recall our vehicles? This is obscured.",2.0
"I purchased my 2007 Grand Cherokee Overland 5.7L on 11/24/2012 and 4 days after my purchase, my vehicle stalled while accelerating from a stop. The SUV completely shuts down with a check engine light as well as the TCM light showing on the dashboard. The fault code shows P0884. After doing some research on the Internet, I have come to find that this is not a new issue. On Jeepforum.com, there are 51 pages of this discussion with hundreds of consumers having the same issue. Some consumers have stated that the only solution that seems to fix the problem is by wrapping certain wires with aluminum foil. Another consumer said after bringing their Jeep in for service for this stalling problem, Jeep Service Department actually wrapped some wires in aluminum foil and sent them on their way.
      Although this temporary solution seems to be working to fix the problem, and I emphasize the word ‘temporary’ because I don't quite see aluminum foil to be an effective long term fix for this stall, how could the service department at Jeep consciously send a consumer home with an ""aluminum foil fix""? I see that my year make and model has not been recalled for this issue yet and I assume that is because not a single person at Jeep has a clue what is causing this stalling problem; therefore they don't have any idea how to fix it and that worries me. As a devoted and long term Jeep owner, previously owning a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, I will be very skeptical about purchasing a third Jeep in the future if they can't seem to figure out a fix for this problem. I have noticed that the 2006 and 2008 Grand Cherokees were recalled for stalling problems, but why not the 2007?",2.0
"On 10-24-2012, I drove my diesel 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited to Flagstaff, Arizona for routine service. I tried out Planet Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Flagstaff today for a routine oil and tire rotation. When I drove away through their parking lot, I noticed a strange sound from the front end. Once I entered the roadway and drove about 2 blocks away, I was convinced something was wrong. I made a u-turn just past the raised medium and I could tell the tire was slipping off the car. I immediately stopped and took a picture of my left front tire with no lug nuts. I called the service manager, who responded about 10 minutes later, with the alleged mechanic who worked on the vehicle. 
      Jose stated he used the airgun to tighten two times my rim lug nuts. We left my stranded vehicle so they could return with tools to bring the vehicle back to the shop. We stopped in the road to pick up a trail of four (out of five) lug nuts. Each one was inspected and noticed no stripping of the threads. I was immediately told to wait in the waiting room for the company to look into the situation. After 40 minutes, I observed the owner and general manager, including a couple others walk by with their clipboards, went to inspect the action. Up to this point, no persons from the company came to me and apologized or tell me what was going on. No manager, no employee checked with me, the customer. I then hunted down the service writer and complained about the lack of information. About 1 hour later, the service manager came over and told me they inspected the actual vehicle and said all appeared okay. They did say that the rim was damaged and had to be replaced. My problem is I have to drive 140 miles to return for the replacement rim. The service writer did admit that his mechanic Jose admitted to not following procedure and failed to put on the lug nuts correctly. My problem is that I feel as if I was treated like I was a pain for their business rather than a customer who received terrible and dangerous service. I understand things happen, but they should have treated me with more respect and some concern. Not good way of doing business. By the way, I just inquired on the web and it appears they have an F rating with BBB.",1.0
"Please be careful with going only on external appearances and marketing techniques (I am not implying the first reviews made by auto magazines as they get only a first impression point of view). I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee (Limited) 2011 in July 2011 and was very impressed by it. I even went around promoting the product to my friends and family so much that even my brother in Australia bought a new one. Moreover, I was even planning for a Dodge Charger as my next car and I shall be opting for a Japanese vehicle instead. My best buddy too has almost booked a new Jeep GC 2012. Unfortunately, it has lived to its reputation of very poor reliability. 
      I have been experiencing software and GPS issues from day one. The pad of the parking brake came off in 5 months' time and the dealer in Dubai said it was not covered under the warranty clause and I had to pay for it. Luckily for me, the service consultant gave me such a shoddy service that the charges for the same was written off as a measure to compensate for the inconvenience caused to me (I do not want to give details of the same as it was addressed by the service manager). I took the vehicle on an Oman (a neighboring country of the UAE) trip (no off-roading and I have never used it for off-roading) around 6 months after buying the car and it wouldn't start after doing an uphill (again, on good tarred road). I had taken it to the dealer and they said everything is okay. Now the vehicle has developed some engine issues as the engine fault light (also called as MIL - Malfunction Indicator Light) comes on. I cannot understand how a new vehicle can have so many issues. I have been perfect with its service and have allowed only the authorized dealer to even touch it. The technicians cannot seem to find what the issue is with and had reset the computers so that the MIL goes off. Yesterday the light came back on. Worst of all is I am left without a vehicle for all these days and they refused to give a spare vehicle. I had also called Chrysler Middle East which promised to get back on the issue, but with no luck (they did not even call back). The car spent 3 days at the work shop and I guess it is only fair that I am given a replacement car. The warranty conditions in the US covers this factor wherein the dealer should arrange a replacement car (if the car develops issues during the warranty period and KM limit). This clause unfortunately has been conveniently removed for the Middle East. I even searched the net on the same and came across lots of negative feedback on Jeep GC (the new model) at American forums where they are more transparent. I really wish reliability issues were brought up so that other buyers are not caught off guard after shelling out so much money for a product that only looks good. I honestly regret for not having gone for a Pajero or a Japanese car. This is the first time I ventured for an American vehicle and I consider it the biggest follies of my life (by the way, I used to own a Mitsubishi Pajero which I sold to buy the Jeep).So much of American taxpayers' money has gone to revive the Chrysler Group and I think the people of America deserve more dedication from this group to upkeep the reputation and trust of the consumers towards American products (especially cars) in the international market. To all aspiring Jeep owners, my suggestion is to do a research on the net before buying this vehicle.",1.0
"I bought a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Greenway Chrysler Jeep in Orlando, with the dealer installed a trailer hitch. Salesman, manager and service department said it was identical to factory installed tow package. When I brought it back for installation, the paperwork specifically said that it was a factory tow package. Later, I found out that all they did was put a hitch on but did not do a transmission cooler or even program the computer to activate the trailer electrical connector, all of which increases towing capacity from 3,500lbs to 5,000lbs. I called Jeep customer service and they said they would look into it. Of course, Greenway Jeep did not take their calls. 
      After numerous attempts, the Jeep rep told me that Greenway said they were only supposed to install the hitch and not the full tow package even though I have a documented invoice that says it was to be a full tow package. The Jeep rep said they can do nothing since the dealership is independently owned. Bottom line is that Greenway Jeep lied to sell me the vehicle by saying that most tow packages on the lot are their installations, which is not true since they all had tow/haul buttons which the dealer does not put in. Second lie was that they would install the tow package on my vehicle, which they did not and didn't even bother to put in the computer code to enable the electrical connector. Greenway Jeep will say whatever it takes to sell the vehicle and the Jeep corporate helpline will not stand up for the customer. I have owned many Chrysler products, but I can assure you that I will never buy another one.",1.0
"I bought 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee in May 2012 and only had 16,000 miles on it. I notice that my gear slaps into gear with a shake or loud bang from going to drive to neutral. It's been at a Jeep dealership on and off for 2 months. They try to update the computer program and change out the body valve. It did not help it at all. I demand them to open my transmission and fix it or replace it for a new one. The manager said they will not allow that, but I have warranty on it. He said it doesn't matter. After all this time, I’m without my car that’s in the shop. They told me yesterday that it is a characteristic of the car to sound that loud and slam into gear that hard. I was upset because my $45,000 car sounds like a piece a junk. 
      They said the new car had that, but I don't notice it because it is new. Once you put some miles on it, the transmission will start developing the same thing. I feel they are misleading consumers and not telling them their transmission will have an explosive noise when your engine breaks through. We test other new vehicles and used vehicle just to see if the transmission was doing the same. Mine is harsher. I beg them to help, but they said that is all they can do. I made the manager go check the car before I leave and he noticed the transmission was hitting hard. He called in for another request because he knew it is not right, but he said Jeep probably rejected me. I don't know what to do. I don't understand why they promise consumer powertrain warranty for 5 years and 100,000 miles when they don't want to fix my transmission.",1.0

"My 2007 Grand Cherokee has been experiencing for probably almost a year from what I've seen on the internet as the ""death wobble"", a shared problem amongst a number of owners. Though the car has been in several times and had the drive shaft changed twice, the problem still exists. My last visit I was given back my keys and the rep said simply ""we can't find the problem"", and walked away without even giving me a chance to respond. Chrysler corporate then set up an appointment with another dealer (in another town) where I left the car and was then called at the end of the day stating they had no time to check it out and that I'd have to arrange to leave it another time. They should have at that point offered at least a loaner as I need my car for work. Simply put, I feel Chrysler simply does not care one iota for its customers. This is my 6th and last Chrysler product.",1.0
"2009 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland, purchased new. At 20,000 miles, the sunroof leaked in rain storm, parked on a very slight incline. The truck completely flooded. Water even came through the rear DVD screen mounted on the headliner. The dealer said, “Of course, sunroofs leak when parked on an incline(?).” The headliner had to be re-installed three times after that (four different trips to the dealership). At 24,000 miles, front brakes began to squeal at every stop. Chrysler refused to repair under warranty. Brakes continue to squeal at 55,000 miles. At 52,000 miles, the tires were completely worn out (after following strict rotation and routine pressure checks), replaced the tires, $800. At 54,000 miles, the rear tailgate lock actuator failed in the closed position, $400, not covered by warranty. 
      At 54,500 miles, the left passenger door lock actuator failed, $450, also, not covered. There's a rattle behind the dash at all speeds that the dealership cannot isolate, and despite meticulous maintenance practices and only buying gas from reputable sources, mileage has been worsening.

In 2006, I bought a new Grand Cherokee Overland (every option - $40k). It had a few quirks: window motor went out, wipers went bad, tires were bald, and radio/CD changer was shorting out - all before 40,000 miles! So, I thought, ""trade it in."" Stupid me, I traded it in for another one in 2010. This one ($48k) is a complete lemon. So far, the roof liner had to be replaced (fell on me at 70 mph!), the radio, again shorted out, the moon roof leaked and flooded the entire interior(!), the headliner came loose again, two remote locking servos failed - a week apart ($400 each, and not covered by warranty). And I again had to replace the tires (bald at 54k miles - $800). These trucks are designed by hacks and built by crack-smoking drunks (while they are at work, not off duty. Seen the videos?)

I had my foot on the break and it would not stop running me into the ice machine in front of the gas station! Luckily, no one was in front of me. If I would have hit a car or ran over a person/child, it would have been an utter tragedy! It was so scary. I had no control over this vehicle!

"Jeep cannot repair their own vehicles! I bought and paid $43,000 for a brand new 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Lebanon, OH Sweeney dealership. Driving it the very first week, the radio picked up increasing static and then lost all reception. I immediately contacted Cincinnati Northgate Jeep Chrysler dealership. I was told there was a ""cut"" in the wiring harness and they would order a new one. I waited and waited. Once wiring harness came in, I was told that it was not enough to fix it and they would also need a satellite antenna but they could not find a ""part number"" for it. It took the dealership over 3 weeks and several case workers to determine they could not find a part number nor get the satellite antennae. Chrysler has no idea when they can get the part in. We suggested removing one from the assembly line as Chrysler is proclaiming they are working extra shifts to keep up with demand. 
      Chrysler has no desire to fix their defective vehicle. They have our $43,000. Chrysler cannot or will not supply their dealerships with parts.

      My car will most likely be totaled since there is a lot of damage and it looks like the frame is crooked and can no longer shut the doors properly. Of course, Jeep will say that it was driver error, ""you must have hit the accelerator instead of the brake,"" but that is absolutely not the case.

The next day, it did the same thing and one of the passengers noticed that the RPMs went to over 4,500. On the way home, it did it again at a stop sign but only to 2,000 RPMs.
      One the way to my Jeep dealer to have it fixed it happened again. Two days and $650 later, they told it me was fixed. On the way home, it happened again. I brought it back and had one of their mechanics ride with me and we got the problem to happen yet again. It is now two days later and they have the car trying to fix a problem they deny happens.",2.0
"I purchased my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee in October of 2010.  It has now been in for repairs on the same problem 3 times.  The problem is with the push-start ignition.  Sometimes the key will not unlock the car.  Sometimes it isn't recognized by the car, which will not allow it to start.  Also, if someone is with me who also owns a jeep and has their keys on them, the computer goes haywire and starts beeping, reading ""key not recognized"" on the dash.  Now I am getting a thumping noise while driving.  The service department told me they fixed this, but to no avail.  It keeps happening.  The passenger side seat slides out of place around corners as well.",1.0
"I have a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee that had 142,000 miles on the engine. It failed in May 2010. I had a rebuilt one from Mopar that put in costing me over $5,000 with the labor. Now, 18 months later (20,000) I need another engine. After this experience I will never buy another Jeep product. I have to keep this one as I am into it for a lot of money. Be aware of their warranties that they try not to honor if it isn't taken or bought from a Jeep dealer. Still waiting for an engine. The car has been in the shop since December 14. They say that they have it as high priority and that they will find one for me. It’s still backordered until January 16 or 18. What a joke.",1.0
"The 2009 Jeep Patriot had a windshield wiper failure in rain storm. Chrysler recalled the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Commander vehicles in 2008 (08V059). The front control module may have been incorrectly manufactured. This could cause the engine to stall while driving or not to start and/or cause the windshield wipers to become inoperative. On November 11, 2010, Chrysler said Thursday it is recalling about 16,000 Jeep Liberty SUVs to fix faulty windshield wiper systems. Chrysler refuses to repair this problem with the Jeep Patriot.",1.0
"I truly believe that this Jeep Grand Cherokee will be the last American Car that I will ever buy. I purchased a new fully loaded 2003 Limited with a 4.7 liter HO and it has been nothing but trouble, very expensive trouble. The internet has made it possible to discover that I am not alone. Jeep must hate the internet.
      I've had too many horrible experiences with blown head gaskets, broken valve springs, midnight tow trucks, no heat, no air conditioning, dashboard removals and loud drive train noises. I thought that I bought a new car to avoid all of this trouble and expense. I guess the management at Chrysler Jeep believes that if you only want to spend a measly 36k on a car, you are being cheap and only get what you deserve. Well, in the last few years I purchased a new Toyota Lexus for my wife, a Honda Civic for my daughter in college and a Honda Crosstour for myself. It's become evident that the American car manufacturers have become the financial losers when they can't seem to engineer or stand behind a good dependable car that can make it past a hundred thousand miles.I am an aircraft mechanic with 37 years experience and have also worked on nothing but American cars for most of my life. I've pampered and garaged this Jeep to the point that it still looks just as good as it rolled out of the dealer's showroom. Looks are all that's left in this car because it all goes away once you turn the key and try to drive it. I've spent many thousands of dollars in repairs over the years and now have to just about give it away to get it out of the driveway and off my insurance. I will miss getting a Christmas card every year from my local towing service.You can delete or throw this letter in the trash if you want. I'm just one person reporting on my experiences with this awful car. There is no way that I could ever recommend a Jeep to a friend or family member. This was my third and absolute last new Jeep anything. I always liked the way they look, but I can not see it getting any better so it's bye, bye to the American Car for me.",1.0
"My 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee accelerated on me twice. Once when I was at a drive up ATM, the engine started revving like crazy while I had my foot on the brake. The tires were screeching and it sounded like I was clearly trying to drive with my foot on the brake. I was terrified. It happened one other time as well when I was stopped, but the car was on. From then on, I was beyond paranoid that it could happen again, and what if I wouldn't be able to stop it? What if the brake didn't work? Very scary. Clearly, there’s an issue with these cars and this should be taken seriously because this isn't a joke.",1.0
"I purchased a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo on March 26, 2007 at Tamiami Chrysler Jeep Agency (8250 SW 8th Street, Miami, FL 33144). Color: khaki.
      A few weeks ago, I realized that the driver door inside the opener was broken. Consequently, I visited the Planet Chrysler Dodge Jeep Agency (9975 NW 12th Street, Miami, FL 33172) for the replacement. The price of this little part that includes its panel is unbelievable: $719.00. I am a Jeep lover, but this price is too high as well as the occurrences of this broken part in many Jeeps of this model: Grand Cherokee Laredo. I need to open the driver door from the outside door opener, all the time.",3.0

"My family has owned and operated automatic car washes for nearly 50 years. Over the past 10 years , we have had half a dozen incidents with Jeep Grand Cherokee's accelerating out of control. Every time it has happened, our employees have maintained that the vehicle took off on them and they could not stop it. The first few times it happened, we assumed it was driver error but not anymore. There is case after case of this happening and nobody at Chrysler will do anything about it. 
      On Friday Nov 25th 2011, we had a Jeep Grand Cherokee come into one of our full service locations and when my drive off guy, a 25 year veteran, started it up and put it into gear, it took off on him rapidly accelerating. He narrowly missed other employees and customers and plowed into a utility pole. He has cuts and bruises from the air bag and is in a lot of pain but he maintains that he had his foot on the brake and not the gas. This employee's only job is to pull cars off of the conveyor and as I said, he is a 25-year veteran guy. We will only push jeep Grand Cherokees off the conveyor. We will not start them.",1.0
"On Wednesday November 23, 2011, I was pulling into a parking stall in a shopping mall in my Jeep Grand Cherokee 2005. My engine started revving as I applied my brakes to stop in the parking spot. I slammed on the brakes even harder and my Jeep catapulted through a store front window. Thank God no one was hurt. I am extremely lucky that a 9 month Pregnant Mum and her toddler were just out of the way when this happened. It would have been a catastrophe if I had hit them, or had left the mall and had this happen in rush hour traffic!",5.0
"On July 2, 2011, I was backing my son’s 2006 (limited) Jeep Grand Cherokee (HEMI) into our driveway.  We have a wide and long driveway, so we park our vehicles beside each other.  His friend parked it on the street, so I went to move it at 10:15 pm into the driveway.  All I did was start it up, and I had my foot on the brake.  Then, I pulled it forward a bit past our driveway so I could back it in.  I never had to take my foot off the brake.  I then put the Jeep in reverse and that's when it just peeled out going backwards.  I couldn't believe what was happening.  
      So, I kept trying to stop the Jeep but there was no stopping it.  I was practically standing on the brake but nothing helped.  I ended up backing into my parked vehicle.  My vehicle was hit so hard that it backed into my husband’s vehicle.  Then, I backed into a 6 ft. stockade fence, knocking 3 sections down, then into my neighbor’s parked car when the jeep finally came to a stop.",5.0

"My daughter has a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, fully loaded and has loved every minute up until August of this year. The car won't start. The dealer in Springfield,VA put in a new win module, and a week later she was towing it to another Chrysler dealer in Burlington, North Carolina, where she goes to college. It has now been to the dealers 6 times - anywhere from a week-10 days at a stretch. It definitely is an anti-theft issue and the computer needs to be reset. I've even had the two truck people tell me and the dealership, what the problem is. A day or two later, the car starts, then a day or two later it doesn't. It would seem like two Chrysler dealerships, and 2 1/2 months later, someone could figure this out.
      I've had to get my daughter another car, and am still waiting to see if they care enough to fix it so I can sell it. The world's a better place because I'm not the kind of person that will try to sell it unless it's fixed, but at this point, I'm not so sure that's likely to happen. Blue book on this vehicle is about $15,000 and I should just take it to the junk yard? Way to go Chrysler!",1.0
"We have a new 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland with the newly designed Pentastar V6 engine. The vehicle was rated with the tow package to haul 5000lbs. Pulling a much lighter 3100lbs trailer up I-70, the vehicle overheated and cut the RPM down to 3000. We were then forced to crawl at 20 miles per hour. We took the vehicle into 3 dealerships under the warranty and after a lot of wasted time, we actually had one dealership drive the vehicle and trailer with monitoring equipment attached. The equipment captured the problem 4 different times. 
      Later, when Chrysler was involved and was supposed to analyze the data, we were told that all of the data disappeared. We then had to deliver the vehicle and trailer to the dealership where the regional Chrysler rep tried to say the problem was the frontal wind load surface area was greater than their maximum of 40 square feet, until we pointed out that the area is a simple measurement using a tape measure (width times height) and our trailer measured about 32 square feet of frontal wind load surface. The dealership was not able to show us the communications between Chrysler and them, citing that it was privileged. The dealership confirmed and Chrysler agreed that the vehicle was operating within the design specifications, but definitely not according to the advertised and sales specs. The dealership said there was nothing they could do to fix the problem and Chrysler was not proposing a solution. There is a case open with Chrysler, which does not appear to be getting much attention since not many people are able to get through the dealerships to actually talk to Chrysler about this severe design problem. It appears that after Chrysler has taken government bailout money which we paid for, they are not about to spend anything on correcting their problems unless many, many people complain about it or stop buying their vehicles.",1.0

"I bought a certified pre-owned 2007 Jeep grand Cherokee about a year ago and it has already been back to the dealership over a dozen time. I have owned a '98 Grand Cherokee, a '02 Grand Cherokee, my now '07 Grand Cherokee, and have test drove a '11 Grand Cherokee, and by far my '07 and the '11 Grand Cherokees are the worst, most pointless pieces of scrap metal that I have ever dealt with. Every point of design, thought, and development of any Jeep from at least 2005 was done by a kindergarten child with a crayon and the care of when nap time was.
      I own my '02 Grand Cherokee for 2 years and was heart broken when I traded it in because of mechanical engine issues. I thought buying a '07 would save me from stupid pointless ""age"" issues, but apparently the only thing my '07 did for me was save me from ""age"" issues but not from stupid, pointless, immature problems. Everything that went wrong with my '02 was mechanical and I was proud to pay for the repairs and maintenance, but everything that has gone wrong with my '07 is electrical, which I consider childish, lack of caring, and the thought that ""as long as the engine works, who cares about the brake lights"".Within the first 1000 miles of owning my '07 grand Cherokee, she was back in the dealership for new front window controls, because the passenger side front automatic windows weren't working. From then on, my '07 has spent more time at the dealership getting ""fixed"" than any of my other cars have spent together getting repaired and dealing with basic maintenance combined. Other than my front passenger window, the only other thing that has gone wrong is my tire pressure monitoring system. The low pressure light turns on whenever it wants to, and I mean whenever it wants to. The light will turn when I'm going 75 mph down the highway, 25 mph through the city, and even when the engine is off and parked in a parking garage or my driveway.Baystate Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram in Newton is where I bought my car and who have been doing all the ""repairs"" on my '07 grand Cherokee. Between the 12 times my car has gone in for ""repairs"", they have replaced all 4 tire pressure sensors twice, replaced the WIN module (receiver for the tire pressure system), reset the car's computer twice, and had to take out the aftermarket car alarm after it was going off uncontrollably after the dealership reset my car's computer the first time. After all of this, the light is still coming on.",1.0
"I own a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee and have had nothing but major problems from the electrical system since 2007. At the time, I was almost killed driving the vehicle to the point where I took it to the local dealer (which I had been in and out already) and parked it, and told them I would not drive it any longer until they figured out what the problem was. Finally, they convinced me that they needed to replace the whole computer system in the Jeep and that would take care of the problems. 
      I agreed, shelled out thousands of dollars to do it (a consumer should never need to replace those parts on a vehicle) anyway and I paid for it. I have driven the Jeep since, until today and what should happen? The gremlins have returned. Lights, gauges, radio, wipers, turn signals, the works --all on the blink. I have it now with a local mechanic to check out. If no luck, I will take it to the local dealer and heaven help the Chrysler Corporation if I do not get this vehicle back on track. If they stand behind their product, there should be no reason they can not either fix it or replace the computer again on their dime.",1.0

On the 3rd time, my air conditioning unit failed and, most annoyingly, my remote keypads only worked correctly maybe once a day.

"I bought a used 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo in 2005. It had 42k miles on it and has 81k miles on it now. We primarily use it as a back-up vehicle and have purposely not driven it to keep miles low for resale value. Since I have owned it, I have had to replace all four Rotors (few hundred dollars), the transmission (2.5k dollars), the bearings in the back-end shattered (I never even took it off road), leaked grease all over the e-brake so they had to tear the entire back-end out and replace it (1.6k dollars) and last week on a drive, the fan relay went out causing the radiator to get too hot which resulted in a blown head gasket, cracked head, broken water pump, and somehow it seems to have shorted out the radio. The latest mechanic quoted me at another 2,500.00 to get it all fixed. I am spending much more on repairs than the thing is worth, and we haven't even put 40k miles on it yet. What a piece of garbage. I was excited for a Jeep but I will never own one again. It's a nightmare.",1.0
"I purchased a 2011 Grand Cherokee in July, 2011.  A few weeks later the idiot lights and wipers went wild while I was driving. Dealership said it could be the key fob. They replaced it. Three weeks later, the key fob failed to unlock and ignite the car. I was forced to use emergency key. They said to bring it in. 
      I used the spare key fob in the meantime. It failed to open the car and the key refused to turn in the ignition. The car was honking and lights flashing as before. Had to have it towed. The tow driver said the car turned itself on while on the tow dolly twice. He had to stop and turn it off! Dealership doesn't know what's wrong. The car has 1,800 miles on it.

I asked to speak with a manager and she said sure, but you're still not getting reimbursed.  My father retired from Chrysler and I love Jeeps but because they refused to reimburse me this small amount (to them), this is the third and last Jeep (or Chrysler product) I will purchase unless they change their minds.

"My 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee had water leaking inside from the hand rails, center upper console, and back windows after it rains.  I took it to the Kentucky dealership that I bought it from, and the problem was fixed, under warranty (so they said).  I moved to Florida, and the issue was still there.  This time it was not under warranty. So, I had to pay out of pocket, even though this issue occurred while under warranty, and had been ""fixed"".  Now I am taking it back to the dealership in Stuart, Florida.  I took pictures of how bad it was leaking.  I asked the dealership how payment would be handled, since I have already paid them before to fix this.  They said, if needed  I can call customer service for help.  I called customer service, and that was a complete joke.  They asked what I wanted them to do.",1.0

I am very pleased in owning this Jeep; but around the last few years, the rear bushings broke down. It still runs great but it would cost me $2500 to fix it; and I don't have that much money to fix it. 
      Around last year, the air conditioning stopped working on the right side; and I think it was the EGR system monitor. I'm not very sure but I think that's what's wrong. But after 140150 miles on it, I'm sure there are things which will go wrong with it.

"I want to tell you about a very scary incident that happened to me today. I have a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I have been driving the car for a few months. I drove to a friend's house to drop off an item. I parked the car on the side of the street, put the car in park and ran up the stairs to drop off the item without turning off the car. Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw the Jeep rolling backwards down a side street at a high acceleration. I ran as fast as I could to try to get into the car and stop it.
      I could not catch up with the car. Finally the car stopped after hitting a parked car. I am so glad no children were near this incident or they would have been crushed under the car. A police report was made and I went home and did a lot of research and found that there are many complaints about this issue. I also went in my alley and tried to repeat the incident while staying in the car. I found that the gear can get stuck between reverse and park. I have a 16 year old daughter who also drives this car and I am very concerned. Please let me know what I can do now to repair this very critical issue with my Jeep Grand Cherokee.",
"I own a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The window regulator behind the driver broke. To replace it, I had to pay $102.90 for the regulator alone. I had my husband and father install it. It worked for a day and then broke. We took the regulator that was just purchased to the auto parts store where it was purchased and they said it had to be replaced for an additional $102.90.

"I bought a new 2011 jeep Grand Cherokee x package on Jan. 18, 2011. Two weeks after I bought the jeep, I was stopped at a light and the car accelerated forward nearly hitting the car in front of me. Electronic throttle light and engine light came on. I brought it to the dealer, they told me they had no answer and they had to wait for Chrysler to call them and tell them what to do as they had no clue. 
      A couple of days in the shop they told me they repaired it as it was a bad sensor on the gas pedal. A week later same thing happened, only this time I was stopped at a stop sign waiting to make a right turn, it was snowing and the car surged ahead right into the intersection causing the car to skid out onto the sidewalk almost hitting the pole.So far no damage to anything as to my quick thinking. I bought this car as a first car for my 17-year-old daughter but I will never put her in this car.  She is a new driver and I don't think this car is worth her life or anyone else's. Someone needs to investigate this deathtrap of a car. This is very unfair for Chrysler to sit back and let people unknowingly get behind the wheel of a deadly automobile. What does insurance companies think of this, as they will have to pay out millions for the damage that this will incur.",

I am trying to find out what I can do about my 1997 jeep grand Cherokee that has just started having stall problems. I understand that there was a recall a while ago from Chrysler for this problem.

And I still have a broken bridge in my nose that will require surgery as soon as we reach a settlement with Travelers Ins.

"My complaint comes only after reading consumer reports from people who experienced the same thing that I am experiencing. My 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee stalls and has acceleration problems. After researching this, I find that it is a problem Chrysler is aware of. Complaint after complaint states that people are afraid to drive their vehicle. 
      My car came to a stop in an intersection with people blowing their horns at me to ""step on the gas"". Funny thing was that I was stepping on the gas. The car jolts into gear when shifting into drive and fails to accelerate. The problem is the Shift Module which the dealer, where I expressed my concert to, was aware of, and they said that they had replaced many of them at a cost of more than $1,000, which is what I will be charged because my warranty ran out 6,000 miles ago. I don't want to drive it whether it gets fixed or not, and I am afraid to trade it in as I feel I may be responsible for someone else's death sentence.

"I purchased a new 2006 Jeep Commander Limited fully loaded in October of 2005. The vehicle was a necessity due to the fully loaded Grand Cherokee I purchased like 3-4 years prior that was giving me nothing but trouble from day one. I did chalk it up to. Maybe I just got a bad car. It happens. So I get my new vehicle and start to not like it; the more I drove it, gas mileage, massive blind spots, and other than that there are not too many problems.We received a 3-year/36000 mile warranty and purchased a 100,000 mile warranty as well. 
      This warranty should have taken me to 136,000 miles, which it does not. You actually get 64,000 extra miles of coverage for the price of a 100,000. Not arguing. I’m not happy, but what do you do with all the computer technology in these cars? You have to get it or pay huge repair costs. I have had my truck 4 years. 2 years ago before warranty expired, I had to take it in to have a new climate control device installed. I get my truck back and they have to take apart almost the entire dash to do this; mind you, my vents for heat and air don't stay in like they did when it was new. It’s very lose now but I just shrugged this off figuring it just didn't have the same seal left since they had to do work to it.About a month after in December of 2008, I'm now out of warranty and my radio starts blinking in and out not often so I hope it's just a glitch and nothing serious. I have no coverage. Then about 2 months past this during the day, if I have to turn on my headlights (take the lever off of auto), my headlights started blinking on and off. It doesn't do this if you allow the lights with the switch in the auto position to come on by themselves via the sensor. Again, terrified of the possible repair costs, it stops doing this. Last week my radio starts blinking in and out, but now it’s staying out more then in when this happens. I'm totally stuck with whatever channel/mode the radio is in. I can't use my navigation system, nothing. So on 09/21/2010 my son and I take it apart thinking due to the way it's acting its a lose wire; well, its not. We called a family friend who works on car stereo's; he calls me to inform me that it's something wrong with the actual radio, something inside of the head unit is lose and to his knowledge there is no reason why this should even remotely have happened. He tells me to contact the dealer and see if there has been a recall on the radio; of course, there hasn't. I tell the gentlemen in the parts department of everything; I just wrote my concerns and he looks up my information and says, “I'm sorry.” Short of doing a radio exchange at a cost of $957.00 (not including labor). My car, which is now 4 years old and has 155000 plus or minus mileage—there's nothing they can do to help me. But I should contact Chrysler directly and see if they can help. So I call them at 1-800-992-1997 where I am told the same thing basically. It's too far out of warranty; they won’t help me. I can purchase a new radio or deal with what I have. I explained I could understand something being shaken lose if I used my vehicle for off road excursions but I don't. I never have. But to no avail, I was still told sorry.I now have to pull over. Every time a movie is playing in the back, it needs to be restarted; hence, I can no longer do it from the actual radio. The lights still occasionally blink on and off, so people think I'm flashing them to tell them there is a cop around. I'm eventually gonna get an inspection ticket for this and not be able to afford to have it fixed because reading the reports online, Jeep has no idea how to fix anything in their products unless like me they are out of warranty and then it's a million dollars to walk in the door.",
"My 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee stalls unexpectedly at any speed. It has been to two auto shops and so far we have spent 900.00 on repairs. Jeep does not acknowledge the problem even though is is heavily reported on by consumer. Apparently, it is not a problem exclusive to old Jeeps. If you Google Jeep stalling, you will see thousands and thousands of complaints.",
"I recently purchased a brand new Grand Cherokee from Snethkamp. I put a good down payment and was very excited to get my new vehicle, which was not to give me any problems. Ever since I took the car off the lot, I have experienced and encountered problems that someone should not when buying a brand new truck. Within the first 2 weeks, a noise, more so a rattling sound from the engine started. I took it into services and that’s when it stayed overnight, only for them to tell me nothing was found and the truck should be fine. 
      Within 2 weeks, it was back in for the same sound, only this time they heard the sound, but were unable to tell me what the exact reason was. Also, apart from the noise my rim had popped off the front tire, a wire/sensor for the temperature was hanging out the front grill, and my air conditioning unit stopped working. It has been in the ""shop"" since 8/24/10 and the mechanics are still unable to tell me what the problem is. I spoke to the worker who told me they had ordered an additional part for the ac unit and once they replaced it, it still did not work and the same issue continued.Now being over a week in the ""shop"", he tells me they basically have to remove the dashboard and ""re-install"" the parts. I don’t understand why I have to go through this when I purchased the vehicle brand new. I am extremely upset and unsatisfied with the way things are going. Chrysler is already not in the best spot, and I don’t believe they need customers complaining of new vehicles purchased. I mean, this is a brand new car, why is this happening? I have been late to work and school. It has caused me major stress due to having such horrible experience with a new truck. I have also encountered an anxiety attack once the rim had popped off making a noise while I was driving.",
"I just purchased my used 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee and and the cruise control would work sometimes and then not work other times. And the engine light would go off and go on. I took it in and they said they would order the new cruise control module for me. I then took it home and the next day I was driving it down the highway at 55 mph. I came behind a lady driving 40 mph when I started around her to pass. Just as I started to pass her, I noticed another car coming at me that was definitely speeding.
      I pushed down the accelerator pedal and the car stalled and kept losing power. Nothing I did made it go and in fact it kept losing power. I was stuck in the passing lane with a car coming at me. I froze and thank God both cars slowed and I was able to get around. Now I am frightened of this car and keep having bad nightmares about what has happened to me. I called the dealership and spoke to them about what had happened to me and they said they don't know what I could be talking about or why it happened. I am now doing research on this problem and am now reading about a lot of stalling problems. This car is now frightening to me. ( I was on my way to pick up my granddaughter. I cannot imagine even letting her ride in it now. (I was almost killed. ) I am going to show the dealership these articles about the stalling problem with this vehicle. I keep having bad dreams about what almost happened to me.",
"At 9:30 pm, I went out to move my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It fully accelerated when I put it into dive, it shot me across the street toward the center of my neighbor's house. I managed to steer to the left into a row of 8 oak trees, hitting one and totaling the Jeep. That was the second time in two months that the vehicle had fully accelerated, with me standing on the brakes, unable to stop it.",
"I am an owner of a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. At 120000 miles, two brackets on my drivers seat broke, leaving it wobbly. A little while later, the other 2 brackets broke, leaving the seat completely free and hanging by nothing but the power cord since they are powered seats. We then attempted to have someone weld the seat back to the brackets. Upon leaving, the right side broke and the left side still intact as of now. 
      Upon researching the internet, I have found many complaints regarding the same situation. and I'm not talking like 10 or 20, more like 100 or more. The most recently just posted is this past July 2010. Some stated that upon contacting Chrysler, they said that they weren't going to do nothing for them and go to one of their dealerships which is to fix the problem would cost $800 to $1000 dollars. Me, a mom of 2, the youngest just 9 weeks old, can't afford such a fix. So in order for me to drive my jeep around, I have to bungee cord my seat to the floor. This is such a hazard to the drivers of these vehicles. When is Chrysler going to take responsibility for this? It's only matter of time before someone is in an accident and thrown threw the windshield because of these faulty seat brackets.",
"I recently purchased a '98 Jeep Grand Cherokee XJ model. What a mistake. Apparently, it is cursed with various intermittent electrical problems, i.e. the door locks inadvertently engage/disengage, then stop for awhile, then start again. Also, the courtesy lights will blink on/off at the same time the door lock thing is happening. Pulling the fuse that supposedly protects the door lock circuit doesn't stop the problem. I've had to pull a relay to stop the courtesy lights. Also, the engine now stalls every morning on my way to work at about 50 to 60 mph. 
      I pull over, shut it off for about 30 seconds, then it starts right up again. The check engine light comes on for a while, but then goes away. I had a friend check the diagnostic codes, and they indicate a fault with the TPS sensor or ignition coil. All the maintenance is up to date, and it otherwise runs well, so I don't want to just start changing parts. I've read all the Jeep forums, and these are all very common problems across the board. It's funny that the few recalls regarding the electrical problems don't apply to my model. It seems that Chrysler uses inferior control modules which are tied together by data bus cables. A fault in any one system can infect another, so forget about diagnosing and fixing anything right the first time. Maybe we could get one of the Chrysler design engineers to explain this to us.",
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 30,140 miles in January 2010. Within a month I noticed one time when I went to accelerate that it would not take off normally for about 3-5 seconds and then would slowly begin to accelerate and run normal. I assumed at the time that I had my foot incorrectly positioned on the accelerator. It happened about 4-5 more times in 4 months since then, but it always corrected itself after I moved my foot while pumping from panic of someone hitting me because I'm not able to accelerate as expected. Well, today, even though it does not have a warranty, has less then 39,000 miles, and I can't afford to put it in the shop, I have no choice. I could have died today. 
      This time I went to pull out of my parking lot and it accelerated fine until it got to 30 mph, and then it would not accelerate any further! The speed limit on that stretch of road is 55 mph. The truck behind me almost ran into the back of me. He had to swerve into the oncoming lane to avoid hitting me. Luckily, there was not a car in the opposing lane at the time. I immediately got ticked off and went online as soon as I could get back to my desk to find out what could cause this and I found many, many postings of people with the same problem and also found out that Chrysler (Jeep) is very aware of the problem and still has not initiated a recall!I believe it has something to do with the shifter module which costs over $1000 to replace. That's $990 more than I have right now. But I'll have to figure something out because paying for that (which should be recalled) is better than my daughter who is being raised by me, a single mother, losing her mother in an accident that can be prevented if Chrysler would take responsibility for using faulty parts and cover the replacement before they get a class action suit against them. I know I'll be the first in line.",
"I own a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee with a recurring problem. In June 2005, the relay that runs the engine cooling fan had to be replaced, the car had 45,168 miles on it. This happened again in October 2006, with 67,093, again in August 2007 with 80,042, and again in March 2010 with 115,030. Was there a recall on this part? Should there be? The cost were, $306.06, $404.65, $484.40. There is also the inconvenience of getting stuck on the side of the road and not having transportation while the vehicle is being repaired. I am not in the position to buy a new vehicle nor can I sell this one knowing of this problem. I also can't afford the extra repair costs.",
I ran into the back of a truck after it slam on its brake about 50-55 mph and my air bag didn't go off. So you should look into that because I hit so hard that my frame bent. I am ok but you really so look in to the air bag in the 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.,
"Back in 2007, I bought a used 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. I totally fell in love with it. Well, I noticed during the test drive it had no heat nor air so the deal was to have that fixed and we would buy it. So that got fixed and 4 months later in 1/08 the heat stopped, found out that the blender doors tend to do this on this model. So it sat all winter long since we did not have $1,200 to fix it. In March of 2008, we got it fixed. In January of 2009, it happened again. Once again, we waited until we had the money to fix it. This time we did not fix it until February 2010. Now it is May of 2010 and it happened again, I was driving yesterday and my air turned off. 
      I called Chrysler and filed a complaint, and today, they called back and said my case was denied due to the mileage of the SUV, which is 112,000, was too high and I am the third owner and that it is not a safety hazard. I am so mad right now. First off, it is a safety hazard when the windows frost up and I cannot see driving down the road because I have no defrost. Secondly, who cares if I am the 3rd owner? Anyway, they are not done dealing with me.",
"The 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee had unintended acceleration when moving from park to drive on three occasions with the most recent resulting in a serious accident. Even after the car came to a stop against a tree, the car was still revving. This was witnessed by a bystander.",
"I have a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, which I recently bought from a Jeep certified dealer. The problem is that while driving down the interstate at around 55mph or higher, my Jeep will automatically shut off for no apparent reason. This has happened to me at least 7 or 8 times since I've had it. A few of the times, I had to hurry and coast onto the shoulder of the highway and the other time, I was luckily able to put the vehicle in neutral and restart it before getting rear-ended. I took it to the Jeep dealer, but they said this particular model/year has not been recalled yet so they don't know what to fix on it and until it's recalled, it won't be covered under my warranty. 
      I called Jeep to make an official complaint because I want it corrected and want Jeep to pay for it. I also called the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Admin.), it was a simple 5-minute call. The guy I spoke to, as well as myself, urge everyone with this problem I am explaining to call and report it to 1-888-327-4236. The guy was nice and made up a report. He said he only had 7 people call about this problem. He said some people are either scared to call or don't know how to call to report it. But he said the more callers they get, the more evidence they have to pursue Jeep and take legal action against them. It's worth 5 minutes of everyone's time to get as many callers to report this problem so they are forced to recall this model/year. After all, what's 5 minutes of your time? It could end up being your life or someone else's.",
"I purchased a new 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee ltd 6-cylinder on 4/3/10 from a Jeep dealer. After driving it, I noticed that when I stop at a light or stop sign and the car is on an incline of any steepness, the car rolls backwards dramatically. Enough so that I almost hit a car behind me on two separate occasions. I quickly take my foot off the brake and accelerate as quickly as possible but it doesn't matter as the car is already in a fast roll back. It is so unsafe that I cannot even drive my car. I contacted the dealer twice. They called the manufacturer and they said that's the way it is and they have never had any such complaints. 
      I find that hard to believe, especially in so far as the service manager at the dealership told me my car is probably equipped with ""hill assist"" and it is probably turned off. We checked that and there is no ""hill assist"". Strange though that if jeep is to be believed about never having heard any such complaints, then why do they put ""hill assist"" on its cars. I contacted the manufacturer customer service and they made a ""report"" but said there is nothing to be done as it doesn't qualify for ""lemon law"". I am quite upset that after spending $40,000 on a car, it is unsafe when on an incline. I advised them that I almost had an accident twice due to this and what happens when another family member drives the car and may be in similar situations and they also have an accident and do physical damage to both my car and the car behind, and even worse cause physical injury and get sued. Jeep wants no part of my complaint. I am at my wit's end with what I can do. The dealer told me there is nothing that they can do and cannot even install hill assist as it comes directly from the factory only.",
"Our 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee was broken into Dec 17, 2009; at which time the dash was compromised and all the GPS/navigation/satellite and radio electronics were stolen ($3,800 to replace). A police report was filed, and insurance claim opened. The electronics has been received at the dealership; but to date the dash has not been received. 
      We have been promised first a date in Jan, then Feb, then Mar, and now April no promise date for delivery has been given. We have had to make all phone calls and response to our requests have not been very prompt. This is a $40,000 very low mileage car and the family has been severely impacted on waiting for 4 months for a dash to be delivered. The dealer and Chrysler customer service have not given us any confidence of when we will get our vehicle back. We are current on its registration and insurance, but loss of use has exceeded normal conditions. My spouse works 94 miles round trip from home to work and severely impacts family daily living use.",
"My husband and I have two Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredos, a 2001 and 2002 model. Three window regulators on the 2002 and two on the 2001 models have had to be replaced. At $500.00 a pop, we have spent over $2,000.00 replacing the window regulators. We love the vehicles otherwise but this is truly pathetic that as a consumer, we must pay top dollar for these vehicles and be milked to death because of a cheap plastic part. Can anything be done to recompense the owners of these vehicles?",
"I had a problem with my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee transmission, it was leaking. When I took it to the dealer, they said it would cost around 500.00 to fix. This car only had 11000 miles on it at the time. So I took it to a transmission place in our town and got it fixed for around 200.00. I was also told that this is an ongoing problem with Jeep Grand Cherokee, and that they have had quite a few brought in for the same problem. My question is if Jeep knows about the problem, why wasn't there a recall on for this problem instead of having buyer pay the expense of repair. It took money away from my family and I was without a car for several days.",
"While driving home the evening of 3/8/10 on a pitch dark country road by Madras, OR, my 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, without warning, shut down all dash and head lights. My two year old was in the back seat. I slammed the breaks not wanting to travel straight on a corner turn. After skidding to a complete stop, I applied the high beams for a last ditch effort and the lights came back on. Thankfully, I did not go off the road.",
"Please look at the link. It details ongoing electrical problems with Jeeps, the link is primarily for 2005 Grand Cherokees but the problem affects many others. I am waiting for further update on mine as it is in the shop. It was a total shut down of the vehicle, a potential crash due to loss of power while driving or stranding drivers. There seems to be no one at Jeep/Chrysler that is taking this seriously. A recall needs to be implemented.",
"This took place several years ago. 1995 to be exact. My wife and I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4WD. About three months after purchasing the vehicle, we took it in for a problem. We described it to the dealership order writer that the car would not go into gear after stopping at a red light or stop sign and it would take few seconds before it would go into gear and only after a sudden jerk. At that time, it was under warranty and it was taken care of. Four months later, it did it again. This time, my wife was in the middle of an intersection making a left turn and when she needed it to go, the jeep would not go. At this time, all vehicles from her left had a green light and started to approach closer at high speeds and finally, the jeep went into gear after a strong jerk. By then she was shook up as cars were all honking not knowing the situation.
      The dealer again fixed it under warranty. At 16,000 or so miles, the jeep did it again. This time, I was informed that I need a whole transmission overhaul and the warranty was not going to pay for it this time. I talked to the service manager who asked me to talk to Chrysler reps and Zone supervisor. After informing them it has been an ongoing problem, a meeting was set. 3 days later, I was the only person sitting there with the service manager of the dealer. We waited over 2 hours and they never showed up or called. I left with nothing to go on, except that he would call me with another appointment as soon as he could get in contact with them. I told the service manager to go ahead and fix the jeep and hoping that they would end up paying for the $1800.00 bill. He said they should. Well, yes you got it! They never set any appointment or wanted to discuss the problem. The service manager and manager of the dealer would not speak to me. Yes, I had the transmission done three other times for exactly the same problem. 6 times total. Funny thing, I knew of the problem from other jeep owners who had scary and danger stories like my wife's and reported them, but never did the government step up. Then came other factor, all along I paid between $1900.00 to $2100.00 on repairs until I met this local mechanic who told me they all had taken me for a fool, that all the dealer was doing was replacing a faulty switch that controls the shifting. Price for the repairs with my new mechanic $80.00. Yes, he still works on my cars to this date. I wrote this because with the Toyota deal, I somehow stumbled into this site about Jeeps. I can not believe Jeep never had and probably never will have any integrity on their products.",
"My grievance is twofold.  The first part is, unfortunately, fairly common with many people experiencing the same thing as I have.  The second part, however, I hope you will find as unbelievable as I do.
      PART 1: I own a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, bought brand new from Hoover Chrysler Jeep of Savannah.  At 20,000 miles, I started having intermittent problems while I was driving, with dash lights coming on randomly--sometimes not going off and the transmission acting funny, rumbling and not accelerating.  The dealership would reset the dash lights without explanation.As time went on, the intermittent problems became more pronounced.  All of the dash lights come on and go off immediately--sometimes, one or two stay on, most frequently the ASP and tire traction lights.  These lights usually go out with the rest of the dash lights on the next occurrence of them flashing on and off.  Now, at the same time, the dash lights flash off.  My jeep completely loses power, the headlights, radio, and a/c turn off and the engine stalls.  A second later, the dash lights up again as the engine restarts itself.  On separate occasions, my jeep has refused to accelerate, no matter how hard I pressed on the gas pedal.These problems are very random, always occurring while I am driving anywhere from 15 miles per hour to 55mph--occurring most frequently on the highway.  The frequency has increased but is still very inconsistent, although it has never happened while driving for the first time that day.  It's usually on my way home from work or errands after work.  And it almost always happens more than once in a row.The dealership acknowledged the problem and replaced my PCM but the problem reoccurred as soon as I left.  Since then, the dealership has told me that there are no codes in my computer and they cannot recreate the problem.  Therefore, they cannot fix it.  This was the response after they had my jeep for 27 days.  No further action was suggested.  I called Chrysler directly and they recommended I get a second opinion, which I will certainly do.  After the way my jeep was returned to me, I don't plan on ever using Hoover Chrysler again. PART 2: When I picked up my vehicle, I was irritated because I dropped it off on full and it was returned to me on empty with the tire pressure light on, grease prints everywhere and it smelled horrible!  Imagine my irritation at finding that the cause of the horrible odor was that someone had been smoking in it.  There were cigarette ashes everywhere and a cigarette wrapper on the driver's side floorboard.  My car had previously never been smoked in.As if that wasn't bad enough, the next day, I opened the backdoor and found that they had left a dirty baby diaper on the floorboard.  I called the service manager who indicated that he was driving my jeep but doesn't smoke and that he needed to find out who else had been driving it.  The mechanic I spoke to when picking it up had previously indicated to me that he had been the one driving it.When the service manager called me back, he stated that no one admitted fault but the man responsible for detailing vehicles and delivering parts had driven my jeep and offered to detail it for me.  Why was the car washer/parts deliverer driving my jeep?  How do they not know who all was driving it?  Does the dealer's policy allow smoking and transporting your family around in customers' vehicles?  Even better, does the dealer's insurance cover this?They next day, they picked my jeep up to detail it and returned it--they had cleaned the outside and put air freshener in the a/c vents but didn't even touch the inside!  It still reeks of stale smoke and the ashes are still everywhere.  I guess I shouldn't have assumed that my complaints of cigarette ashes and odor were enough to indicate I wanted the inside cleaned.The service manager had me bring my jeep back again today but I am sure that the service will be as substandard as it has been in every other instance.  The time and gas this is costing me--not to mention the miles I can't afford to put on my malfunctioning vehicle is outrageous.  All topped off by the fact that they can't even fix my jeep.",
"I have had a '00 Grand Cherokee for about 3 years now, I have talked to some other owners, the Clock springs seem to be notorious for going bad in these Jeeps (in the steering wheel for the airbag). Not only is this an issue but I am having issues with the taillights, I keep having to replace the socket(s) for the brake/running light. These sockets coming new from the dealership keep burning out about every 2 months. The brake light will not work when the lights are on. Pending what side is burnt. They only cost $8 each, but after you do this so many times it starts to add up. Nobody can give me a straight answer on what might do it without a $75 an hour inspection.",
"We have a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It has 130,000 miles. In the past 2 months, we have had problems of the car stalling, when we idle at a light or stop sign, intermittently. There are times where we start to accelerate, either at the start of a drive or after waiting for a light to change, and the engine will not respond. It stutters. There are times it will restart immediately and others were there will be a couple of tries. There are times when it does have a smell of gas. Just today as I was idling and letting out a passenger, they had commented that it smelled bad at the rear of the car. Possibly some type of exhaust. Problems can never be recreated for the repair people. The consequences of these stalls and repeatedly restarting will probably have a domino effect on other parts of the engine.",
"On December 24, 2009 I was driving my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee in heavy rain. I drove through some water and it quit. It was raining extremely hard. I had to have it towed to my house. My son is a Honda mechanic. He advised the engine was hydrolocked. Another mechanic looked at it and said it was hydrolocked. I had it towed to an independent shop. At first he advised it was hydrolocked and he would talk to the insurance company. Then he advised it was not water and did not know what caused it.
      Then I talked to the dealership, Gossett Chrysler Jeep in Memphis, TN. The service advisor told me it was hydrolocked. It was a common occurrence and insurance always covered it. The State Farm adjuster called the independent shop and told him I was having it towed to the dealership (none of her business). I had it towed to the dealership. The service adviser advised it was not water but advised I would have to pay to have it torn down to see if water caused it.State Farm advised the same thing. They advised it would take one day to tear it down and they would call me that day. They waited three more days. They advised it was not water and they did not know what caused the problem. The starter is damaged, the water pump and the engine. The engine has the first piston broken, numerous valve springs and the block is cracked. They wanted $10,060 for a new engine. The dealership advised it had a 36 months/ 100,000 mile warranty on it. After weeks of communication, they advised they would pay part and I would have to pay $5,500.Last Thursday, January 28, I sent an overnight letter to the CEO and Chairman of the Board. Today, I received a call from Mike **, Chrysler home office. He advised he thought the offer from the dealership was fair. He advised that the new engine would have a 36 months/36,000 mile warranty. I told him the dealership advised it would be 100,000 miles. He advised that no Chrysler/Jeep engine had a warranty of 100,000 miles. I told him that no one knows what caused the damage, but everyone knows it is not water. I have 23 payments with Chrysler Financial left on the Jeep.He advised that I should have purchased the extended warranty. I told him they wanted $150 a month for 5 years and that was too much. My Jeep lost power in water in July and October. It felt like the power steering belt got wet, but I was able to gain control. I have noticed other 2006 Jeeps had lost power after reading complaints on the internet. I am paying for a rental vehicle, which State Farm said they would pay. Then they changed it, saying since they were not paying for the repair, they would not pay the rental bill.I have been a State Farm customer for approximately 35 years and never filed a claim. I am a senior citizen and have a line of duty disability pension from injuries while a police officer. It was not revealed to me that my Jeep has a Mercedes engine and transmission and an European battery in it, when I purchased it. I had to have it towed when the battery quit because European batteries cannot be jumped. This vehicle is not safe for a woman to drive. It is not safe when it rains and it can't be jump started. My Jeep has been in the shop for nearly 2 months and no one knows what caused the problem. I have been in a rental vehicle since then.",
"I own a 2004 Grand Cherokee and have had the window regulators, three of them, replaced under warranty and now, I have had to replace one that they replaced just over a year ago.  They couldn't show me what failed other than to say that they have gone bad.  I took the one they replaced and it showed no sign of failure.  I've been reading that this seems to be a common problem. 
      At almost $500 a week, I can see why they won't admit they have a problem with these regulator assembly.  I want to know how many more time will these units go out?  I owned a 2000 Jeep Cherokee and never one had this problem.  I lost $488.00 and a half day of work.",
"Since buying our Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 1 1/2 years ago it, has been in the shop close to 10 times. Lately, 4 out of the last 5 times have been for an issue of when we are driving, the vehicle seems to go from 5th gear to 1st and then accelerates quickly back up to speed. It has caused us to almost get in several accidents, and one of the times almost driving off the side of the road. Each time we have taken it to the Jeep dealership, they have a new excuse or they don't know what the problem is. 
      Today the dealership called me (for the Jeep is in there again for repairs) and they said that it is throwing a code that says that someone is turning the car off and then back on while driving, and that's why it is doing that. I said that is a stupid thing to say. I said, ""So you're telling me that I'm driving down the freeway and through the mountains in Flagstaff at 70+ mph and I shut the vehicle off? They pretty much said yes and that they can't fix the problem. We paid over $40k for this vehicle and a monthly payment of $700, but not anymore. They can keep it. A voluntary repo.",
"Three months after purchasing a brand new 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, I began experiencing slips in the transmission (jerky motions that indicated the car might stall). Repeated visits to the dealership resulted in them telling me the car was ""learning"" my driving habits. A year after purchasing this vehicle, it began to stall at various speeds; sometimes restarting immediately, other times not. For two years I've written to and called Chrysler. I had it in to two dealerships as well as independent mechanics and no one can figure out or duplicate the problem.
      Yesterday the AZ ""expert"" from Chrysler rode in my car with me, my mechanic and the owner of Hatch Motors. His conclusion is that the vehicle runs within their normal guidelines! While he conceded that stalling is not normal, he had no suggestions on what to do about it.",
"I'm writing in reference to the articles about Jeep Grand Cherokee stalling problems. I own a 2000 Grand Cherokee with just over 127,000 miles on it and just recently began to experience the stalling. It will stall without warning driving at speed on the highway, coast for a few seconds, and then catch itself back in gear; but at slower speeds, it'll just die, have to be placed in park, and restarted. Sometimes, it will start immediately but sometimes may take a while. Major inconvenience when you're holding up traffic and potentially dangerous too.",
"2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee -  In 2002-03, it had Rotaries defect (3 times). I had to pay the 1st repairs. They told me it was because I was traveling through puddles of water too fast (found out that was a lie). In 2006, I had to replace the whole brake light (replaced bulb 4 times before changing the whole thing). In  2007-08, windows would not work on driver and passenger side (2 separate events). In 2008-09, door locks would not work. They repaired driver side, passenger side still does not work. I have talked with many Jeep owners in Marion, South Carolina and 3 family members and the same thing happened with theirs. It is not a coincidence. These jeeps are defective and we, the consumers, should be reimbursed for these problems.",
"My 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee has been in the shop since last December. It has huge electrical problems and when they said it was finally fixed and I picked it up, the check engine light and the problem recurred before I got home. The dealer is out of ideas. Chrysler/Jeep is unwilling to help. I have had to rent or borrow a car on a regular basis since Dec. 08.",
"I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee 2002. First, a year ago or so, the window busted. I took it to the dealership. I had no choice, it was raining and that was a $400 bill. Then last week, the light came on and the Jeep wouldn’t go into a high gear on a major highway. I went to Jeep in Fairfax and they said the transmission was bad, clutches burned out, $4,500 to fix-replace. Wow, it only has 68,000 miles on it. I said how can this be. 
      I drove 2 miles to work each way. So I went to AAMCO. They said $2,700 to rebuild. I have only 1 car so I had no choice but to get it fixed. I wrote a complaint letter. Jeep called today to say they may be able to help me. Then he came back on the line to say sorry, only if you had paid Jeep we might have been able to do something. I am just disgusted. I will never buy or refer anyone to buy one of their cheaply made vehicles. I am just sick and out another $3K.",
"On August 4, 2009, I was parking my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland at a shopping center when suddenly the jeep accelerated, jumped the curb and wiped out a large concrete planter and knocked down a light pole. The brake would not override the acceleration. Luckily, no one was on the sidewalk in front of me. This incident was reported to my local jeep dealer - both the service manager and the sales manager and ""supposedly"" to two Chrysler reps that were at the dealers that day who were going to ""look at the jeep"" at the auto repair shop next to the dealer. It has now been two months and I have not heard one word back.
      The damage to the shopping center was the broken planter and light pole. The damage to my jeep was mainly to the grill and front passenger side, as well as to three tires. My insurance company is paying for damages, but they should be reimbursed by Chrysler. In addition, my ""accident free"" insurance rates will increase. Lastly, even though my vehicle has been repaired, I am paranoid every time I get in it and I am afraid to drive it. Now that I am retired, I intended to keep this vehicle for another 5 years (58,000 miles).",
"Recently I purchased a 2004 Grand Cherokee Jeep. Had I known about others who have experienced unintended acceleration, I would never have purchased this vehicle. On two different occasions while my foot was on the brakes, the car lunged forward on its own like it was a rocket. The first time it happened, I had parked my car and was about to put it in park when it lunged forward going across the sidewalk and almost hitting a building before I was able to bring it to a stop. Luckily there was no damage although I was definitely shaken up. The second time it happened, I was parking the car in my garage in the same stall I always use. Again I was about to put the car in park when it lunged forward like a rocket. This time, I was not so lucky as both my garage and my car sustained damage. I have taken the vehicle to two different mechanics and they cannot find anything wrong with this vehicle. I am absolutely petrified about driving this car. After searching on the web, I just cannot believe that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will not recall these Jeeps. I found at least 40 complaints describing the same type of unintended acceleration involving Jeeps from 2000 - 2009. Wake up, Chrysler. What is wrong with you?",
"I have a 1999 Grand Cherokee Limited and it is having a stalling problem. So, I looked up the problem and found that there was a recall sent out for that problem. I called My Jeep in Salinas and explained what was wrong with mine and about the recall and they are refusing to fix it for free. I don't think this is fair. If there was a recall sent out for it, no matter where I bought it from, they should fix it at no cost to me.",
"I have a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I purchased from a used car dealer last year, and that has had stalling problems from the first month that I owned it. The stalling is very dangerous because it happens unexpectedly and loss of power steering occurs, and it could easily happen taking a curve on a freeway. I drive in fear of this, as I am currently unable to afford a new car. I have had the car to several mechanics, including a Chrysler dealership service center to try to have the problem fixed. That time I was told that I needed a new power-train control module and I got it replaced. The problem seemed to be fixed for about a week and then the stalling returned. I have had two other mechanics try their theories but only to experience a similar pattern of going away for a week or two and then returning to stalling.
      I go to school full time and only have money to work on it a couple times a year, but I have easily spent over $1500 on trying to fix the problem as well as towing and rental car fees. I wish Chrysler would allow me to bring the car in to be fixed once and for all. It seems impossible to fix permanently, but if anybody can fix the problem, I think they should have to figure it out. It's only a matter of time before someone has a serious accident due to this problem. I hope this complaint helps raise awareness of the issue to Chrysler.",
"I have a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its window regulators keep failing, costing $300 each time for parts and labor. My repair shop indicated it is a design flaw. I'm out $600 in repair costs, to date.",
"Two of my windows in my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee have stopped working due to a faulty regulator. It cost $480 to fix each one. There have been many complaints online about this happening to most Jeeps. Even the dealer said it was a defect, but we have to pay for it. **, they need to fix this problem before Americans only buy foreign cars. Consequences: my car got soaking wet inside due to rain when I found my back window fell down.",
"While Chrysler personnel have been kind and accommodating, my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland has not, since originally purchased. So many faults have occurred, I'm not certain I can recall all of them, nor the total costs for their repair. But it has been significant, not to mention the costs in lost availability of the car. Others have reported many of these same failings, but I may have some new ones to list. The brake rotors warped, and turned and now ready to turn again because of warping. The heater deflector door failure was repaired, but cold air still enters the passenger compartment necessitating covering our legs in winter. The window regulator's failure: first, the driver's door, now r/rear. It will no longer allow anyone to roll windows down. Mass Air Flow Sensor failure and Battery failure (shorted).
      The porous wheel castings are losing air, requiring checking the tire pressure before using the car. Air conditioner control valve failure - replaced. Ill-fitting door panels will not stay under trim seals, both front doors. All door weather strips are loose, requiring them to be cemented in place. Starter failure required a wrecker tow and a starter replacement. The radio trim panel cracked, no repair possible. Obviously, Chrysler has several vendor QA problems that need to be fixed.",
"I own a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 2005 and I have had nothing but problems with it stalling since I first purchased the vehicle. Shortly after I purchased it new, my husband and I were driving on the highway at over 60 miles per hour when the car just shut down with no warning sign. Luckily, we did not have any other cars behind us, or else, we would have been in a terrible car accident. It went into the shop for quite sometime for what they believed to be electrical problems. It seemed to have solved the problem for a while, but then it started again. It is now stalling again, and can happen when I'm driving fast, making a turn in the car, or idling in a drive through. There have been many times where I've almost been rear ended due to the problem.
      I'm afraid for my family's safety and I don't know what to do. When I took it into the shop, they said that it was a computer problem and had to download new software to my computer in my car. This seemed to work for a couple of days but then started occurring. Now, even I have problems where I can be idling and the engine revs really crazy, and the RPMs go way high and then way low.The mechanics have looked at it and are totally puzzled. They don't know what to do. Please help me before a bad accident occurs and potentially hurts my family. I see that this is a problem with many other people owning the same model of car. Why is this company able to make and sell a car that they know has potential harmful problems? This is not fair! Please help!",
"The front driver's side and passenger's side window regulators of my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo with approximately 102,000 miles on it have stopped functioning. The driver's side one went out about 2 months ago and the passenger's went out today. I have read many complaints online about this defect and Chrysler has not issued a recall. Dealer quotes are around $500 per window for parts and labor. It’s a very common problem and it seems that the window cable blocks are made of plastic and are weak and susceptible to melting in extreme hot weather. I am replacing the window regulators myself and just paid $100 for a pair of aftermarket window regulators and motors. Also, I am replacing the window cable blocks for metal ones at $120 for 4. Chrysler needs to recall these parts and fix them for their customers.",
"My Jeep Grand Cherokee has less than 44,000 miles, and I have had to replace three window regulators and three different windows, the last of which cost me over $500.00. I had to pay out of pocket two times for a defective part that should have been recalled.",
"I have a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and I have had to replace 3 of 4 window regulators. I keep reading that this is a common problem in these cars so I think that there should be a recall. I have had to spend $1,000 just by replacing those window regulators.",
"I purchased used 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee from used car lot in 2005, still under factory warranty. Since then, I have replaced the window regulators a total of 5 times. This is a common problem with the 2001-2004 Grand Cherokee and Chrysler refuses to do a recall. This has me more than $500 in parts, and hours in personal labor.",
This is the second time in six months that a window has fallen inside the door of my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I have been reading online where many other owners have this problem. It seems like this is a major problem for this vehicle and I cannot afford to have it fixed.,
"All four window regulators have failed at least once in my 2002 Grand Cherokee. Other than the driver's windows, they are rarely used. The two passenger side regulators failed within a week of each other. Both failed while not being used. The window just dropped into the door while driving. The struts holding the hood, rear door and rear window have also failed. It had been replaced and have gone bad again. The Jeep only has 64,000 miles on it. Over $1,000 spent with the dealer for repairs. Another $1,200 if I get the current failures repaired. I had been hit in the head by both the rear window and by the hood when the struts have failed. Also the loud snap and window dropping while driving down the interstate is a very dangerous distraction as well as a danger for young kids and animals in the vehicle.",
"My 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee window regulator failed. Driver's side fell down about 6 months ago, and the passenger's fell down two days ago. There should be a class action lawsuit on this.",
"Yesterday, May 23, 2009, was a nice day, so I spent the day working outside on flowerbeds and such. Two of my older kids were home when the incident took place. They had just come outside and were standing on the front porch. I was working with flowers standing about 5-9 feet away from my parked, non-running Jeep Grand Cherokee. Thank goodness, I wasn't standing much closer or right behind it, otherwise I would have probably had to go to hospital all cut up. So I was standing across from my parked Jeep in my driveway doing work outside when all of a sudden, I hear a big loud boom, crash. I looked all around and saw that all of a sudden for no reason at all, the whole back window of my Jeep Grand Cherokee just blew out, not in but out. I saw pieces of glass blown out all over the ground behind the back of the vehicle and it blew out with enough force that it even blew glass out onto the back top roof of the vehicle as well. 
      My back window had the pressurized lifters in attached to them for holding the window up if you ever open the back window. I rarely ever used my back window. In the last 3 years, I think I only lifted that back window myself maybe 4 times. That's it. It seems that the pressurized lifters burst themselves, opened all the way up inside the vehicle or something when no one was in it. The vehicle was parked in driveway. After the window busted out all over ground, etc., I walked over and looked at it and noticed that the 2 pressurized lifters which were attached to the rear glass back window are now stuck all the way open as when you open and lift up your back window. They are all the way open and stuck now on the outside back of the vehicle hanging out. I tried to push the silver back up into the black pressurized thing to get it back inside the vehicle instead of hanging them hang out but they won't budge all the way down and fully open and extended and won't close back up and go inside the vehicle. So this tells me it must have had something to do with those pressurized back window lifts. I'm thinking that's what blew out my whole back window in my Jeep. I took photos of it but other than that, I don't know what to do. I can't afford a new window to be put in right now. I can't believe that happened. Unreal! Has anyone else had this happen? Mine is a '96 Jeep Grand Cherokee that was in great condition except for that ABS light and service engine light being stuck on ever since I got it. I've read of people's window just falling, etc., but no one has specified as to rather or not the window fell and broke.Well now, I'm left with no back window at all. The whole thing was gone and no one even touched or was near the vehicle when this happened. Now, it's raining which started last night and continuing through today. I guess my Jeep inside the back is all wet. Great. And the back window pressurized lifters are stuck hanging outside the back of the vehicle fully extended all by themselves and I can't get them to go back inside the Jeep. I'm wondering if that will cause a problem now if I drive the Jeep somewhere with no back window and those two lifters hanging outside the back of vehicle. I think those pressurized lifter things should be removed and something else used in their place. Now I've discovered and witnessed the fact that this can happen. I can't afford right now to replace the window. And now it's raining so I'll also have a wet, moldy and smelly interior to go with my vanished back window. I'm just glad I wasn't standing closer to the vehicle or sitting outside closer behind it when the window blew out. I do believe I would have been injured, cut up if I had been because obviously, the force of it was pretty good, good enough to even blow glass up on the back top of the roof of vehicle as well as all around in a circular pattern around the whole back of the Jeep all over the ground. Has anyone else had this happen with those lifter things extended or bursting or whatever with their back window? I called and told my father about it. Of course, he doesn’t believe me (lol) but I got the proof, photos taken where you can see the lifters fully extended and hanging out on the outside of the vehicle unable to be pushed back in and inserted back on the inside; plus witnesses, myself and my one adult child and my other teenage child to vouch that no one was near vehicle. The window wasn't hit by anything. It wasn't shot as my dad first thought, etc. So I got the witnesses and the photos of it. I haven’t touched or driven vehicle since (lol). Now, I'm scared.",
"I have taken my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee in for window regulator repairs 4 times now - once for each window. I asked at the time that I called (around May 6, 2009), if there was a recall on the regulators because I thought it was odd that all 4 have gone out. The 2 front windows were repaired under warranty but I had to replace the 2 back windows myself, as the warranty had expired. The most recent was on May 6, 2009. When I asked about a recall, I was told there is none and that they don't have that many that come in with window regulator problems, which I find hard to believe. The 2 front windows went out within 6 month of each other and the 2 back windows broke within 3 months of each other. I do not understand why they continue to break and I think there should be a recall or some type of reimbursement for this. I have paid roughly $1000 in repair costs within 3 months. I'm still making truck payments, so I think this is outlandish. That would have been 2 truck payments. If there is a class action, count me in.",
"My sister rolled up the front passenger side window of my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, and we heard a strange pop when the window reached the top. She got scared and rolled the window down. The window went down ever so slowly, and once we could not see it anymore, the window would not go back up. When we push the power window button up, there is a very weak motorized sound; and when we push down, it sounds as if everything is fine. The window will now not close, and it is a Saturday afternoon. I am not sure if I will be able to find a place to repair it. Also, I read online that the fix could run around $500.",
"I bought my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland last year. I was so excited because this was my first car I bought and loved everything about it. Six months later, I was idling at a red light when the motor started wanting to die. The light turned green, so I pressed the gas to get to the shoulder where there was a gas station. I then called my father, who is a mechanic. He told me to turn if off and he'd be right there. So I turned off the Jeep. It was still idling really bad as I turned off the key. I really couldn't understand what was happening. I just bought this car and I don't drive very far. When my father got there, he lifted the hood and had me start it again. It was still idling really bad, so he had me press a little on the gas. That's when the rocker arm flew out of the motor and threw my valve cover. What the heck was that? 
      I asked my dad to call a tow truck and it's now been sitting at my house ever since. We have had no, and I mean no, luck finding a new head or another replacement parts. This is unreal. I was unable to purchase a warranty since this was a used car and it cost so much. I thought hell it's a great car and I shouldn't have to worry about this happening. Guess not. I just want to be able to drive my Jeep that I love so much and paying so much for. This isn't right nor fair. There has to be something I can do. Please help.",
"He sold me a 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it was not working right. Now on the Jeep, I had a 30-day warranty so what I did I tried to find everything that's wrong with the vehicle before my 30 days was up. So I took it. The first time they kept it for a week and they were supposed to have fixed it. But they did not fix it. My truck was pulling hard and sounded very loud and did not have them many miles on it. So I took it back the second time, they were supposed to have fixed it but they did not. So I ask for my $1300 back and they would not give it to me. The dude Charles said they could not give it back to me. So now my truck note is due and it is barely running and I don't know what to do. Could someone please help me and I have a sick child with heart problems need to go back and forward to Jackson. Please help me!!!!!!!!!",
"My wife pulled our 2004 V8 Jeep grand Cherokee into the day care to pick up our toddler and put the gear in park after coming to a stop. The Jeep suddenly accelerated and shot forward, with her foot tightly on the brake, and went over a concrete block, through a fence and into the yard on the other side. Just missed crashing into the house. She pressed the brake harder to make it stop but it accelerated and hit a tree before it stopped. We have had this jeep for over 5 year and it has been dealer serviced for the last 5 years. The air bag never deployed and when we called the jeep service center in San Jose, the service manager said that in the V8, the sensor is faulty and it sometimes accelerates when changing the gear to stop from neutral. If Chrysler/Jeep knew about this then why did they not recall and fix the sensor? What is Jeep waiting for???",
"I purchased a pre-owned 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee in October of 2006, it had 90k miles on it. Every year since I owned the jeep, it has gone to the shop at least three or more times, for stalling, not wanting to idle correctly, turning off when it wants to, dead battery... etc. Just had the Jeep again in the shop because the new battery I just put in the Jeep was completely dead the next morning, no power, no lights nothing. So got another new battery and put it in, drove the Jeep for less than a mile and it began to stall and wanted to die. I immediately drove to the dealer and informed them about the problem, left it there overnight only so they can tell me nothing is wrong. Cost $70.00, again! 
      Before this problem it was just in because my passenger side headlight stopped working when it wanted to, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't. What does the dealer say for this problem, Ahh... nothing's wrong, Again, $70.00!!! Now I am a route driver late at night in the middle of Iowa...Hmmm... guess what. Not only did the driver side headlight stop working, but the left turn signal will not turn off. So, I am in the middle of BFE in Iowa at 3:30 in the morning with one headlight and a turn signal that won't turn off. Next, I was waiting for the Jeep to die, but it didn't, good for me. Not only did I have to rent a car to get my job done, but guess again, back to the shop, Again. Oh! And this time I bet I'll pay more. I love Jeeps, but it is not worth it. I will get it fixed if they can, and get rid of it ASAP. Chrysler should be sued for putting out such a bad product, but like AIG, They get financial assistance, and what do we get, the bill to bail them out and the bill for our Jeeps going to the shop. Not buying Chrysler product ever again. Very disappointed.",
The two keys to my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee stopped working. Dealership says solder broke on both and new keys will cost $350.00. This is outrageous.Dealership should replace at no charge for poor workmanship or faulty design. There should be a recall.,
Both my driver's side and passenger side window regulators have broken within months of each other (Sept. 2008/Jan. 2009). I have a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I purchased new in Sept. 2003 and the warranty expired in Sept. 2008. This is a widespread problem in this model of Jeep and Chrysler is aware of the problem; however they have chosen to do nothing about it and the burden of repairing the vehicle is placed on the customer. It is not hard to see why the US vehicle market is in a dire state when they produce such poorly made vehicles. Their customer service is equally poor. A class action lawsuit or other compensation should be afforded to the customers for such a flagrant problem.,
We have owned two Jeeps since 2000 and have liked them both until now. My wife was pulling into a parking spot when our 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo's engine suddenly raced and then leaped forward with great force as she braked. No amount of pressure on the brake pedal would stop this rapid acceleration. The Jeep stopped when it hit a concrete planter about 3 feet away. Damage was $4208 to the jeep. I have read of over 80 incidents of this nature with with Jeep on the NHSTA and Consumer Affairs websites. Has anyone investigated this? How should we proceed?,

"My new vehicle had to have the brakes resurfaced and the pads replaced about 6,700 miles. I had to have the pads changed again at about 16,000 miles. It was told to me they would not replace any brake parts again if I have anymore problems after this last repair. I continue to hear a small grind noise with my brakes at times when I brake. I bought my '08' Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 in 2007 of Sept. I have not had the auto 2 years, yet I continue to have brake problems that the dealership will not cover in the future. FYI, I used to own an '07' Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 that gave me the same problems with under 10,000 miles that I had to have repaired by the dealer.",
"I am the original owner of a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. In January of 2009, my passenger side window just slowly fell down. It was cold & raining beyond belief. Of course I had to get it fixed - $430.00 later, I am warm & dry. It was a regulator. However, Now I cannot open the hatchback door in the rear. It may be a solenoid. I am angry. Of course Chrysler turns their heads to any and all of this. I will NEVER buy a Chrysler again.",
"2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 21k miles. Has stalling problem. Vehicle will just quit and it happens at highway speeds. Have taken the vehicle to this dealership 4 times for same problem. The Service manager questions us as to why we are bringing it back because each time, they cannot diagnose. The last time we brought it back (January 31, 2009), we had a 9:30 am appointment. We were told to return by 4:30 pm because they close at 5:00 pm. When we returned, they had not even looked at the vehicle. I called Chrysler customer service at 800-853-1403 for assistance. I ended up speaking to a call center in India and to a person with an accent that did not know what the word stalled meant. After communicating the issues we had with the dealer, the only advice they could give was to take it back for a diagnosis. I explained we had been to the dealer four times in the past month already. Chrysler Customer service said they could not do anything until the vehicle was diagnosed by the dealer. I then asked if I could get a rental while the dealer attempted to find out what the problem is. The Chrysler rep would not agree to a rental.",

"I bought a 2006 Grand Cherokee from Lunde Jeep in Fargo, ND in July 2007. It was a factory rep's vehicle with 4000 miles on it. I drive a lot and this past winter it has developed the problem of all the warning lights coming on for a few seconds then off. This problem occurs even when idling as that has happened several times also. Called Lunde when this problem first occurred and they said yes, they had another vehicle that does the same thing but do not know how to fix it. So am reluctant to take it in just to start changing parts until they find something that fixes it. I'm out of warranty so this could cost a great deal of money. I like the vehicle otherwise but would like this problem solved. The vehicle had about 30,000 miles when the problem started.",

"2005 Grand Cherokee Laredo 5.7 Litre. Purchased the vehicle new in February of 2005. Started having problems with starting in August 2005. Had towed to dealer and it sat there five days before they could figure it out. Since then has been in the dealer shop 7 times for electrical problems. Last time this for 2 weeks. Electrical module. On third battery, Second alternator. Driver door lock freezes at 32 degrees. Have to heat up key with a lighter. Water leaks into car. This car was built wrong. Called Chrysler. They could care less. Car has 37,000 miles on it. Car is unreliable. Bought it to go skiing but cannot trust it. Why anyone would buy a Chrysler is a mystery to me. Even the road guys at AAA who I had to call plenty said Chrysler Jeep is notorious for electrical problems. They build cars they can't fix.

"I also own a 03 Jeep Grand Cherokee, I have had it for 3 years this month. Here is a list of problems I have had: no heat/AC (I live in Md so it's hot as you know what in the summer and cold as you know what in the winter) for 2 years, rear driver side window broken (we have it rigged up), wiring harness w/plug to heater blower motor resistor has burnt up twice (what a nasty smell that was), hood will no longer stay up (I use a stick for a hood prop), have had the water pump replaced twice (I had to be towed for this one $$$$$), and last but not least, I had to have both of the sensor replaced (one on the camshaft and one on the crankshaft, they both went bad at the same time). So here I go again, another cold winter. It really scares me when I'm driving to work at 3:30am and can't see a thing (lots of wild animals where I live). I just wish Jeep (DaimlerChrysler) would stand up and do the right thing before someone dies as a result of their negligence. Sorry if I misspelled any words I'm a bad speller.",
"Another Jeep stalling problem! I have been dealing with this car problem for weeks. My 98' Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo shuts down so suddenly while driving, idling, turning, or stopping. I can not predict when and how it happens. One day the car runs fine and next day I can't even leave my home. This car has been in and out of repair shops for 3 weeks. Mechanics repaired ignition coils and ASD relay, but it didn't solve a problem. And they over charged me big time made my situation worse (But this is an another story and another complaint to make). 
      Now, they are suspecting another parts and want to repair them. Another expensive repair! And there is no guarantee to fix the problem. Nobody seems to know what exactly is wrong. I found some other similar complaints in this web site and tried to call Chrysler at 1-800-853-1401. Did you know this number is no longer in use? Does anybody try to contact Chrysler?",
"I have a 1999 jeep grand Cherokee limited. #1Heater AC blend doors. This is a fix that will cost you $800-$1200 if you take it to a dealer. I bought parts online and fixed it myself because of the price. When I removed the stock parts they literally crumbled in my hands, with such a high percentage of jeeps having this same problem (which is re-occurring when the dealerships fix it) owners need to be given at least some sort of permanent solution which can be performed by the dealer at a lower cost. #2 Warped Rotors. All four wheels have disc brakes and inconsistent pressures are applied to the rotors. This causes a massive and uncontrollable wobble that randomly occurs when you apply the brakes or hit a bump. When one rotor superheats and warps causing you to lose control, you need to buy a new rotor or possibly die. These are not reasonable options! 
      #3 Radio malfunction. This one won't kill you as far as I know but it really gets annoying when your 10 disc can't and never has been able to read a disc, the speakers crackle and the head unit cuts in and out. WTF! Sometimes you just need to power it all down and calm your nerves. #4 Key chip. They just wear out.... A lot more often than they should! This one gets expensive because they can't just make you a new key, the dealership has to bend you over with all kinds of tests that cost money, then they can make you a $40 dollar key.",
"2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee - Heater stopped working (turn on control, nothing happens); turn signals stopped working at the same time but the flashers do work. Dealership charged us $160.00 for a diagnostic stating the heater motor, heater blower resistor module, and the multi-function switch were all inoperative; we replaced all through a private, certified mechanic (still expensive but not as bad as the dealer). Problem still exists. Fuse was blown so I think its some kind of power surge going through that part of the harness, or maybe some kind of short, coming from where? Dealer head mechanic told me that replacing those parts would of just been them working their way through the issue.",
"We have had Jeeps all our adult lives. Eight in total. We have 2 now. One a 1996 with 178K miles and one a 2004 with 46K miles. The 2004, which is the top of the line Grand Cherokee with all the bells and whistles, even having regularly scheduled dealer service every 3000 miles, we have had nothing but headaches. The Jeep 04 has had a recall on the heated seats. We have continually had to pull pressure dents out of the hatchback door. The cause yet to be determined. 
      We spent $700 on fixing the A/C and heat because the heat was blowing cold and there was a crack in the A/C. And most recently, getting stuck in parking lots due to a dead battery. We had some sort of fluid explosion, which we believe to be battery acid in our engine while we were driving to other state, but the certified technicians at the dealer could not identify that problem so there was no solution. NOW we have no power in any of the power windows and all the electrical is dim. So we parked it and scheduled an appointment with the local Jeep dealer AGAIN. Now the battery is dead again. If I was a mechanic, this would be a non-issue but we purchase Jeeps because we have never had problems until now. All these problems are making getting to work a major pain. I spoke with Chrysler and they said to have a dealer diagnose the problem. The price tag to fix our current electrical issue $1200. If this is the type of quality these guys are pushing off the line these days it's no wondered that need a bailout!! WE ARE SERIOUSLY UPSET with a 40K automobile with 40K miles that is continually breaking down! Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. We just can't afford these types of unrelated irregular maintenance issues.",
"There is a widespread and well-known heater/AC problem with many Jeep Grand Cherokees. I own a 2002 and the heat has recently stopped working on the driver's side. The vents only blow out cold air and since it is about 30 degrees right now, I will need to get this fixed right away. I brought it to my mechanic and he said it was most likely the heater door that had broken and only a dealership could fix. This repair involves removal of the entire dashboard, steering wheel etc., with costs estimated that typically run anywhere from $800 to $1200. Not to mention it does not always fix the problem in the long run. I also found information online on sites like Heatertreater.net which sell kits to fix this exact problem, for all Jeep models and year ranges from 1997-2006. So it seems this issue affects much of their product line. 
      There are also numerous complaints posted online by other frustrated Jeep owners just like myself who have experienced the same issue, one such site: ** where the issue is described specifically: the A/C and heating problems in GCs is most often caused by broken blend doors, which control the flows of hot and cold air. If this problem is mainly due to a faulty or poor-quality part and the only fix is to go back to a Jeep dealership for a high-cost repair (and sometimes repeatedly), I think this should definitely be investigated or considered for a recall. I greatly appreciate any help you can provide on this matter. Thank you for your time.",
"2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, purchased 1 year ago, has stalled out 4 times, 4 different conditions (side roads going slowly, interstate going 70 mph, etc.). Car completely shuts down and has to be pulled over and put in PARK to re-start.",
"I have replaced every window regulator in my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee at $300-350 each. As of last week, we are on round two, this will be window number 5. Air conditioner only comes through the defrost vents, the CD player sucks, I have had to replace some part in the transmission for $800.00. It also has an evaporative leak and the power locks on one door do not work. Also, if I go over a large bump, I almost lose control of the stupid thing. What a disappointment and a waste. I will never buy another Jeep.",
"2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee - Electrical problems. I purchased my car in '07 used with 27k miles. Less than a year later, I was having electrical problems. All dash indicator lights will come on and flash. Headlights turn on and off. Instrument gauges turn off and then back on… very scary when driving. Taken to dealership 3 times now. They say that it's nothing wrong and still not fixed. The dealership is treating me poorly. Telling me it's impossible to diagnose any electrical issue. 
      Now I have my warranty expired. I talk to Chrysler about the problem before the warranty expires and they tell me that if the dealer can do nothing, they neither. I actually have another trouble that they tell me they can find. They treat me like if I was crazy or lying about, then I figure out that the problems exist and it's documented on the Mitchell Software for repair shop, and they have it documented since 2006 - so who it's the liar? How can that be?? This is a safety issue. When this happens my lights won't work and neither do my turn signals. My gauges don't work. It's dangerous to drive - but they don't care.",
I have had my second window regulator go bad in my '03 Grand Cherokee. This last one cost me $440 to get fixed. Last Jeep I will buy.,
"1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee V6 4.0L.
      It will stall randomly all the time and is currently getting even worse. I have taken it into two different mechanics shops of which neither can find out what exactly is wrong with it. So far i've replaced the fuel filter, relays, cat converter and removed the 2 long bolts that cause computer to short circuit. So far each will fix the problem for about a week or so but then the problem will just come right back.",
"While driving my 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, it stalls and at times I am in heavy traffic. It seems to start right away after the stall. When it stalls, I lose all power to my power steering and it gets hard to steer. This has happened to me three times today while I was on a very busy highway. Has there been a recall for 1996 Jeeps with this problem? I see there has been a recall for newer Jeeps.",
2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Three windows went down within a month. I see that I am not alone. Driver side went down and was covered under warranty.,
"I purchased a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo about 2 years ago. All was well (besides the passenger window regulator needed to be replaced which is another defective part manufactured by Chrysler). In February of 2008, I started experiencing stalling while the car was idling and while running at speed up to 70mph. At this time, I took my vehicle to Courtesy Dodge and the problem was diagnosed as a bad Crank Shaft Sensor and was replaced. After spending $400, less than 8 months later the same problem is reoccurring, only worse now. Not only is it stalling several times a day and sometimes several times within a mile, but once the car stalls it is difficult to pull over to the side of the road. Once it is stopped at times, it cranks up right away and other times, it takes many attempts. There have been times I have had to leave it on the side of the road to return later and try to restart it. 
      Several mechanics have stated that this problem is the main wire harness to the ECM and possibly the Crank Shaft Sensor. Being that this Sensor falls into the 12 month warranty I took it into Chrysler Dodge. Told them that the same problem is reoccurring, and that our mechanic said that the sensor was never replaced because it was still the original stock part and chances are the computer was reset to overlook the problem and a bill was written up for a part and labor that was never done. Chrysler Dodge argues that the work was done and now insisted that the problem is not the Crank Shaft Sensor but rather the Wire-Harness to the ECM. Why was this not diagnosed the first time I brought it into the shop for the same problem that has only gotten worse? When my husband and I sat down with the Service Manager he was rude and is not concerned about our needs. We were told that Chrysler had stopped using these wire-harnesses due to the amount of problems that had been occurring. The manager said they could fix the wire-harness, but isn't that basically the same thing as putting a bandage on the problem? After researching Consumer Complaints on Chrysler products, especially Jeep SUVS (many of them the Grand Cherokees), I had printed out hundreds of pages of other consumers experiencing the same problems of stalling. Like myself, they are concerned about the safety of having these vehicles on the road. What was thought to be a reliable name brand has turned into a nightmare sucking every penny earned to find a solution. Others have stated the dealerships are unable to locate and solve this stalling issue and are in essence making more money off of this faulty product. The Chrysler Consumer Hotline has said due to the age of my vehicle, they are unable to financially assist, and also stated that the wire harness was available for purchase. But when we called Courtesy Dodge they stated that this wire-harness has been discontinued and is unavailable.",
"I purchased a 2004 Grand Cherokee Limited Edition new. This vehicle has 21,000 miles on it and I have replaced a throttle censor, and the front drivers and passenger side window motor assembly. Now the driver side rear window fell down. The vehicle is out of warranty. The dealer wants over $450.00 to fix this. I went to a glass shop and paid around $350.00 each for the front windows because they were cheaper than the dealer. I called Chrysler (claim number **) to make a complaint about this, and I was told to take it to the dealer for a diagnosis, then call Chrysler back and maybe they can help me with the payment, but they couldn't guarantee it, and I would be responsible for the diagnosis fee. I told Chrysler that if they couldn't guarantee it I was taking it somewhere cheaper. I also asked why there wasn't a recall on this, and she said it was because the windows falling down aren't a safety issue. I looked on Consumer Affairs and found over 90 complaints because of the windows falling down.",
"Me and my wife bought a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Green in September of 2007. The vehicle had 39,000 miles when we bought it. Our total finance on the vehicle topped $20,000. The moment we drove it home we were upside down on our Jeep by almost $5,000. We also purchased a powertrain plus warranty for $2,000 which at the time I was told covered ALL of the electrical systems. Now the Jeep has just over 50,000 miles on it and we have a list of issues. The check engine light is on and it kicks out of overdrive on the interstate which also disables the cruise control. The dealer says that it is the throttle position sensor that is causing these problems. The driver side window will not roll up - this is from the window motor. 
      While doing some research on the internet I have found that this is a very common problem with Jeeps in general. Some people have claimed to have to replace this part up to 7 times. The dealer says that neither of these 2 problems are covered under our warranty. We also have an issue with the driver side mirror not staying in place. I feel that these issues are a result of Jeep/Chrysler’s use of poor quality parts, poor craftsmanship, and overall poor quality control procedures. I also feel that I was ripped off by the dealership. I realize now that I should have known better but the tactics this place uses to push cars out the door almost feels predatory.",
"I have a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 6L. I have notice that you either love Jeeps or you hate them. I personally still love my Jeep even with the repairs.

"2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee (recent purchase). While driving vehicle, driver inadvertently hits knee on ignition, shutting off car including lock-up of steering. This is very dangerous. We can't be the only people with this complaint. Has there been a recall or fix mandated?",
"My daughter has a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Her passenger rear window fell while driving in the summer of 2008, and the dealer told her over the phone it would be around 4hundred and something dollars to repair. She could not afford this. I sent the information to the Chrysler Corporation and was told that they would not be able to help her. I was able to get the part for her and read how to replace it. BY OCTOBER OF 2008, I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE DRIVER REAR AND THE DRIVER DOOR. I have the three pieces I replaced and they are all broken in the same place. It is a plastic piece where the end of the cables lock in. I can prove that with these parts. Now, the heater will not work in the jeep. From reading about others with the same complaint, I can see it looks to be another big problem with jeeps.",
I own a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and all four windows have dropped in the last 4 yrs of ownership. I have paid approximately $1500 for window regulators.,
"I own a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and all four windows have dropped in the last 4 yrs of ownership. I have paid approximately $1500 for window regulators. I have a grandchild who sits in the back seat. The window just dropped, it was pouring rainy and he got soaked. It is truly a safety hazard and quite expensive to have the repairs performed. Jeep needs to have a recall and reimburse individuals for the dollars spent on this known defect. And people wonder why we purchase foreign made products. Go figure. I do not recommend Jeep to anyone. If you have one get rid of it quick. If you are contemplating purchasing one, forget it!",
"I own a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. In the spring of 2007, my driver's side window regulator broke (the window fell, would not roll up or down). I had it replaced. In October 2007, the same thing happened to my passenger side window. In May 2008, the same to my right rear passenger window, and in Sept 2008, the same to my left rear passenger window. All windows have failed within one year of each other. I do not have the money to fix these, and believe that Chrysler should issue a recall to repair the windows. Of course, the car is no longer under warranty.",
"I have a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and it will randomly stall at any given time. I have been dealing with this for about 9 months now. It has been to the dealership and they said it was the plugs, cap, rotor and wires. Replaced that. Then I took it to my regular mechanic and he did a test on it and he said it was the ignition coil. Replaced that. Then it was back again at the mechanic and another diagnostics test done and nothing found. Did a fuel pressure test on it and came out fine. Had the battery and alt. checked and that was fine too. I have had several more diagnostics tests done on it when it was acting up bad and each time it comes back that they can't recreate the problem and that they can't find anything wrong. It also has a new radiator, map sensor and new IACV. Nothing seems to work. It is getting scary to drive it and I have 2 small children. I am going out of my mind. I know that there is something wrong with it and no one can find it.",
"2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, which I bought new and has 36000 miles has had numerous problems. The one I'm writing about is that the power window regulator mechanism broke and my driver side rear door window is stuck in the lowered position. The power window regulator failure is a massive defect affected thousands of Jeep owners, if not the entire Chrysler line, as evidenced by the amount of Internet groups discussing the issue. It will cost at least $400 to replace.",
"My 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee was in for repair for 6 months. The alarm kept going off, the interior lights going from dim to bright, and so on. I filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation, because it cost me over $600 dollars for a small jumper that was shorted out in the driver's side. When I checked into the problem, there were other similar faults and the parts were on back order. I spoke with a certified mechanic and I was informed that was a fault on almost all Jeep Grand Cherokees. This should have been a recall. Now, I have a problem with it stalling when I come to a stop, either a traffic light or stop sign. I researched this fault and it appears there has been a recall on newer Jeeps but not older Jeeps. This vehicle is starting to turn into a money pit.",
"My 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo has now had every one of its four window regulators fail, with less than 100,000 miles on the car. The dealership mechanics admit that there is an inherent fault in the design, but Jeep refuses to issue a recall. Three of these regulators failed while the vehicle was in motion, causing a safety hazard.",
"I have owned my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee for about 3 years now. The beginning problems were no real fuss and were adjusted with little problem. This one would expect from any used vehicle. However, about 3.5 weeks ago, my Jeep started sputtering and stalling for no reason that can be found. No dashboard lights come on, and the computer is finding nothing. I have had 2 sensors replaced before it went to the dealership. They replaced the ignition switch, and it is still acting up. They refuse to tell me if anything is covered by the warranty, saying that it is just time. Yes, it is just time, just time that I can't get from place to place in this town that has no public transportation, time that I can't get to work, go grocery shopping, or get my laundry done! 
      They give me lame excuses about being stocked up with other work and not being able to get around to my vehicle. I would think 2 weeks is plenty of time to get to my vehicle! They should have contacted their superiors and the Jeep builders to find out if anything had been reported similar to this happening and see what may need to be replaced, but they have not done so. Meanwhile, I'm here sitting on my hands and wondering whether I will ever see my Jeep again. I am disgusted and will never buy a Jeep again, any more than I would have bought a Chrysler. Since that company bought out Jeep, it has gone severely downhill.",
"I Have an pre-owned 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee and its about to be winter and I have no heat. The blower works but its just blows cold air. Just bought the vehicle as is from a local small dealership. I like the car but I've been reading up on Jeeps and there are a lot of people having the same problems. Its an 02, the car is not that old, why isn't there any kind of recall. I'll tell you why, well its kind of obvious. Jeep doesn't want to pay to have it fixed so a lot of people are getting screwed and have to pay out of their own pockets. So now a days you have to decide whether fix your Jeep, or pay the mortgage or whatever. You see where I am going with this. I've also read that it is not an easy fix and you have to shell out a lot of money which not everybody has. All I'm all, you buy a car, spend thousands of dollars, it should work right.",
My 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo was purchased less than 1 year ago. Now it is stalling and dying on the road and no one can fix it. The on-board computer showed a transmission code once. But now shows nothing. No one can figure out how to fix. I have also received word of other Jeep owners with this issue who do not know how to fix it. Also the dealer failed to issue the CarFax report when requested. This could have solved many problems with part warranties.,
"Within one month, my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 3 out of 4 windows stopped working. They have either fallen off the track or motor broke, etc. After researching this problem, I've noticed hundreds of stories about Jeeps with the same problem. A recall needs to be made about this.
      I am unable to put my windows down or up. I've called many service departments to fix this problem and most want $300-$400 per window to get fixed. At this time, I am unable to afford this expensive defect and unable to use the power windows.",
"I was putting my windows up earlier today when I heard a pop sound. I looked at my drivers window and it would no longer move. I went to get it looked at and before the service guy even looked at my truck he said oh yea, this happens to all jeeps. Next your back window will go.
      After reading similar reviews on Jeeps I am shocked to see that this problem is not a recall. I also have a problem with my a/c. It sounds like it's blowing air but nothing is coming out of the vents. Too bad, because other than these problems I love my Grand Cherokee.",
"A few months ago, the passenger window of our Grand Cherokee Jeep (model, Loredo, 2004)slid into the door frame because the regulator broke on its own.  The cost to fix it would be at least $250, for the part alone.  We decided to screw our window in place until we felt more financially secure.  Then, this past weekend the passenger window did the same thing--and it's the same problem as our other window. We talked to Jeep/Chrysler customer representatives and they said we had to take it to a dealership, pay the $200 just to get a diagnosis, and then talk to Jeep again to see if they'll pay for any part of the damages.  
      We have looked at other consumer websites to find thousands (no exaggeration) of complaints regarding the same problem.  Those who spoke with Chrysler/Jeep found no help there, and were only forced to pay the money to the dealerships with no assistance from the Jeep corporation.  All the repair people we talk to say this is very common in Jeeps.  This is clearly a default of manufacturing.   Also in our review of consumer ratings, we have discovered that hundreds of people are having problems with their heating/air-conditioning.  This is also one of our problems.  One side of the vehicle will blow cool air while the only side only produces warm/hot air, simultaneously.   These parts should be recalled and owners should be compensated.  Jeep/Chrysler is not fully addressing problems nor are they rightfully acknowleding the complaints of thousands of customers.  People are already paying enough to buy new vehicles and insure them.  They should not be forced to pay more to Jeep/Chrysler for faulty manufacturing.We have been greatly stressed trying to find repairmen who can fix the vehicles.  There is a great financial burden as two windows are no longer working.  Chrysler has been extremely unhelpful when we attempt to get these problems corrected.",
My husband and I own a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 99k miles on it. We bought it new. There have been several issues with it (mostly covered by the extended warranty) but the most frustrating is the recent one that now sounds like a growing issue for many jeep owners. I cannot believe that it is going to cost us $1500.00 to fix the heating/air vents. The vents will not blow the cold/hot air out even though you can hear the fan running. Instead I get the outside air flowing through the glove box. This should be covered under the warranty or recalled. Shame on Jeep! I will never buy another Jeep.,
"I own a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I love my Jeep, but I've had a few annoying problems. Currently, I have replaced 3 of the 4 power window motors. Then, my ignition cylinder had to be rekeyed. The steering wheel would lock up, and the key would not turn. Although that sounds like a common issue that could be solved by simply turning the wheel, the ignition would lock and not turn at all. So that had to be rekeyed.",
"I own a 2002 JEEP Grand Cherokee. In 2007 replaced transmission, 2008 replaced cooling fan relay (fan would run when vehicle was not), replaced 2 window regulators. Now need to replace another. Replaced the radiator a couple weeks ago (blew hole in it )fan didn't come on, replaced relay again, now the cooling fan motor is bad. Replaced something in the steering column dealing with airbag (that's all I need for that to go off while going down the road).  All of this happened within a year. Window regulators  broke within weeks of each other. 
      Really don't have the money for any more payments on something that is paid for.",
"I am the owner of a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and I have just had my 3rd window regulator break in the last year!  I am so sick of this happening. I will NEVER buy another Chrysler automobile again. I have been burned twice they them and will tell everyone I know not to buy Chrysler cars EITHER!
      3 broken windows. One has been replaced but 2 are still broken.  It is going to cost almost $1000.00 to get the 2 windows fixed!",
"I too own a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I bought it used, but still in warranty. While still in warranty, it was in the shop 4 times for a transmission leak. Within months of running out of warranty, both my heated seats quit working. I have replaced both front window regulators and need to replace a rear one now, but have had difficulty finding the part. My exhaust manifold is cracked. My drivers side A/C blows cold air only and my passenger side blows hot air only. 
      My power steering hydraulic line is leaking, again. The first repair of that was awful, and I am not looking forward to repairing that again. Fortunately, I am able to do most of the repairs myself, and have family that have been able to help with the repairs I cannot make on my own. I am a single mom with 2 kids who works hard to support my family. I can't afford to keep repairing this thing and I can't afford to trade it in, as it is only worth $4000. (I think the car dealers know about the problems too.) And yes, I love my Jeep. I have complained to Jeep with no results. Jeep does need to consider things such as safety. If I get into my Jeep late at night and find someone in it because the window fell, or find it missing the radio, dvd player, etc... I can't defrost the windows in the winter and you can't run the AC in the summer. Those things to me are safety issues and need to be addressed.",
"My wife has a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 112,000 miles on it. Last month her driver side window made a popping sound and fell down. She could not raise it.

"I'm just writing to report that after having my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited stall on me about 10 times over the past 6 months that I think that Jeep should extend it's recall. I have found that this issue exists in several of the Jeep vehicles.  Please address this as this is a very dangerous issue.   
      My Jeep completely loses power, no steering, no electrical, no lights, no engine-without warning and happens at very random times, having nothing to do with speed, temp, acceleration etc.  This issue with the Jeep could have catastrophic consequences for it's owners.  This has happened to me at night on the highway with my small child-and a white vehicle with no lights is very difficult to see. Please do something about this issue with Jeep!",
"I have a '04 Jeep Grand Cherokee have had it for 4 years. Six months after purchasing the car transmission went out. Had extended warranty had to pay $100.00. Year later steering makes popping noise still no one can fix. About a 2 wks. ago all 4 windows will not roll down or up. Driver side panel nothing works, passenger front side lock works only. Yesterday, brakes are making a grinding noise. 
      After reading other people's same issues with Jeep Chrysler vehicles I believe a class action suit would be appropriate. Transmission without warranty over $1500.00 each window $500 for regulator Steering issue over $500 and now brakes go tomorrow to find out how much this will cost.",
"We've had our 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo for about 2 years now. We've had nothing but problems. First, we've had the passenger front window fall. Then we noticed the grinding, or rather jerking when hitting the breaks. The car wouldn't start about a week ago, so replaced the battery and thought we were all good. Now today, a week later, the anti-theft device does not recognize the key, so it won't start! The engine light has been on since a week after we bought it. The heat and air do not work right. We now have a vehicle that we owe $10,000 on, just sitting in the garage! Jeep has never contact us about any defects or recalls. I can't afford to just keep putting money into this car. I called Jeep. She said she would be happy to help me. After taking all my information, all she said was that I would have to contact a Jeep dealer. Why take all the info then???? I called a couple of dealers, and told them, I'd like to have an idea before I go to have it towed there. The wouldn't tell me anything. What now?",
"Several months ago upon taking my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee in for a routine oil change, I was informed that my Jeep requires $1400 worth of maintenance. Upon hearing this, I was very distraught. My vehicle was under warranty and yet these charges were my responsibility. They informed me I needed new breaks, new rotors, new tires, and my transmission was leaking! This vehicle is only 3 years old- 45,000 miles- why in the world does my new car need so much work done? 
      Then to top it off 2 days ago, when taking my car for inspection, it failed because I have a busted strut on my drivers side. I haven't hit any bumps, they're not in need of replacement, and yet it's busted? I've tried to trade it in, but can't because nobody will give me anything for it- I owe too much on it still.  I loved my Jeep, but it seems to be falling apart right in front of me! I have paid a lot of money and taken good care of this vehicle and now I'm not going to be able to drive it much longer.  What is a person to do?",
"I wish that I had heard of a death wobble before I spent money on multiple front-end alignments and new tires. I own a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee - and from the beginning I would get this shaking and wobbling especially while on the highway. Sometimes, the vehicle would shake so badly that I would have to pull over to get out of traffic. This has gone on for years, but just recently I brought my car into the shop for a hesitation problem and the mechanic told me that the check engine light was not my biggest problem, he said that I needed to replace my entire steering system. 
      He said that the steering rod was about to fall off of the vehicle. When I saw the condition of the parts I thank God for my safety and that of my children. I bought this vehicle brand new and even though it is ten years old I am the original owner and have only 70,000 miles on it. It is my understanding that Jeep is aware of this problem,and that it is a design flaw. I would like to know if later models like 2003 - 2008 are still having problems with this shaking, which ultimately leads to the wear and tear of parts that should be lifetime parts.",
"We own a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and are having to replace the front passenger window regulator for the second time. We have replaced the rear passenger window regulator twice already, and had to the same to our 1994 Jeep windows, as well. We love our Jeeps, but cannot understand why this issue is not being addressed? What does it take for the company to step up to this and do something about it?",
"The intake manifold in my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee is cracked and there is no lead time for when I will actually receive a part from Chrysler. My husband has called for two weeks now to the local office in the US with no response but to fill the voice mail box of the woman that works for them. 
      I have been without a car now for two months with no way to repair my six year old Jeep. Now that is backing a product!",

"I own a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. At 79,000 miles my passenger side electric window motor and regulator broke. Three days later the Drivers side did the same thing. May Jeep owners are complaining about this same issue. It appears that there is a factory defect in those particular motors and regulators. I need help because the repair cost for each window is $450 EACH.",
"My 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee is the [worst] machine ever!  I have had problems from day 1.  My Jeep has been in the shop over 20 times for different items going wrong such as my rear axle leaking fluid, heater and AC going out, ALL OF MY WINDOWS HAVE FALLEN OFF THE TRACKS with the rear passenger doing it twice!!!  $550 every time that happens!  My key was stuck in the ignition.  
      One of my tire fender plastic part fell off.  My tire pressure monitor doesn't work anymore and now my transmission is shot!  All of this with 80,000 miles.  There are many more problems too!  I was reading and there are many similar complaints so if anyone has advice on who I can complain to in order to get something done, please let me know.",
"Purchased 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee in 4/05 w/30,000 miles.  Consistently experiencing problems with heat and a/c.  After 3rd visit to dealer, problem diagnosed as faulty heat box (not covered under warranty).  Service manger confided that it is a common problem/defect in this particular automobile and thought that manufacturer should be responsible for repair costs (approx. $750-950). Research also indicates that other consumers have experienced this problem.   How can I relay this to the manufacturer without revealing my source of information?

"Jeep is aware of issues with transfer cases in the Grand Cherokee Laredo. A recall was issued for 1990-98 model years, but mine is a 2000.  I've replaced the transfer case in my vehicle TWICE, at $1300 each occurrence.  I've contacted Jeep customer service & have been told that NOTHING could be done.  Jeep does not wish to be responsible for their own mess.  
      I have read MANY other consumer complaints relating to Jeep transfer cases.  The problem is obviously not unique to my vehicle. I have replaced the transfer case in my Jeep GC twice.  The repairs have cost me a total of $2600.  This is part that is intended to be a lifetime part & should not have to be replaced at all.",
"Replaced defective window regulator...$400.00 on driver's side of my 2004 Grand Cherokee. The passenger side has just dropped also. This is extremely costly! I understand this problem is epidemic! These regulators are obviously defective. The dealers say if they are replaced at a garage (always for less), there's no chance of reimbursement on future breaks!

"When I purchased my Jeep in 2005, I believed that I was buying a reliable vehicle. Since then I have had many problems with my 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee to say the least. I have taken my vehicle to Ingram Park Auto Center (IPAC) Jeep dealership. All of these problems were due to product defect. These problems listed below range from water contamination in the transmission, faulty ignition switch, faulty transmission O-rings, faulty shifter, and faulty blower motor resistor, to faulty cancel cam. The vehicle has not even reached 40,000 miles, and so far it has had multiple defects. I believe that I am driving a lemon?. 
      I do not believe that I would recommend a Jeep to anyone. 9/19/2005 7,075 miles Check engine light came on. Vehicle had contamination/water in the transmission. IPAC flushed transmission, replaced gasket, filter, seal, oil filler tube. 10/3/2005 7,373 miles Check engine light came on and transmission started shuddering. IPAC stated that SOP ESM part on back order. 10/17/2005 8,410 miles Check engine light came on. IPAC replaced shifter and gearshift-console. 10/26/2005 8,722 miles Returned to IPAC because service tech on stained passenger seat and headliner. Washtub cleaned seats. 12/13/2005 10,521miles Brought vehicle to IPAC for recall notice.

"I purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2004 from Chesterfield Dodge located in Midlothian Virginia.  I have owned and loved my 1989 and 1995 Jeep Cherokees with limited problems, other than electrical difficulties.  However my used 2000 Grande Cherokee, with less than 35,000 miles proved to be be my financial downfall.  
      I have spent more than four thousand in the past year to compensate for the : Broken passenger window door, malfunctioning rear tail lights, bent rear axil and resulting worn out wheel bearings, Multiple batteries and two alternators, driver side lock malfunctioning, pressure sensor for fuel pressure, and now ACP main computer... another 4-$800 just guessing.  My Jeep only has 95,000 currently.  What a joke.  I will never by another Jeep/Chrysler product!",

"Jeep Accident as Result of Unintended Acceleration:  On June 10, 2008, I drove up my driveway to put my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland in the garage (I have been main driver since vehicle was purchased new and have put it in same bay of garage everyday since purchase; this is the seventh Jeep we have owned, so I am very familiar with driving Jeeps). Electricity was out from a storm so the automatic garage door opener did not operate.  I parked in front of the bay, put the vehicle in park, turned off the engine and opened the garage door manually.  I got back in the vehicle, started the engine, put car in drive and started slowly into the garage.  
      I wanted to reposition the car, so I applied the brakes and was about to put it in reverse when, suddenly, the engine revved and the car shot forward like a torpedo.  I had my foot plastered on the brake but the car would not stop and plowed into a garden tractor at the back of the garage.  I tried to put it in park to stop it, but with the engine still revving, the car shot backwards out of the garage, across 37 feet of driveway, climbed over a low stone wall and went another 2 feet before slamming into the fieldstone bay window of our house, finally stopping.  All this happened within seconds.  The brakes would not stop the car in either direction, and it accelerated at a frightening speed, under its own power.    My husband got in the vehicle to move it away from the house, using the emergency brake to stop it.  He said the brakes were very spongy and close to the floor.  The next morning, pedal pressure was better and by two days later, the pedal pressure had improved even more.When the car shot forward, it totally destroyed a John Deere tractor, cracked the back cinder block wall of the garage in several places--both inside block and outside stucco, destroyed other property and caused over $2,000 in damages to another vehicle parked in the garage. When it crashed backwards, it bent the garage door channel, destroyed landscaping, hit the house so hard that it bowed the fieldstone front of the house, split drywall and bent it in, damaged studs, etc.  The Jeep has been totaled by the insurance company.  Other structural and property damages are still being computed but are well in excess of $20,000.  I had a sore neck and shoulder for about a week but physically am OK now.  Emotionally, I was a wreck over the incident because I had no control over the car and did nothing to cause the accident.  Repairs are going to cause extensive disruption since the damage is to my home office from which I work. I am concerned that these damages will cause our auto and homeowners premiums to rise when it was vehicle failure that caused the accident and Chrysler is not acknowleding any responsibility.",
"This is the 2nd jeep that I have owned. My 1st was a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I did buy used and I drove it up until March 2008, with little or no service problems, so when I went to go get another vehicle I decided to go with a Jeep again. They seem to hold up and this would be another great investment, plus I was buying a used vehicle that still was under warranty. I purchased a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, from a Jeep Dealership, with 62,000 mi. Since March I have had to have 2 out of the 4 oxygen sensor replaced and throttle positioning sensor replaced with in my 1st 30 days of ownership, since then I have lost the heat in the vehicle and that is going to cost me $1100 to replace,(not covered under the warranty) and an emissions problem that is going to cost $150 to repair, also no covered under warranty. 
      Now my drivers side window regulator had to be replaced and we just replaced today and no sooner than we put the drivers door back together the passengers side regulator is out.These problems just come out of no where, one day the window works fine, the next day it doesn't, one day you have heat, the next day you don't. I have researched these problems and it doesn't seem that I am alone. With so many of Jeep owners having these same issues, I do not understand why there isn't some sort of recall. It seems on this vehicle that once I make one repair something else immediately goes wrong. I feel that I have purchased a vehicle that is going to cost me more in repairs that the value of the vehicle alone. I am very disappointed in Jeep and if this is the quality of vehicle they are going to produce I will not longer be purchasing vehicles from Chrysler.",
"In the past 9 months I've had to replace two window regulator assemblies on my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I live in Washington state and the first time it happened was at the end of October. I was returning home when I heard a pop from the passenger side. Then the window slowly started to lower and didn't stop until it was fully down. It was very rainy at the time and I had to drive to the repair shop with plastic taped over my window, not very safe. 
      The second time was last week driving down a road at 45mph. I was startled when I heard two loud pops from the driver's side and the window started to drop. It didn't stop until it was completely down as well.Each repair has cost me a little over $550 apiece.",
I have replaced two broken windows with a month. You shut the doors and the windows fall down. It is the window regulators. My sister also has had to replace two windows in her 2002 jeep grand cherokee. We both bought them the same day from Whitten Brothers. There is defect in these jeeps. On the internet there are numerous complaints about this very same thing and nothing is being done about it. I asked Whitten Brothers if they could do anything to help with cost and they said no. I have complained to Chyrsler and tried to contact Bobby S. the Service Manager but he would not return calls. Very poor customer service.,
"We had a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with approximately 38,000 miles until it was destroyed by fire last week. We have had constant transmission problems with the car since new. The transmission was replaced at approximately 7,000 miles. Even after the new transmission, the car was back at the Jeep Dealer 9 to 10 times with the same transmission problems. Always getting the run around from the dealer saying the car is fixed, only to be back in short order for the same thing. Never even had a loaner for us. In fact twice in the last 6 weeks leading up to the fire. Luckily a police officer was directly behind the car when the fire started and witnessed the whole thing. the policeman stated that he thought the transmission fluid leaked onto the exhaust and that's what caused the car to burn. Went on to say the fire was into the engine compartment and the passenger compartment in 90 seconds. 
      Prior to the fire, Chrysler refused giving us a replacement, buyout or even another new transmission. Now, Chrysler Customer Claims Resolution Group has advised us they have found no indication of a manufacturing defect that caused the accident. The car never towed anything and was never off road. This vehicle was equipped with the 5.7 Hemi and a QuadraDrive II transmission. Obviously a new vehicle shouldn't have reoccurring transmission problems and certainly shouldn't start on fire.",
"My complaint is more of a concern. I have a '04 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. About 2 years ago the passenger window just slid into the door. I took it to Jeep and they said it would cost about $500. to be fixed. Well, I haven't that kind of money to repair it and have been putting cardboard and such to keep window up, till I have money. But a friend of mind was kind enough to look at it today and found the cable wire had been broken. 
      He finally found one to replace it, put it in and the window motor broke that too. I just happened to go on line today to check out possiblities of how to fix and ran into the website:forums.automotive.com/70/16389/general-auto-repair/2001-jeep-grand-cherokee-power-windows-defect/page10.html - 78k, which told of all these other people and the Jeep window problems they too have encountered. So now my worry is, even if I get my window fixed by installing a regulator that the others too will break and that they will only work for up to 15 months anyway. I would rather have manual windows than deal with this. And I cant afford this anyway. Can't Jeep/Chrysler do a recall and fix this problem. I constantly worry about theft and rain damage, etc.. And my air conditioner won't work correctly either with this on going problem.",
"I took my 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee in for an AC repair. I had a small leak in one of the seals and this was confirmed by a mechanic at the dealer. I was advised that they would replace the seals and I would be on my way. I was called at about 10am and was told that it was complete and was ready to pick up. I picked it up at 6 pm that evening and wanted to try my Air Conditioner. It didn't work at all...the entire refrigerant system was empty. I left the vehicle there and talked to them the next day and was told that all of a sudden my Evaporator has a leak. This went from a relatively minor repair to a really expensive one. I advised them that this wasn't a problem before they serviced it and at the very least they should give me a break on the repair...they offered to take $30 off the total bill. 
      That is less than 5% and doesn't even cover the tax. I took the vehicle to a local Midas and had it looked at by a trusted mechanic that was going to replace the evaporator for me...and he advised that he doesn't want to do it because there are numerous other leaks that they detected and he doesn't want to make the issue any worse. I called the dealer again and talked to the service manager and was told the same line as the day prior that they won't help any more with the repair cost and that they had nothing to do with the malfunction...it was already bad before they touched it. The AC was blowing cold when I originally dropped it off and is now inoperable..",
"2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee- Electrical problems. I purchased my car in '06 used with 12k miles. Less than a year later, I was having electrical problems. All dash indicator lights will come on and flash. Headlights turn on and off. Instrument gauges turn off and then back on.. very scary when driving. Taken to dealership 3 times now.. spent over $600 to replace the wiring harness and it's still not fixed. the dealership is treating me poorly. Telling me it's impossible to diagnosis any electrical issue, but 2 weeks ago had no problem telling me it was for sure the wiring harness. I'm getting the run a round.. and treated so poorly.. They have my car today and are telling me that it's impossible for them to find the problem. How can that be?? This is a safety issue. When this happens my lights won't work and neither do my turn signals, my gauges don't work. It's dangerous to drive- but they don't care ...",
"I was part of the heated seat recall for 2003-2004 jeep grand Cherokees.  I had mine replaced and about an hour later the passenger seat of my 2004 jeep grand Cherokee caught fire.  I have a fire report stated electrical started the fire from deep within the seat.  Chrysler came down to investigate and said it was the heated element that caused the fire.  I am not getting any help with this situation from Chrysler, my insurance will not cover this due too it being Chrysler's fault.  I am having bad experience with customer care at Chrysler I am being extremely patient and very nice to them considering what has happened.  The customer care rep that I have talked too stated that there was no one higher than him that I would be allowed to talk to.  I am also having troubles finding a lawyer because no one got injured during the fire.  Thanks",
"I always wanted a jeep cherokee as a kid...be careful what you wish for!!   I over payed for my 2001 jeep grand Cherokee limited at bererra jeep, for starters {my fault}.      Not long after both window regulators and rear door actuator failed. My big problem with this is that Jeep is fully aware of these problems but does nothing to fix them. About a year after that both front infinity factory speakers blew within a month of each other. Again another problem that jeep is fully aware of and refuses to address...there are no crossovers built into the speakers guys!!??...The poorly built jeep front ends gobble up tires even if you religiously rotate them every three thousand miles. The rotors must be replaced every three years ,{they are built paper thin}.
      My electric fan has failed at 65,000 miles along with the relay switch and thermostat, a seven hundred dollar repair job.

How many Jeep owners out there have cold air blasting in the winter on the passenger side!!!.....i know I am one of them, it almost cost me a couple of relationships..lol.     Now at 70,000 miles my transmission pan is rotting away and leaking tranny fluid. i go back to the dealer on Monday so I will keep you posted.",
My 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee has had the front passenger window regulator as well as the rear window regulator break - $800 to repair! The electric windows malfunction and this can be a dangerous situation if you need to roll your window down and it doesn't work. I discovered through web research that this has been a big problem with Jeep Grande Cherokee cars.,
"My 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo has stalled on numerous occasions under various driving conditions. This last time was on a highway without a shoulder to pull over and semis traveling at high speeds zipping by. I have brought it into the dealer on 3 separate occasions and they have not been able to find/fix the problem. I went on the internet and see that this is not a single isolated case so I am wondering why they act like they know nothing? Also, what are they going to do about it?",
"I was completely stopped at a 4-way stop sign when my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee's engine revved/idled high & it lurched forward. I was practically standing on the brake pedal, but it continued to lurch forward a 2nd time & then a 3rd time until it hit the van in front of me. Since I am certain my foot was firmly and solidly on the brake pedal, I am also certain that I was not pushing the accelerator pedal simultaneously. Now I will have to deal with the ramifications of the accident, including paying for the damages to the van & my insurance premiums rising, even though I was not at fault -- my Jeep was!!! AGGGHHHH!!!
      I hit the van in front of me causing damage to its tail gate/lift panel, as well as its bumper. My insurance premiums will rise, even though I did not make a mistake/driver error!",
"I bought a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo because of the reliability and the weather here in NY.  My husband and I had looked at many different kinds and drove a few before coming to a conclusion of buying the Grand Cherokee Laredo.  We bought the vehicle in Feb. 2007 and have had it in the shop numerous times.  The first instance was the engine light came on while driving down the highway right in the middle of the city.  I immediately called the dealership and took it in.  Apparently the O2 Sensor had gone out on it (only 23,000 miles on it) and they replaced it.  Within a couple of months I had to put it back in the shop for another problem and when I got it back the windshield washer fluid wasn't coming out.  I figured that they didn't hook something back up right.  
      Again, it went back in the shop.  Then, after thinking that everything should be fine, I was on my way to my mother's (4 hour drive away) for Christmas in some not so good weather, I was driving along with the cruise control on at 70mph.  All of a sudden the vehicle accelerated and I just thought it was because we were going up a hill.  I looked down and I was doing 90mph and staying there.  I disengaged the cruise control and turned it off.  I waited awhile and turned it back on and set the speed that I wanted to go.  As soon as I set the speed it accelerated and went back up to 90mph again.  I turned off the cruise control and drove the remaining of the trip in fear that if I used the cruise control it would do the same thing and I had my family in the car with me.  On the way home a couple of days later (not running the vehicle) I set the cruise control again and it did the same thing.  The next day I took it back into the shop and told them the problem I was having along with now the cruise control wouldn't even come on.  After about a week of driving a loaner they told me that it was ready and that the powertrain module and blown on it and they replaced it.  After driving it again for about 2 months it started doing it again.  I took it in again and after about a week they told me that it was a bad batch of powertrain modules and that they replaced it again.  I brushed this off as a case of a bad batch from the factory, but after getting it back we used it twice and within the 2 week period the vehicle again did the same thing.  This time my husband and I were getting upset that this was happening again.  I took the vehicle into the shop again and after a week of trying to figure out what the problem was they called and stated that they were going to have to call and get the factory rep to come out and figure out what the problem was because when they hooked it up to the machine for diagnosis it came up with nothing.  I had to have my vehicle back because we were going camping and towing a popup camper behind and couldn't do it with a rental.  After about another week the dealership called me and asked me to bring the vehicle back in because the rep had asked them to do a couple of test on it.  I brought it back in and they kept it for a day or two.  I got a call from the service manager stating that they had finally found the problem, which happened to be a wiring problem, but they had to put in another powertrain module and they were on backorder with the factory and one could not be found anywhere else.  At this time I am getting upset with the fact that this could not have been found earlier.  The other thing that upsets me is that my family rides in the car with me and the thought that this could be a very dangerous situation.  Do I trust the theory of some bad wiring or is this a common problem in a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo?",
We purchased a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee brand new at the 5* dealership. Since we have owned it we have replaced the brakes 4 times. Have had to have the two front windows fixed to a tune of 1100.00. There was also an additional problem that was fixed at the dealership to the tune of 300.00 and right now it sits at a shop with 600.00 worth of repairs. We will never even look at a Jeep/Chrysler product. They are junk! We just purchased a Mitsubishi Lancer and bought the extended warranty. Hopefully we will have better luck with the new car.,
"I bought a used 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee through an auto buying organization where I work. I was not given the time to run an Autofax on the vehicle, but told someone else was going to take it if I did not make an immediate decision. I bought the vehicle and shortly thereafter noticed there was a vibration every time I stepped on the brake pedal. About the same time I received notification of a settlement in a class action lawsuit in New Jersey telling me I could take my car to a dealership for a brake inspect and replacement of rotors and other parts if needed. I took the car to the Go dealership on So. 
      Broadway in Littleton, and it was determined the front rotors were warped. They replaced them free of charge. Naive me, I really thought the problems would stop there. 6 months later and less than 6,000 miles it started all over again, so back I went, where a second set of front rotors were replaced free of charge. At this time,I was told the back brakes were getting mighty thin and would soon need replacement. I left, and within 2 months and less than 5,000 miles later, an intense vibration started every time I would depress the brake pedal. There was a loud creaking door sound every time I would press the pedal also. So, back I went to the dealership again, where they discovered that both the front and back rotors were warped. They replaced the front ones for free again, but I spent $400.00 to have the back ones replaced.  Now, although the dealership has been generous in replacement of these brakes, this only tells me there is a continuing problem with brakes on these cars. I was told there were no technical service bulletins or recalls on these vehicles, but isn't it strange ther have been lawsuits?  I hold total sympathy with some of the above comments about these vehicles. This is an unsafe vehicle that is nothing more than a death trap on wheels. I am afraid to drive this car above 50 miles an hour. When I called Jeep to make a complaint, I was sent to India,and assured someone would be in contact with me. That was three weeks ago. When I called the manager at Go Jeep/Chrysler, I was told a District Manager would call me. That was 2 weeks ago.  I think it's about time to start another class action against Jeep. I really believe they are manufacturing faulty vehicles and trying to cover up the fact with smiles and free replacement parts. As it now stands, I have replaced the brakes on this car 3 times in less than 20,000 miles of ownership. It currently has 41,000 miles on it, and I own a car I am afraid to drive to the corner store.",
"I have owned my 2000 Grand Cherokee for over 6 years. The brakes have been replaced 3 times since, mainly front rotors that warp. I have had a water pump go bad, and a radiator. Now I am dealing with the notorious Death Wobble at speeds of 40-55mhp my jeep shakes so bad you can hardly hold the steering wheel. I just had new brakes put on ans had the techs look into it and they could not find anything. Now I have to locate a jeep dealership to over charge me for a bad part. Needless to say, its 8 years old, only has 80K miles, but its getting traded in for a different make and model. Very unhappy that no one knows why these shake so bad?!",
"Today when I went to the carwash that I have frequented for the eleven years that I have owned my 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, I was refused service.  They sited unintended sudden acceleration in all makes of Jeeps.  After getting on the internet & doing just a short search, I have found numerous reports from consumers on problems of this nature for all years from as early as 1996 to 2007.  Never once has Chrysler notified me regarding a problem of this nature.  I was not aware of this until today! How can this be!!!! Is this acceptable? I have noticed a problem with my transmission lately, & have had it in to be serviced.  It still seems to have a problem, however. I am very nervous about driving this vehicle now!

"I have a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. I have had several problems with the radiator cooling fan relay. I had to replace this part about five times costing me a bout $350.00 (because I take to my won mechanic, otherwise...) each time it has to be replaced. This relay is located in a very difficult place to get to, so the mechanics have have to take a great deal of parts off to get to this relay. This last time the mechanic informed me that in order to avoid replacing the relay so many times I had to replace the radiator cooling fan control module which cost me $692.29. I have spoken to other jeep owners and seems like that everyone has the same problem plus other problems that I have not encountered yet. 
      I contacted Jeep customer assistance center and they say they are not responsible for this. I have spoken to the mechanic that fixes my jeep and he has had several customer with the same problem. My mechanic has used jeep parts to avoid any complaints from myself or Chrysler. I'm very disappointed with the Jeep and Chrysler itself. This is by far the worst automobile I ever had, and I've owned several. It looks good in the outside, but the inside (motor, noise, etc.) are the worst. I want Jeep Chrysler to come out and to be responsible for so much damage to their customers. I will never buy a Chrysler vehicle ever again.",
"I own a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Larado with power windows. I have put 40k miles on my jeep and have had 3 window regulators go out in that time span. 2 on the RF door and now 1 on the RL door. I have never had a vehicle with so much window problems. I know that this jeep is out of warranty, but I see on the internet that I am not alone and believe that Jeep/Chysler should make a better window regulator. This leaves your jeep open to easier access and maybe even theft. I have made a complaint to Jeep asking that they warranty the last regulator that has broken which I have temporarly held together with vice grips.",
"Brought my 04 Jeep Grand Cherokee in for service. Got a call from service manager-he told me, among many other things, that my rear breaks were gone. Not only were the pads done (he gave me the measurement) but also my rotors were completely shot. It would be $700.00 to fix the breaks.  I responded by telling him I JUST HAD my rear breaks done. He acted surprised. I told him not to touch them.  I happened to be a block away so I stopped in. I asked to see my car.  We walked back and the mechanic nervously grabbed the rotor and pointing to it he said, see its gone.  I looked at it and told him I am not supid there is nothing wrong with the rotor. He agreed.  Then I pointed to the BRAND NEW PADS and said and there is nothing wrong with those either.",
"I too have been having stalling problems with my 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. I am scared to drive on the highway because it sputters and stalls suddenly. The problem has not been found. We have replaced the fuel pump, but the problem continues. This recall should be including older models as well as the newer ones. The danger is all the same regardless of the year the Jeep was made. Chrysler should do something about all of the stalling problems. By searching online, I found that Dozens of people have the same problem with their Jeep. Too many people have had the same thing happen while driving- Thank you.",
"Jeep grand cherokee 2000 stalls for no reason. I can be traveling 65 mph or less or sitting in the drive thru. When it stalls, all power is lost & power steering. Very dangerous as I drive in heavy traffic. Very afraid to get behing the wheel.",
"My 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee accelerated on its own at a high rate of speed totalling 3 vehicles and damaging 1 other and with the grace of God, not one of the 10 people got injured seriously or killed as the brakes were not able to stop the vehicle in a four-way intersection",
"I drove my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited to work, where I park in a parking structure. As I pulled into my space, I had my foot on the brake and my hand on the stick to put it in park. Suddenly the jeep accelerated and hit the cement wall in front of me hard enough to have it bounce back and hit again. I hit the brakes repeatedly and hard to no avail. It sounded as if I was in park with my foot on the accelerator. Then it finally stopped. $6200 dollars in damage later. The whole right front end was a smashed up gapping whole. It looked like I was in a head on collision. The kicker, the air bag never went off!!!! Fortunately, I was not injured, and neither was anyone else. I drive this vehichle on a daily basis with my 2 yr old son! I am seriously considering getting rid of this vehichle.",
"My 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee's rear passenger-side window regulator broke.  A new one was installed when I bought it one year ago (10 months ago actually).  The part was $250!!  It had to come from the dealership.  This happens to many, many Jeep Cherokee owners.  If their window regulators don't last, they should help pay for repairs even after warantees expire.",
"I owned a used 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee, used because it was my parents car for two years until I bought it off of them. I was also work as a service advisor for Chrysler - Jeep dealership, and used to deal with at least 3-5 people a day, bringing in their vehicles for warped front brake rotors. I had to replace my rotors on my Jeep 4 times in two year and a half years that I owned it, the last time going with an after market product that seemed to solve the problem. I was contacted as part of a class action law suit against Chrysler for the brake rotor problems. I chose not to participate in it, because it was going against my former employer. When I got rid of it, I went to a Dodge Ram 1500, I specifically asked the sales person, a mechanic, and the finance guy if this Chrysler vehicle had problems with their brakes, to which they all answered a confirming No. So after having the truck for 7 months, I had the front rotors replaced at 7K miles, again at 15K miles. at that time, the dealership said that in order to have it covered under warranty, I would have to pay a $50 co-payment, which I did, and they said it would carry a warranty up until 36K miles. so when the brakes started to go again at 24K miles, I decided to deal with the shake and shimmy until it got closer to 36K miles. 
      Well, that Dodge dealership closed, with no warning signs or anything. I took it to a Chrysler dealership in the same town, who said that it would cost me $92 to even look at the brakes and that they weren't covered under warranty!!  I told them to forget it. I emailed Chrysler directly, in which the girl that replied could not have been more rude and ignorant, even calling me the wrong name, not just once, but then again even after I corrected her the first time!!  She told me that I was basically out of luck because that $50 co-payment was with the dealership and not with them. So now, I am stuck with a POS Chrysler product, yet again, I was lied to, taken advantage of, robbed, and with no help from the manufacturer to stand behind their product. I was looking to go back and purchase another Jeep product, but that one girl from Chrysler turned me off on their product all together! It is even to the point now where she is not even responding back to me!",
"I simply wish to echo the complaints of Jeep owners whose vehicles are stalling. My 2005 Grand Cherokee with the 4.7L engine intermittently stalls while braking, coasting, and/or turning. It began a few months after I bought it new and has happened 15-20 times in 2 years. The sudden loss of power steering and power brakes, particularly in the middle of a turn in traffic, can be extremely hazardous to the people in my Jeep and anyone around us.  I am unable to reproduce the stalling at will, which means a mechanic has never witnessed it. Since it does not store any codes when this occurs, the dealer hasn't been willing to do any troubleshooting. They just give it back to me assuming there's nothing wrong with it.  Eventually, after multiple complaints and visits to the dealer, they attached their Co-Pilot to it, which supposedly monitors all of the vehicles electrical functions. Why this wasn't done initially, I don't know.  
      I was able to capture two stalls over the course of one week using this device. They could then confirm that it was indeed stalling. Previously all I had was my word with no evidence to back it up. The dealer replaced the EGR valve and purge solenoid, under Chrysler's direction, based on the information from the Co-Pilot. A week later it stalled again. Yesterday Chrysler recommended they replace the ignition module, which they did, because they've seen some cause problems. It is now in testing mode again, with me as the guinea pig, waiting for a stall that finally causes an accident. This vehicle is unsafe and unreliable, and it should be repurchased by Chrysler under the Ohio Lemon Law.  Unfortunately, all I have received on that front is resistance.  Communication with Chrysler is difficult at best - at worst, impossible.  They refuse to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and seem to be waiting for someone to die before they take any action.  Further, anyone of any authority is completely firewalled by their customer service department.  I don't know any of the information I've sent them has ever gotten beyond my file.  Both the dealer and Chrysler claim they have never heard of the symptoms I'm reporting, yet I can go out on the Internet and in 30 seconds find hundreds of stalling complaints from Jeepforum.com, NHTSA, Usenet news, and a host of other sites about Grand Cherokees, Commanders, and Wranglers, between 2004 and 2008, with the Hemi engine, the 4.7L, and the CRD.  Many of these complaints are eerily similar to mine:  Jeep intermittently stalls while slowing down, the dealer can't find any codes or reproduce the problem themselves, and they send it home where it continues to stall.  I have sent copies of these complaints to Chrysler and to the dealer. The dealer's owner tells me they are investigating further, based on those other complaints, but I really don't expect much result. The dealer tells me Chrysler won't let them do any further troubleshooting (beyond driving it to see if it stalls) because they can't find any codes.  It seems to me, if there's a code registered, that means something the engineers predicted could fail has failed; and if something breaks in a way no one has ever thought of before, there is no way for the computer to know it broke.  Before the ignition swap, I had written off ever driving it again.  It is unsafe and I am not comfortable tooling around in a vehicle that I know could hurt someone by no fault of them or me.  To be as fair as I possibly can be, though, I will drive it again and see if it still stalls, now that another component has been replaced. I do not believe it is my responsibility to test it, but since no one else seems to be able to witness a stall, I have no choice.  If it stalls again, now that they have replaced three components per Chrysler's instructions, it will solidify my Lemon case and only work in my favor - that is, unless the next stall is the deadly one. I just have to be especially careful every time I coast, brake, or make a turn.",
"I purchase a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee and also purchase the extended warranty coverage for $1800 good for 7 yrs/100,000 miles.  Less than 2 ears after purchasing the vehicle (~50K miles), the heat stopped working on the passenger side.  The dealership told me that they needed to update the software in the HVAC module to fix the heat and that this was not a covered item.  Additionally, the vehicle has stalled several times when braking (5-6 times) since I have owned it.  I have taken it into the shop for this issue several times and then it recurs.  I am concerned because it is a potential SAFETY issue if it stalls in the middle of heavy traffic.  I would like to know if there is an investigation of the engines in the 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee models.",
"A couple of months ago, I was driving my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee, when it suddenly and violently accelerated, causing me do swerve, dodge and weave, not to hit anything, until I could gain control of the vehicle.  The Electronic Throttle Control light was on, while the episode happened.  After having the vehicle towed to the dealer, they couldn't find anything wrong with the car.  The vehicle had about 5000 miles on it at the time.  I refuse to put my children in the car, and after telling that to the man in the service department, he stated that he didn't think the problem would happen again.  Not very reassuring.  I recently wrote a email to Jeep Corporate, with much of the same information I'm writing here, and they said to go to another dealership.  Such crap.  I know of 2 other people in my area that have had similar issues with their Jeep.  Something is wrong here, and I don't know what to do.  I could use the help.  Thank you.",
"I have a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee that I've enjoyed very much.  However, I am experiencing no heat on the passenger side of the vehicle.  Thanks to the internet, I've discovered that this is a very common problem with the early 2000 models.  Having owned several cars before this, I am sure that this should not be happening to a car that is only 5 years old.  Mechanics are quoting about $800 to repair this problem.  I am also being told that this will probably happen soon to the other side of the vehicle.    
      This is the second major problem that has occurred with my Grand Cherokee, the first being that the front differential had to be replaced at 70K miles.  Since I do only normal highway miles and do not mistreat the vehicle, I was told that this should not have happened.    I wonder how many complaints of this sort you have had and if anything can be done about it.  It is a very expensive repair to have to pay for when it is something that should not be breaking down.  HELP!",
"I have owned my Jeep Grand Cherokee for 1 year, I noticed a few weeks ago that I could hear a wind noise coming through the door. It was a windy day so I didn't think anything about it. But, as days passed, I also noticed that there was a gap between the door and the console. So I made an appointment with my Jeep dealership. After having the car from 9-5 they called an said that it was my fault. That I had opened the door too hard. That I actually pulled the door away from the hinges. Long story short. That is Not a factory default. I guess the car door is supposed to fall off after being opened. I am not impressed with the service or my warranty. I am looking into legal action at this time.",
"I own a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo with 65,000 miles. In November 2007, while parked in the driveway, my drivers side window fell. My independent mechanic diagnosed the problem as a result of a defective window regulator. Cost=$400. Now in January 2008, the same thing happened to my passenger window. The cost for this window repair, another $400. How ironic. Total cost to replace window regulators in two month is now at $800!! This is absolutely ridiculous. After reading hundreds of complaints on this website and others, a class action lawsuit against Chrysler and/or the regulator manufacturer is definitely in order here. I would hate for any passenger's or children to get injured as a result of this.",
"After owning my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited for 2 weeks, the first thing that happened was that my battery instantly without explanation died. I replaced the battery but was haunted by the weird things that the Jeep was doing right before the battery died (flickering lights, dials going wild) The next, more serious event, happened about three days later. I was driving down the road and the vehicles in front of me were slowing to turn. I slowed and then when I accelerated, the gas pedal depressed on its own and I was unable to slow the jeep with the brakes. I thought that maybe I had accidently activated the cruise and turned it on and off a couple of times. As the Jeep accelerated past 65 and braking was not effective, I had to pass a car that I had come up behind (no one was coming the other direction or this would have been the end of the line for me). 
      I tried to press the gas pedal thinking that it might be stuck. This only made the Jeep accelerate even more as it kicked it into the passing mode. No one was in front of me at this point, but there was an extremely busy intersection about 1/2 a mile ahead. Instantly, just when I was about to fully panic and start praying for my kids to be taken care of when I was gone, the Jeep stopped. I pulled off the side of the road and turned off the ignition. I let it sit for a few minutes while I composed myself and then turned it on and pulled back out onto the roadway. I drove at 20 mph for the next 5 miles to work and called the salesman to come and get it. He could tell by my voice that it was serious. He brought me a loaner car and came to get the Jeep. The maintenance department replaced an air hose and lubricated the throttle and asked me when I could come to pick it up. I was terrified to even get inside the Jeep. I'm not sure yet what I can do about it legally, but am looking into whether I can make them take it back. I cannot drive the vehicle or even worse put my children in the vehicle. I cannot believe that there has not been a recall with as many reports as I've found on this specific issue on the internet. This is ridiculous!!",
I purchased my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Special Edition used this past February and since then I have both rear regulator/motors go out on my windows. The first window was repaired at over $300.00 the second window came down on Christmas Day and has not been repaired yet due to money problems. At the time I purchased the vehicle I also purchased an extended warranty which does not cover this issue. After looking into this problem on the internet I have found out that a lot of people with Jeep vehicles are having the same problem and that Chrysler will do nothing about it. The least they can do is have a recall on the regulator/motor and put better made parts in there vehicles. I also have an 80's model Ford Taurus that I have had since I was 16 years old and have never had to replace this part. What do we as the buyers have to do to get quality vehicles for our money.,
"I own a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. While idling, with me foot on the brake and my shift in drive, the car accelerates by itself. I have taken it to a jeep dealer twice, spending $1300 total, then an aamco spending $1020 and I am still having this problem. I just got the car out of the aamco shop yesterday and the car is now accelerating and then shutting off. Can anyone help me with this problem?",
got in my 2004 grand Cherokee after leaving restaurant on December 21st and turned on car seats. within 2 minutes i thought i smelled wiring burning. all of a sudden my butt got very hot in one spot and i realized the seat was on fire. it had burned through the seat and looked like a cigarette burn. it had come through the leather seat. i immediately turned the seat heater off and it continued to smolder. odor was more like fabric burning rather than electrical. it took the rest of the evening for the smell to go away.shocked when looked up on google. never received recall notice even though i bought from jeep dealer. it was less than a year old at purchase and i have had jeep for almost 3 years and serviced only there.,
"i bought a 2002 grand Cherokee in 2005. about 2 months after i bought it, a check engine light came on. i took it to a neighborhood friend who specialized in transmission work. turns out it was coolant caps had rusted through. apparently the owner before me didn't used antifreeze, but water and the caps rusted through. after that $500, i had not problems until about a week ago. i went down the street and when i returned and shut the door the window fell to the bottom of the door. i frantically went to the internet to see what may have happened. i read the different sites that people had reported the same symptoms that i had(i counted 102 occurrences on one site). 
      i emailed Daimler Chrysler to ask them what could have happened. i have not received an email back. i replaced the window regulator like everyone i read about did. i was a jeep fan until this happened and read all the different problems other people have experienced and the horrible customer service they display. i am constantly living with the fear that i will be driving somewhere in a severe downpour one day or in subzero temps and will have the luck of dropping another window like most other people i have read about. i will never ever buy another Daimler Chrysler vehicle again, never.",
"I purchased a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo in 2004 with 44K miles. I keep it in very good condition. At about 75K miles, my driver's side window feel into the door in the middle of the night by itself. Apparently, the window regulator broke which costs $500 to repair at the dealership. I had it replaced by a 3rd party for around $300. 2 weeks ago my passenger side door did the same thing while parked in a parking lot. I came back to the car and the window had fallen into the door. THis time I went to the dealer and had it fixed for $500. When I asked if this was a major issue that they saw a lot, he said it happened from time-to-time, but seemed to shrug it off like it wasn't an epidemic or anything. Then, yesterday, I was shutting my back driver's side door and...guess what? You got it...the window fell down into the door.  After reading the incidents on this site and others, I now know that this is truly an epidemic that happens to thousands of Jeep Grand Cherokees somewhere between 50K and 80K miles. From what I've read, it seems like once it starts it is only a short time until each of the others start failing. What is this? And, am I the only person that feels like these faulty parts should be recalled?

"I own a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The window regulators are faulty in the front and in the rear. My rear driver's side regulator broke sometime on the road yesterday and fell down even with the windows locked. I am lucky the kids that were in the backseat did not put their limbs or head, if not entire body, out the window. Jeep has known about this safety hazard and problem for the last 5 years and they have yet to fix the plastic piece that keeps breaking. I am prepared to file a class action lawsuit against the company for the permanent repair and replacement of the rear window regulators since it is a safety hazard for children.",
"I bought our 04' Jeep Grand Cherokee. The vehicle has 51000 miles on it.  The steering valve is faulty, the brake rotors are warped and the AWD transfer case is gone.  Chrysler does not cover any brake components so I'm out $1200.  The steering and transfer case are covered by the warranty. Yet, the transfer case is on National Backorder. Eposti Jeep has been bought by McConnell Jeep and they have no idea when a transfer case will be available.  I made calls to Chrysler Extended warranty and to the Chrysler Service line and was told that there was nothing they could do.  I never experienced service issues like this with my prior Hondas or Toyotas",
"I purchased my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited used from the local Jeep Dealer in my area 9 months ago.  I have put about 5000 miles on it since purchase (March 2007). All was well until 2 weeks ago when the driver's side window fell without warning while parked in a shopping center parking lot.  At first, we thought the car had been broken into, but no sign of entry.  We were unable to pull the window up more than half-way.  
      The motor was still operational, as the window would power down, but not go up.  I contacted the dealership (who had also sold me a brand-new PT Cruiser a while back).  The service manager admitted to me that they are seeing a lot of Jeep window problems, and that they would contact me later that day to see if they would assist in the repair.  They phoned me that afternoon to say that because the vehicle is out of warranty, they would be unable to assist me financially in the repair, which would cost about $400.  I have also researched this problem on the internet and have been dismayed to find HUNDREDS of reports of window failures like mine.  I contacted Chrysler Customer Service in Detroit, and they were unwilling to assist with the cost of repair, or even acknowledge any responsibility for defective parts (I have a 20-year old Ford truck, and nothing like that has ever happened to any of its windows).  I have found a replacement regulator/motor from an independent vendor, which claims to have re-engineered the part and carries a lifetime replacement warranty.  Tomorrow, my trusted local mechanic will be doing the installation.  The Jeep Dealership has lost my business, and so has Chrysler Motors, except for extended warranty work on the PT Cruiser, if any is needed before the warranty expires.  No more Chrysler products for me.  They KNOW they have a problem with these window regulators, and they refuse to issue a recall, because they're making a fortune in service repairs.  My local mechanic said he fixes 2 Jeep windows per week at his shop - all late model years.  He said one of his customers had 3 windows drop in one day, at a cost of $1200 total to repair.  Until someone is injured or killed by this, Chrysler will not recall these.  Take your dollars elsewhere.",
"I purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee with a warranty included from The Eagle Warranty Corporation. A few months later in December work needed to be done to the vehicle. My mechanic wrote up an estimate and contacted the warranty corporation. Shawn at Eagle Warranty approved the work, so my mechanic did the work for me. In completion to the work my bill was $538.88. The claim was made on January 3, 2007. This included caliper, boots, oil change to replace gasket, rear transmission seal, shocks, pads, rotors and labor. When bill was submitted the warranty would only cover $138.99. I paid my mechanic in full because the Eagle Warranty did not send me any money back for the work. 
      I continuously called and left messages for a man by the name of Bryan in the Claims Department. I received one phone message from him to return which I did. I repeatedly called him asking for reimbursement. The final time I called I left a message to call me immediately because I will no longer wait around and I may pursue this issue legally if I am forced to. My call was returned within the half hour. He argued with me stating there was not any paperwork submitted and he would not repay me. I insisted that copies of my invoices were sent within the warranty period and I never received anything. Bryan ignored my calls when the warranty was still active and never made payment back to me. He also stated that since the warranty is now expired he will not reimburse me. I told him the claim was made during the active warranty period and he and his company failed to make prompt payment to myself. I want payment as soon as possible.",

"In September I went to a car wash to get my 1999 Jeep grand Cherokee washed. I had the vehicle in Neutral and when the wash was complete I shifted the vehicle to drive and it accelerated on its own to full throttle. I stood on the brakes but could not stop the vehicle. I hit a wall behind the car wash and then bounced into a boat that was being dried . Fortunately the owner of the boat got out of the way and was not hit. I went to the local Jeep dealer and told them what happened. They could not explain nor understand why this happened!!! I now hear that this is something that has happened to many people with Jeeps always, when they're shifted from neutral to drive.",
"A month after purchasing our new Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2002, the driver side window fell to the bottom of the door.  We took the Jeep back to have it repaired.  We waited for a couple of weeks for the part to arrive.  At that point I had actually called about the part and the corporation said the part was already shipped out a week prior to this.  Anyways, the dealership fixed the problem with that window-the regulator.  Then in August we had the same exact window regulator break again.  We had that fixed at another dealership.  Two weeks later we had the front passenger window fall to the bottom of the door as well.  Frustrated, we have contacted the customer service department twice by email and once by phone.  I talked to a customer service representative just yesterday, November 23 and was told there was nothing that could be done seeing that it was out of warranty.  Ironically, we had our rear driver side window regulator break last night.  We have already spent over $400 for one window, and have two windows still broken.  If we pay another $850 we have no guarantee that the problem is fixed.",

I have not had the regulator issue with the windows yet ...guess I am overdue.Also have not had the brake issue.My issue is the with the Jeep Dealers...they just can not handle the multitude of issues with this car. It overwelms them. Replacement of the heater blend doors is a prime example...10 hours to tear apart the dashboard to get to a $200 part is just   bad engineering.

"Barb Palos Heights IL  (11/13/07)I own a 2005 Grand Cherokee. When I bought this car, it had less than five miles on it. Within a month, it began to lurch when I backed out of my driveway.  Then I started getting service four wheel drive icons coming up on my dash.  I took it for service about four weeks after I bought it and was told nothing was wrong with it.  Then it began to stall.  It stalled an hour after I had been driving it,  always when I needed to accelerate into traffic.  Then it started to not start at all.  Nice days, rainy days, didn't matter.  I had to call Road Assist and have it towed into dealership.  
      Each time,  I was told nothing was wrong with it. Finally, one day the dash board went crazy.  All the lights started flashing on and off and the service tone began  to chime constantly. Again (fifth time) I took it to dealer and this time they changed a sensor.  Things improved for a bit but now we are at it again.  The latest is the icons for service engine soon, service four wheel drive system and I believe service air bags come on and blink for awhile then go off.  It's also started to stall when I accelerate in traffic again.  This is the worst made car I have ever had.  It is my third Grand Cherokee and I didn't have this level of trouble with the other two.  I did however, have to replace the brakes on the other two pretty early on. The second Jeep, had a service bulletin for brakes so they were replaced free.  But the first Jeep didn't and I had to pay for it.  The gas mileage on this Jeep is nowhere near what they quote on the Maroni.  I've yet to see 15 mpg with any regularity let alone 20 mpg.  I can honestly say I will NEVER purchase one of these vehicles again. I can't trust this car and that is a major no no in my book.  This one is leased and as soon as that lease is up, it's going back.  Then, I'm heading to a different manufacturer.  Jeep makes nothing but trash.  I have friends who also have newer Grand Cherokees and they too have all sorts of stupid issues with the car.",
Vehicle is a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee. There is a nationwide issue with these vehicles causing electric window lift mechanisms regulators to fail. The result is that the window falls into the door. It happens often when there is no one in the car such that there is a security risk to personal property in the vehicle. Two people had the windows fall in inclement weather and one in a downpour with babies on board.,
I own a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee that has had no major problems but then a couple days ago the passenger window dropped into the door while I was driving. I looked into it a little bit and noticed all that was wrong was a broken cable and a broken plastic gear inside the motor but I couldn't find any parts to repair it so I had to take it in. By talking to the service manager and surfing the web I found out that lots of people are having the same problem but Chrysler is denying that it is a defect so they are not willing to fix it. Well come to find out the dealer cant just repair the parts that are broken(a small metal cable and a plastic wheel valued at about $10 to be generous) They have to replace the whole window regulator because it all comes assembled together in one piece. Nice little scam Chrysler has going on here. I think its fair to say it's a scam due to the fact they will not recall this and fix the problem.,
"My 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee went up in flames in my driveway. The fire dept. determined it was an electrical fire. It had been off for over ten minutes. I had not had any work done on it recently, or added oil to it, nor did I drive it that night more than 5 miles. I found out that there was a recall that could cause engine fires, but Jeep says that that recall did not affect my VIN number. (My VIN is less than 8000 numbers off the recalled 32000). Someone should have them check and make sure that this doesn't happen to another family.",
I own a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee that has had its share of normal problems but then a couple weeks ago the drivers window unexpectedly dropped into the door.  Luckily it wasn't raining or anything and we got home fine.  I did some looking over the door and everything seemed ok and I could hear the motor moving but the window would not come back up.  I figured I would check it out the next day and since it was nice out I wasn't worried.  Later that day the left side passenger window did the exact same thing.  Now I was upset.  I decide to start investigating the issue on the internet and found out that lots of people are having the same problem but Chrysler is denying that it is a defect so they are not willing to fix it.,
"A very common problem in 1999-2004 model Grand Cherokees has been weak blend and re-circulation doors in the HVAC systems, which causes heat to stop working.  My JEEP has this problem and has no heat.  In January of 2004 Jeep issued an informational TSB (#24-001-04) which introduced newly designed sub assemblies to repair the original equipment which has a major design defect.  This is a very common problem and many people are angry about it and JEEP's lack of help with it.",
"2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, Had several issues of stalling during driving. Took to 2 different dealerships and no one could fix the problem. I owned the jeep from new and this happened at least 1 time every two weeks. I have now encountered a new problem of the A/C not working properly. The air only blows on the floor. Even if i turn the heat on the cold air still blows on the floor. I took into dealership and they replaced the a/c head unit and this did not correct the problem. They said they were going to have to replace the entire ac system. I have now gotten rid of this vehicle and unfortunately will never buy another jeep again. Very disappointing.",
"I too, have had problems with my Jeep Grand Cherokee (1999).  When I take my foot of the brake say for instance at a red light that turns green, the Jeep lurches forward for no apparent reason.  If i'm stopped let's say to get gas and turn the Jeep off, when I turn it back on and again, when I put the Jeep in Drive (from Park) it lurches and actually almost burns rubber.  I'm glad I read that I'm not the only one with this problem with Jeep vehicles.",
"I have a 2001 jeep grand cherokee larado and this is the 2nd window regulator that i am having to buy at $300 per window, why cant jeep do something about this? i have read many complaints about this, i will never have another jeep again
      i",
"We own a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Over the course of the last two years we have had to replace every window regulator, currently have leaking gaskets, the electrical system is locking up and has frozen the back entry door and we have had to replace a distributor cap.  This vehicle has been the worst product and the service prices are astronomical.",
"My husband and I purchased a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 2 years ago, and have had nothing but trouble since.  We have had to replace 2 window regulators which costs over $300 per window, and just yesterday the third window regulator broke, and has to be replaced.  Also the electric fan which cools the radiator busted about a year ago and costed us several hundred dollars.  When it broke, I had luckily just pulled up to my home because I heard some funny noises under the hood of the Jeep.  When I put it into park the blade came off and busted a hole through my radiator.  Luckily it came apart before I popped the hood to find out what was wrong.  That could have been NASTY.  Now I'm just wondering whats going to break next.",
I bought a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee and 5 days later the passenger side window fell into the door.  Apparently this is a huge problem but Chrysler will not recall the plastic regulator.,
"i put my 2004 jeep grand Cherokee Laredo into drive and it suddenly accelerated as witness said like a rocket. i was unable to stop it, hitting fences, gas meter and resting in someones living room. major damage. lucky no one was killed. i just bought the car about 2 weeks ago. i was given a ticket but not arrested yet. still under investigation. car has been impounded state police removed the black box and my insurance agent was refused access to the jeep 
      jeep totaled, fence totaled, gas meter busted, house major damage. no injurys",
"I purchased a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee new in Feb. 2005.  I kept the vehicle in the garage for the past two years and left it in the rain for the first time this past week.  It turns out that the drain tubes in the vehicle were plugged.  They were plugged during manufacturing of the vehicle, Chrysler knew of the issue and had issued a technical service bulletin.  However since I have over 36,000 miles on the Jeep they would not cover the $1,000 procedure.  I told them that this was punishing me for taking care of my vehicle and they should make an exception but they would not, even after I pointed out that the Jeep was less than 3 years old (within the time frame of the warranty), the item was not tied to the mileage (it was not a wear item), and there was no way for me to know unless the vehicle was left in the rain (the tubes run between the outer and inner roof).  They didn't care.  After buying 5 new Chrysler vehicles over the last 10 years I will NEVER buy another.  My wife just purchased a new Acura and there is no comparison concerning customer service.  Chrysler treats you like a sucker after purchasing their vehicles, Acura treats you with respect...that is what makes you a repeat customer....Never again Chrysler...Never again.",
"Before purchasing my 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, I owned a Honda Civic for 10 years. I purchased my Jeep new and it's been nothing but a money sink hole ever since. Why can't American car manufacturers figure this out. I will never again by any vehicle made by Jeep or it's affiliates. My Jeep is now 8 years old with 80,000 miles and it has a loud popping/crunching/rattle under the driver's side front end, underneath the brake/left tire area. It's also got a loud roaring sound coming from the back end that sounds like a jet taking off. I've had the driver's window motor replace ($380), gas fuel line blew off ($250), water pump replaced ($225), oil leak repaired ($330), rotars & brakes replaced 4 times and it's vibrating again, right front headlight lens replaced, seatbelt retractor replaced, and the list goes on and on. 
      What a piece of JUNK. When I buy my new vehicle in a couple of months, it will be a TOYOTA or a HONDA. I hate buying another foreign vehicle, but these are the only 2 companies that can make a vehicle that doesn't nickle & dime you to death. Not to mention the decreasing gas mileage. I used to get about 18.5/mpg, now I get about 14/mpg. Oh, the electronic display for the temperature, direction, mpg, etc., it's not working either. I WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER BUY ANOTHER JEEP. If we all would protest and not buy this junk in the future, they'll go out of business!",
"I took my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee to a carwash. As the employee turned the car on to bring it out of the wash and put it in drive, the car accelerated by itself and he dodged people, cars and cleaning materials for 10 seconds before the brakes would work again. We filed a police incident report and my car is at the dealership right now. I will not be driving it again as it is a danger and obviously a lemon.",
"Last week the regulator on my front passenger window went out and it cost $380 to repair.  The mechanic said it is a common problem in the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and similar vehicles.  Eight days later, same problem with the front drivers window...Jeep says too bad and that they won't reimburse my cost.",
"On 9/17/07 the left front wheel broke off of our 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  We were towed to exit 23 where we went to a combination BP/Wendys store.  The tow truck driver and co-owner, Ed Dominick, went inside to ask the manager if it were okay to park our vehicles there.  He said yes.  After we were parked, my husband went inside and talked to the manager to make sure that it was okay and to tell him that we would arrange to have our vehicles removed as soon as we could.  He knew we lived 3.5 hours away and my husband also gave him his name, address and telephone number.  The next day my husband called from home to speak to the manager again as he was worried about our vehicles.  
      That Wednesday, the 19th, friends went to pick up the vehicles but had the wrong kind of towing vehicle.  They told the business they'd be back with the other towing vehicle and went back that Saturday to pick up the vehicles and the manager had them towed on 2pm Friday to Tony's Wrecker Service in Bulls Gap, Tn.  The store location is Bulls Gap, TN.  He gave us no notice that he intended to tow the vehicles and he knew that we were having people come to pick them up, and he had given permission not only to my husband but to the tow truck driver/co-owner.  Now we cannot afford to get our things, the wrecker service refuses to even give us our personal belongings and we have not even been sent notice that they have our vehicles.  Plus the trailer was loaned to us by a friend and is not even ours.  We need some help in getting our things back and we feel that BP should pay.  We have contacted the business owner and as the manager told him that he didn't give us permission, they used that as an excuse to brush us off.  We need to go to court for justice.",
"Well well... I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one... I have a 2003 Jeep Cherokee.  In 2005 I replaced my Pass-window $420.  Last October one of my back windows fell.  I called and was also told by Chrysler customer service that I had to go to the dealership and pay for a diagnosis and then they would decide if they would do anything.  
      So my husband and I fixed it temporally. In March my Transmission went out.  $3000.    In July the other back window fell.  I got online to look for possible recalls for the Jeep windows and instead found a recall for a Torque Converter Drain Back Valve on the transmission.  This part caused the transmission to overheat and damage to the transmission, on 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0 engines.  The Mechanic shop that replaced the transmission said that this was the part that failed and they waited an extra week for the part to arrive. So with 3 out of 4 windows broke and the trans. info I emailed Chrysler customer service.  I was told that my Vin # was not one of the affected recalls.(EVEN THOUGH I HAD THE SAME YEAR MODEL, MODEL, AND ENGINE TYPE AND HAD THE SAME PART FAIL AS STATED IN THE RECALL) and that until I took the Jeep to the dealership nothing could be done about my windows.  Last Monday, My Drivers side window failed, I bit my tongue and took the Jeep to the dealership and it was going to be $257 per part per window and $164 labor per window. About $1,300 total for all 3 windows.  I called Chrysler back and they said we will reimburse $750 BUT I would have to get it replaced there at the dealership and I would have to pay for the amount and submit for reimbursement. It would take up to 2 months for refund.  I asked it there was a time frame on this offer and was told NO I only had to do what was previously stated.  I called back not 10 mins later to ask another question and was told by that person that I had 30 days to have the full amount turned in for me to be able to get ANY reimbursement!",
"On May 26th, 2007 my husband was about to borrow our son's 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland, which incidentally,  we had purchased earlier in the year expecting it to be a safe and reliable car for college. He had just hitched the trailer to the vehicle's tow hook as it as faced down our rather steep driveway situated on the side of a mountain. He got behind the driver's wheel, and I climbed into the front passenger's seat. He placed his foot on the brake, intending to put the vehicle in gear, and once the vehicle was placed in drive, it suddenly accelerated violently forward. 
      He attempted to steer the car to the right where a dirt berm would slow the motion. The vehicle impacted the hillside and rolled onto the top and over onto it's wheels. We were bruised and badly shaken up, but thankfully not seriously hurt. However, had my husband not taken this evasive action, I'm sure our four children would have been orphans by now. Fortunately after the first roll, the trailer got caught in some trees which prevented the car from further rolling further down the driveway and then possibly continuing down the mountain side! Even though the police supported our case with the evidence found, Daimler Chrysler concluded that it was driver error. My husband is a meticulously careful driver with an excellent driving record. We are immensely aware of the caution required on such a steep slope, especially when in the process of towing a trailer, so why on earth would he suddenly accelerate with full force down such a steep driveway and then decide to turn right into an embankment to stop?   Thankfully it happened to us, and not to our two sons who were later going to drive almost 2,000 miles across country to go back to college together. Imagine how easily driver error would have been labeled at this age group.    I have written to the Daimler Chrysler Customer Claims Resolution Group and to the five Directors of the Board of Daimler Chrysler, explaining what had happened. The only response I received was a brief and rather flippant letter from the Customer Claims Department denying that there was anything wrong with the vehicle but thanked me for raising my concern!  I think it is outrageous that such a large organization should be allowed to get away with this at the customer's expense.   I wonder how many more people this could have happened to, only they were never able to tell their story?",
"I bought a certified pre-owned 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee in Oct of 2005. A few months later, the car would overheat while driving up hills. I took the car to the dealership for repair 5/20/06. They told me it was the fan clutch and repaired it under my service contract. the car still kept overheating. I returned to the dealer on 6/2/06, but they said they could not figure out what was wrong and gave the car back to me. By 7/06, I took it in again and this time they told me it was the radiator and replaced it under the service contract. In 1/07, again the car over heated. I took it the the dealership again and they told me it was the radiator and replaced it under the service contract. In 5/07, the car overheated again. I took it in, but was told that I would have to pay for the new radiator because my service contract was up. When I called the manufacturer, the person said that before I owned the vehicle, it already had two radiators replaced. Between the overheating problems,the other repairs and the service warranty for the repairs, I have spent over $5000 in less than two years for a certified pre-owned vehicle.",
My Car was purchased in Feb 2002 in July 2002 I was picking my up child  from a birthday party at a local gymnastic center when my Grand Cherokee accelerated into the side of the building causing thousands of dollars in damages.  Luckily it hit the men's bathroom which was unoccupied at the time.,
"I owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee back in the 90's (well into the 100,000 miles)and LOVED it. Now i own a 2006 Jeep Commander. After a month of owning it, it went dead while slowing down at a yellow light. Everything went quiet. It's a good thing i was coming to a stop. It happened again while we were in traffic, idle. Then, while dropping off kids at school and going over the speed bumps on campus at UNDER 15 mph the front wheel base sort of came off place and it rattle and vibrated the car violently, until i stopped, reversed/forwarded the car a bit several times until the gears seemed to fall back into place. This has happened several times, even while going into pot holes...isn't this a Jeep?! This is one of the reasons i got it, so that i could be a bit rugged. Not so with a Commander. The dealership has tried to fix my complaints but the mechanics are at a loss. The only way for them to actually experience my complaints would be for them to come live with me indefinitely until these things happen again while they are riding in my car day in and day out. When my lease is due next September, i'm NOT keeping it.",
"2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee.Driver window broke 8/06.Cable regulator replaced under warranty.  5/30/07 Passenger window went down on its own.  Cable regulator broke.  
      Warranty expired 02/07.Contacted Huffines Jeep. Explained situation and that obviously Chrysler has some problem with their product.  They would not repair and gave me an estimate of around $380 to repair.",
"Bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee new from Donalson in Silsbee, TX.  2/25/06 The first front window just fell after 49,855 mileage.  Cost $347.83 to fix.  The power window regulator went out.  10/4/2006, the next front window again just slid down after mileage 60,334.  Replaced regulator through Dixie Glass services for $247.02.  Manager at Dixie Glass said the parts department was having a hard time keeping in stock because of all the demand for that part. Also, the price was rising.   Again, I walked out of work and my rear window has fallen.  
      Rarely do I use the rear windows, yet I will have to again replace the regulator.  I have it clamped shut because I cannot afford to replace the window regulator at this time.  The odds are that the other rear window will be falling soon anyway.  I have notified Chrysler about defect.  Another neighbor is having similar problems with her new Jeep windows.  I have both receipts for the work performed on the front windows.  Is there some recourse to this defective product?",
"We have a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 32,000 miles on it that had the check engine light come on.  Transmission was being hesitant.  Scheduled dealer appt. and 2 days before, trans. gave a loud clunk and stopped working.  Towed into the dealer and was told Chrysler declined warranty work until WE paid for and had a full transmission fluid change including filters, for $332.  Because we didn't have this done, the trans fluid lost it's prime.  I know of vehicles with 100k miles on them that haven't had service and run like clockwork.  I asked, if it lost the prime, where did the fluid go?  No answer.  We are now doing service at a private garage to see if this fixes problem for $100 instead.  If it does not fix problem, we will get out of lease early, pay penalty fees and NEVER buy another Jeep / Chrysler.  Funny, our 1986 Jeep CJ 7 is immaculate and runs beautifully.  Ever since owning Jeep Grand Cherokees (2000, 2003 and 2005), we have had problems.  No more.  Done.  Going with an import next.",
"I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Limited w/Hemi engine in December.  At 3,500 miles, the Jeep began randomly stalling out.  I took it in.  They said it was the Jeep's on board computer.  They fixed.  Happened again a week later.  They changed the ignition.  Happened again a DAY later.  I was told this could be the same glitch that is happening w/the Commander -2007.
      Loss time.  Loss money.  Sat on a Chicago expressway w/2 small children for 4 hours today waiting for a tow truck at great risk to my family.  Almost got broad-sided trying to make a left turn a week ago.  This is a DEATH TRAP!",
"Let me first say that to make my story so bad is that I work for Chrysler electronics in Huntsville. I have purchased 10 Chrysler products in the last 9 years, but not again. I have a brand new V8 Grand Cherokee. The vehicle surges, and especially really bad at 30-55mph. Sometimes it is only a slight surge, but at other times it is constant and more violent. I also have a popping noise at times coming from the right rear end. This Jeep only has 2,500 miles on it. It is so frustrating and I can't get anything done about it.
      I have taken the vehicle to the dealer 7 times in the last 2 months, and there response is as expected, that the vehicle performs as is designed. BULL!! I have repeatedly called their consumer hot line and they tell me that they rely on the dealers opinion, I asked to speak to someone higher up, and they told me that there was no one higher up. I called straight to the top to Tommy Lasorda's office. Of course they did not let me speak to him, but I have been in constant contact with his secretary. I have gotten no where. I asked for them to either give me a new one or give me my old vehicle back which they still have and they say absolutely not. Why does Chrysler think they are in the shape they are? And this dealer is horrible. It is a common joke where I work that you do not take a wheel barrow to this dealer to have it worked on.",
"I have had two incidences while driving my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee, the first time I was coming over a hill approaching a stop sign as I applied the brake the RPMs reached 6000 I was able to stop the Jeep with no problem with the brakes I put it in neutral and the RPMs continued to raise so I shut it off. I restarted and drove away fine. 
      Just last night I was driving to work while going up a very steep hill that has many twists and turns not to mention only small guard rails to keep me from plunging to my death the Jeep started to accelerate on its own and the brakes became hard I kept stomping on them until they finally grabbed and I could slow down enough to pull over put it in neutral and turn it off. This happened twice and I am now terrified to put my children in that vechicle. Unfortunately it is Easter Sunday so I am unable to contact my local dealership.. This is a lease vehicle with LESS than 2000 miles on it. I really hope something is done with this.",
My 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a lemon.  Repair after repair after repair.  and i am not alone.  Daimler Chrysler should refund our money for these vehicles.  No wonder the car manufacturers are tanking.  Their products stink.$4000.00 worth of repairs in the last 3 years.,
"My beautiful 32-yr. old daughter was killed as a result of a tragic automobile accident on October 31, 2006. She was rear-ended on Interstate-10 by a man driving a Ford F-150 pick-up truck. 
      The vehicle she was driving, a 2004 Jeep Liberty, burst into flames upon impact and my daughter was burned to death. Since my daughter's death, I have learned that this same thing has happened before and Chrysler has had numerous law suits that were settled out of court. The problem is, the fuel tank and filler neck on the Jeep Liberty (and Jeep Grand Cherokee) was designed and installed in a location (behind the rear bumper) that is susceptible to rupture or puncture in a rear-end collision. When gasoline escapes from a ruptured or punctured fuel tank, a high risk of fire and explosion exists. Chrysler knows full well about this problem, but apparently it is cheaper for them to settle out of court than to change the design of the vehicle. Because of this terrible tragedy and tremendous loss of such a beautiful life, I feel an obligation to warn everyone of the potential danger when driving these vehicles. The public has a right to know BEFORE they purchase these vehicles. I wish someone would have warned me.My daughter, a third grade teacher, was burned to death on her way to work. She had not yet celebrated her one-year wedding anniversay and she had just moved into her brand new home just 3 weeks before the accident. No vehicle should ever explode and burst into flames in a rear-end collision. Something should be done about this before others are killed needlessly.",
"I own a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  I thought I was buying a top of the line vehicle but at this point, I would never purchase a Jeep vehicle again.  I have had both regulators to go out in my front windows.  
      First the driver's side and then the passenger front window.  At a cost of $330.00 for the first and $350.00 for the second, needless to say I was very upset.  Not only did the window regulator explode but the very next day, the blend door stopped working.  I have heard from several friends that they have the same problem with theirs.  Now the blower control module for automatic air has also quit working.  Both of my front seats heaters have quit working. To fix the seats will run approximately $300.00 a piece and the blend door I have been quoted from the dealership will be between $1000-1200.  The blower control module is $187.00 w/o labor.  I am sure the labor will be at least $100.00.  Are there any recalls in the works for these problems?  I have about $2200.00 in repairs to get the car in shape to trade or sell.",
"On Tuesday, 3/6/07 my son was driving our 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee LTD when he pulling into his parking spot at work and the Jeep suddenly accelerated at full throttle.  He applied the brakes as hard as he could but flew right into into a concrete wall.  We heard from our insurance company yesterday and they did total the vehicle.  Thank God no one was injured (and that my grandchildren were not in the vehicle with him).  
      I think I'm also glad it was a total.  There is no way in this world that I would ever feel comfortable with my family being in that car again....and I wouldn't have wanted to try selling it to someone else. I can't believe with all the complaints I'm finding out about Chrysler takes no responsibility.  I feel totally screwed by the big corporate world.We have no GAP insurance on the vehicle.  The difference between the insurance payoff (less our deductble)leaves us having to come up with about $2,800 to pay it off.  And now we have no family size vehicle.",
"My Jeep Grand Cherokee was shifting hard going from reverse to forward, sometimes delaying. Recently, the car just stalled while decelerating. I took it to Battlefield Ford, Charlottesville, Virginia, where they started an investigation. They told me that the level of transmission fluid is to be exact or it will cause an imbalance of pressures in the torque converter lock-up clutch causing the stalling.",

"I was preparing to complete my left-hand turn at an intersection in my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, and before I could straighten out the truck it suddenly accelerated, hitting a vehicle stopped at the red light.  Fortunately, the other driver wasn't hurt, just shaken up and I was wondering what just happened.  I estimate the damage to be in excess of $2500.00 .  
      The part about this is that I'm concerned about is that NO AIRBAG(S) were deployed !!!!!Damage to the drivers-side front quarter panel, headlight array, bumper, fender and other damage not yet discovered.",
"On January 8, 2004 I purchased a new Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland, which I was reluctant to buy because of the poor history of Fuel economy I had read about. The salesman, Jason Fisher, passed me off to the sales manager, Neal Dow, and two other sales/business managers. They all assured me that my information was wrong, and assured me that I would get better gas mileage on the Jeep, then I was getting on my current Minivan of 16-18 MPG. 
      I returned a few weeks later to complain that I was only getting 10 MPG. I was advised to be patient for at least 2000 miles for the engine to loosen up. At 2000 miles I was advised to wait until I hit 4000. I have repeatedly contacted the sales managers, service managers, and finally the owner. I am now past 9000 miles and still getting the run  a round with excuses. I have been accused of not knowing how to do the MPG calculations at one point, that it was a result of my not topping off my gas tank (which is illegal in CA). They continue to insist that my Jeep is OK, and have no idea why the very poor gas mileage. I pointed ou the thick soot on my tail pipe, which I was advised was a sign that my carburetor was adjusted to rich...but they brushed that idea off. The new service advisor, Chris Ramirez, advised me the other day that he had the same Jeep, and was getting 22 MPG, not 10 like me. I feel like I was lied to in order to close a sale, and the fuel economy promised was greatly exaggerated. There only fix has been to offer to take it back as a trade in for another vehicle, but at my loss. I will be taking the loss in depreciation, plus paying the sales taxes, etc., again.",
"I also have had both front window regulators go out on my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The passenger side went out about 2 years ago and in the past month, the driver's side went out.  Not only has mine done this, but 3 other people that I know who own Jeep Grand Cherokees have had this happen to them as well.  I also called the company to see if there was a recall and of course they denied.  This seems very strange to me that there is no recall on the window regulators when 4 people (including myself) have had this happen to them.",
Sludge complete engine failure on my 2002 jeep grand Cherokee after 72000 miles.,
"I have not contacted Jeep yet. I have two Jeep Grand Cherokee's. A 2001 & 2002. Both belong to my two daughters. On 09 March, 2006 the 2002 Jeep I had the left front window regulator assembly replaced for a cost of $384.10. On 07 March, 2006 the 2002 Jeep I had the passenger front window regulator replaced at a cost of $384.10. On 12 July, 2006 the 2001 Jeep I had the left rear door regulator replaced for a cost of $328.13. Now the 2002 Jeep has another window that needs a regulator. Where does it end? Why can't the American car companies have a better product? What can I do to recoup some money? Thanks",
"I was employed as a car hauler. On July 3rd I was to load my truck at a dealership with auction cars. The first unit I was to put on my truck was a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, I put the vehicle in 4 wheel drive to avoid wheel spin while backing onto my truck. As I backed it on the rack above my cab I was just about in the position that the unit needed to be in. As I stepped on the brake the Cherokee lurched backwards crashing to the ground, rolling to the right before finally landing on the right side tires.  I was unaware of the sudden acceleration problems until I recently seen a news report on the Cherokee. Needless to say I was fired two days later.",
"In Sept. 2005 the regulator (window motor) needed to be replaced in  our 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee, front driver side door.   This was a $330 repair.  
      In June of 2006, the same thing happened to the window on the front passenger side window so I called Chrysler to see if there were any recalls on this problem.  They said no.  I decided to Google the problem and found there were lots of others out there with the same problem. Chrysler is willing to split the cost (another $330) of this repair with us.   I wanted them to so the same with the first repair back in Sept. 2005, but they refused our request. How ridiculous is it that a regulator (motor) went bad in both of the front door windows.  Chrysler is not standing behind their JEEP product.",
"After reading about sudden accelerations in Jeep Grand Cherokees, it took me back a few years ago when I was a valet. On more than a number of occasions, I experienced sudden accelerations when putting Grand Cherokees into reverse. 
      Luckily, I never had the misfortune of getting into any collisions, as I learned with driving an enormous variety of vehicles, that whenever I was putting a Jeep Grand Cherokee, a Dodge Durango, or even a Chrysler mini-van in reverse, to make sure my foot was firmly on the brake, and gently shift the gear into reverse. Had I not taken the precaution, I'm convinced that I would have been fired from being a destructive valet. I'm confident that there are plenty of others who deal with parking cars that they have had similar experiences.",
"My 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited takes off (accelerates wildly) without warning.  Has happened in both drive and reverse. It takes a mighty effort on the brake to stop it.  This has happened on 5 occasions and the dealer's service department says they haven't heard of the problem and beacuse it hasn't happened for them  they don't know what to do.  This is a major serious accident waiting to happen.
      I will not drive this car again but it presents me with a moral dilemma.  No one else should drive it either.",
"As I was braking at a stoplight my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee suddenly accelerated and roared forward, causing a 2 car accident. My foot was on the brake the whole time and yet the car zoomed forward like it was possessed.
      I am shaken and upset and angry. This is my only car and I am scared to drive it for fear the same thing will happen again. And this will affect my insurance as well!",
"About 1 1/2 months ago my wife complained to me about our 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee accelerating forward after the vehicle was place in Park and after my wife took her foot off the brake.  I didn't believe her then since I figured she must have had her foot on the accelerator and the car in Drive, not Park.  Well, this past weekend, 6-29-01, my wife got home with my kids and mother-in-law after going to the mall and parked the jeep about 1-2ft in front of the garage door.  She came to a complete stop, placed the jeep in Park and took her foot off the brakes.  
      To everyone's surprise in the jeep, the car accelerated forward, crashed through the garage door and then crashed into our other car already parked inside the garage (note: it's a one car garage).  Now I'm stuck with three insurance claims, one under each car's policy and one under our homeowners policy.  Allstate will pay for the damage and the dealership will fix the jeep, however, we don't want the jeep back.  It is NOT SAFE.  I can't imagine what could have happened if we went to Buffalo and Niagara Falls in the jeep as we intended to do that day.  Can you imagine being stopped at a scenic overlook and the jeep then catapults you into the gorge?!",
"On a Friday morning in late January, 2001 I was driving my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee (with only 5,000 miles on it!) to work... I came to a complete stop at a STOP sign... let a car go by... started up, going left at a slow pace (narrow back road in Massachusetts) and WHAM... my truck veered to the left, to the right, started to skid sideways and quicker than a wink slammed me forward into a telephone pole... all in an extremely short distance!!    
      It was as if my truck was   possessed ... which was exactly how I described to the local police.  I had no control ... there wasn't anything that I could do... the brakes didn't seem to work and the acceleration continued until it hit the utility pole.  In addition, my airbags did not deploy!    Thank goodness I didn't hit anyone and no one was hurt... I had bumps, bruises, a large bang on my head, etc....     Needless to say my husband and I immediately contacted Daimler Chrysler that same day (along with the insurance company and the rental car agency!!) and they did send out an investigator (who, based on input from the auto body shop, never even looked under the hood, since it is still jammed shut) ...and they did send me the findings.    According to the auto body shop, my damage starts at $7,000 and will increase once they are able to open the hood.",
