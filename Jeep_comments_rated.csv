"So I went in to replace the hose radiator outlet 2 weeks ago on my compass tailhawk and still no part is available. If you're going to create a part made specifically for Jeep then at least have the decency to have the part available. They had to know this would happen because they used plastic for a part next to the engine which, of course, is going to melt. I've been a Jeep lover for my whole life and now will probably never purchase again because they no longer keep the customers in mind, it's all about how to create $ for the company. Let's create a part that can't be purchased by any other manufacturer and not make enough inventory for the part.
      This must be an ongoing problem because it's gonna be a month until the part will be ready. How do they expect people to function or be able to go to work; when that is the only means of transportation they have? If you're curious the part number is **. Also, every garage I ever took my Jeep to said that Ford and Jeep are what keep them all in business because of all the problems that arise. I stopped going to the dealership service center years ago because I never had a good experience. I've been to over 7 in different states and same results so something internally needs to be fixed. This was my 3rd and last Jeep I will ever purchase. Do better!",0
"I was so excited to buy a Jeep but turns out it is the worst decision I have ever made. Between Jeep, Jeep Customer Care, and Preston's (Dealership & Service) the experience has been nothing but a frustrating headache! Bought a brand-new Jeep and it is still under warranty, all work and upkeep has been done by the jeep certified dealership, had been taking it back to the dealership for months on months telling them there is something wrong with it, motor was ticking, was bogging down, and screen going haywire. After 8-9 months of back and forth and many appointments and tests they say my motor is blown, it is burning through oil, a new vehicle with 26,000 miles on it. Jeep and the dealership have no answers just excuses. Customer Care is ridiculous, it has been over 2 months and no fix or response, and just a blame game between Jeep and the dealership and excuses.",0
"The 2015 Jeep Wrangler Willy I purchased is a piece of junk and have had nothing but problems since purchasing it a year ago. I've wanted a Wrangler my entire life. I finally was in a place in my life to afford one and I'm really regretting it now and have deep resentments in which I am most disappointed and full of rage. Jeeps are supposed to be long-lasting, reliable, and dependable. I have had constant problems. I know the vehicle had 107,500 miles on it when I purchased it but Jeeps are supposed to last 200k miles with their engine no problem. I know used vehicles are going to require maintenance and upkeep, but Jeeps have a high resale value and when you purchase one that is 7-8 years old and for $23k, you expect it to last longer and not end with you regretting it I could have afforded a brand new one by now with how much I've spend out of pocket. 
      The only thing I see major in the carfax was a radiator replacement. Since I've had the car, the right turn signal doesn't work properly and the abs light came on. I had to replace the rear hub assembly within the first month of having the car due to it being a sensor and having to replace it to fix it which cost $500. I didn't bother spending almost $200 to fix the blinker. I've had the oxygen sensor replaced twice. I've had the thermostat housing replaced as well as the thermostat. The fan has run super loud and had to have the coolant burped. The Oil Filer Housing was replaced on 1/23/23. I've been dealing with overheating for all of 2023. I moved to NV from NC 4 weeks ago and drove 2k miles. It overheated the entire way there. I was not able to use cruise control, I had to keep it under 70 mph. I stopped at Firestone complete repair and they replaced the radiator cap because they said the coolant was overflowing into the overflow tank and I needed a new engine because it would just be a matter of time before a hose or head gasket blew. I BARELY made it to NV just past the Hoover Dam and my Jeep stopped climbing. I had to pull over, blast the heat, roll down the windows, and put my hazards on going 30 mph until I hit a hotel in Henderson on 7/4. It was over 100 degrees and had my dog with me. This vehicle has put our lives in danger for 4 days and probably countless other times. My Jeep has been sitting at Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep in North Las Vegas since 7/12. They did not return my calls, texts, or emails. I had to physically stop in there with a rental car (which I paid for out of pocket) to find out what was going on. They still had no answers for me on 7/21 and said they see this problem all the time with these Jeeps and overheating, radiators, and cooling issues. I can't believe Jeep continues to let this be a problem and disregards the face. I've found multiple forums of Jeep owners complaining about these issues (even practically brand new). I am probably going to advise everyone against buying Jeep/Chrysler and should have gone for a Bronco instead. This was a HUGE mistake buying Jeep. The dealership FINALLY notified me on 7/27 that I needed a new cylinder head and that my Route 66 warranty was not going to cover it. Instead, the warranty will cover a head gasket and labor and Orville at Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep said he has never not seen this covered (even the most basic of warranties). I called my credit union who finances my load and who sold me the extended warranty (4 years) and informed her of my poor experience with them and that they haven't covered anything since I've had this piece of junk. Jim Marsh says the repairs total $6,755.06. The extended warranty is covering $2,747.80 and after some kind of sad discount, I owe $4,007.26. I cannot and will not pay this as I simply cannot afford it and why would I pay this much when this vehicle is guaranteed to have continuous problems after this. It is a money pit and the biggest loss I can remember. I had to put my dog down last weekend unexpectedly after hospitalizing it for 3 days (the only companion I had in my new state). I had to start a Gofundme to help pay for the medical bills and euthanasia. I can't grieve properly because I'm so full of anger and frustration dealing with my vehicle that has caused incredible pain and suffering (financially, physically, mentally). The moving company I hired still hasn't brought my belongings and it's been over a month. I am a single man doing the best I can and I maxed out all my credit cards and this is probably the second lowest point of my life. I hope no one has to know what this feels like...to have to deal with these matters after losing my dog and being in a new place and not knowing anyone. I simply do not have the energy, finances, or mentality to keep fighting these fights and am ready to give up. Maybe I can hire a lawyer one day when I can afford it and make up for these losses in my life. I feel so betrayed by a company I once fantasized and dreamed about. Jeep still hasn’t responded to my claim and it’s been 2 weeks. They do not care about their customers or providing a satisfactory product.",0
"I’m a mail carrier from the Dakotas.. so I purchased a RHD Jeep Wrangler in 2021. A year later I had a manufacturing issue and now again. Not only are they trying to take 4 weeks to fix it, but they’re not helpful with a rental either. BOTH issues are manufacturing issues and not ONE person cares. Jeeps are cool.. but they don’t back them up or help their customers. Garbage.",0
"My name is Deborah. I purchased a 22 Compass in February with 3000 miles on it. I totally fell in love with this vehicle, it ran like a dream as new vehicles should. At 5000 miles, the engine started running rough and the transmission started shifting hard. I took it to a dealership per the recommendation of Jeep customer service who opened a case and said it had to be checked by a certified Chrysler technician who then checked it out and they did a software update to fix a shifting problem between gears 1 and 2. When asked why as an owner I had not been notified of this software update, they told me that the only way to find out there is a software update is when you take it to a dealership for something else.
      After the return of my Jeep, the transmission shifting became worse. When I returned to the dealership the same day, a technician rode with me and felt the issue I had been discussing. During the week that my Jeep was at the dealership multiple technicians drove it and felt the issue with the transmission. I received a written statement when I again picked up my Jeep with the same exact issues. The dealership returned it stating nothing was wrong with it because it showed no code. The Jeep customer service closed the case.Within a week, the transmission became worse. I called Jeep customer service again and opened a new case and was told to take it to another dealership for diagnosis. I did take it to another dealership per suggestion. They had it for less than 24 hours and drove it approximately 2 miles, according to my odometer. While picking up my Jeep, they told me the Jeep was fine as there was no code showing and transmissions were different now than they were years ago, and the problem was that the transmission was trying to learn how I drive. Um, I have had the vehicle since February, it would know how I drive. I again called Jeep customer service who said they would push the issue to the Jeep technician. I received an email stating they had closed the case as the vehicle was not at the dealership.As the issue worsened, I called Jeep customer service again and was told it had been checked multiple times with no code showing there was nothing they could do. I then mentioned contacting a Lemon Lawyer, and suddenly, I was told to take it back to the dealership and have them open a STAR case. I called the dealership to make an appointment. When the dealership was able to get my Jeep in for service again, I told them it was recommended by Jeep to open a STAR case. I called multiple times to check on the work's progress. I was told every time that communicating with Jeep and a STAR case was very slow because they communicate by email. The dealership had my Jeep for a month. I received a call from the service manager saying he needed me to come and drive the vehicle so he could feel what I was talking about. I stopped by to drive the Jeep, while stopping the first time, the Jeep Jerked while downshifting. His explanation was the auto start/stop, which I turned off as I do not like it. The second time I had a problem with the shifting was taking off to accelerate. His explanation was that sometimes when stopping, the vehicle does not know which gear to be in, so it will jerk. At the time, I was accelerating not slowing down. At this point, I just told them to close the ticket and give me the Jeep back as they were not interested in trying to fix the problem. When checking out, I was told by the customer service technician that they had worked on my Jeep for about an hour. They had my Jeep for a month and worked on it for an hour. Unacceptable.I cannot take this back to the dealership I purchased it from because it has a mechanical issue, so I am stuck with a vehicle that is still running rough and a transmission that continues to shift hard. What do I do? Wait for it to die? Wait for it to stop while I am driving? This is a safety issue. Jeep customer service is blowing me off. I am looking for a Lemon Law Lawyer to help me. If Jeep does not help me with my Jeep, I will find someone who will.",0
"I leased my 2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee in October 2022. Not long after I noticed the Auto-Stop feature did not work. In the beginning I had to flood the brake as hard as possible to get it to work sometimes. After a very short time of having it just stopped working in its entirety. I made an appointment with Jeep to get it checked out. I dropped off the car and was informed there was a fuse that had to be replaced and that may have been the reason it was not working. I picked up my vehicle and as I drove home I noticed the feature was not working. I called Jeep again and brought it back in on a different date. This visit was less satisfying because they just told me nothing could be done because they were not getting any codes from their machine.
      I was so disappointed because I invested in this vehicle to have all the feature that it came with. Fast forward to about one month ago when I came to my car after a long day of work to find out my car was completely dead. Only after a few hours and many attempts to boost it finally turned on. The next morning I woke up to go to work and my car was completely dead again, I had to get another boost. I decided to take it to the Jeep dealer service not to far from my house in hopes I could get an answer as to why my brand new car was doing this. They said they couldn’t help same day and would have to leave my car there until they could check it out. I took a cab to drop my child off and then another cab to work.I got a call two days later that both batteries had to be replaced on my brand new car with approximately 3000 miles. After picking up my vehicle as I was driving all the the sensors on the dashboard started to pop up on the pop every two minutes including the emergency brake light and check engine light. I was freaking out because imagine driving a vehicle with all these sensor alerts on the highway with your child. I contacted the service person via email and send him a picture of what was happening. He encouraged me to bring it in that it wasn’t normal to do that. I took it back and they said about 30 codes pop up and a fuse had to be replaced. I pick up my car the next few days and the issue was still happening.I take the vehicle again and they were saying no codes were going up and without that there’s nothing that can be done. I explained how unsafe this was and that as a customer this was unacceptable. My car has been back and forth to get serviced all month. I am extremely disappointed. I wish I never decided on the brand Jeep. It seems to be unsafe and when things are failing doesn’t seem like servicing it would help with “no codes” come up in their computer. I would like to know what can be done about this and the safety and peace of mind of consumers who invest in this product.",0
"AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP AT ALL COST. The Director of Sales Michael ** is the most disrespectful, rude, condescending and homophobic customer service person we have ever had to deal with. Jeep should be ashamed to be represented by this type of person. This was the worst possible car sales and customer service experience we have ever had. We bought a new car on a Saturday and on Sunday when we noticed the alignment was off we brought it back to be serviced. It was serviced and in less than a week we had the same problem again. We brought it back to be serviced a second time and again in less than a week the alignment was off. In addition to that, every single warning light possible would come on randomly when driving the car. 
      At this point we contacted the Director of Sales Michael ** and told him we wanted a different car. We were told that he would look into the matter and get us out of the car and into another one. Later that day we were contacted by our salesman Tyler ** who told us he was asked to have us come in so we could pick another car on the lot and that they were going to work out the same deal even if it was at a loss for the dealership in order to make us happy and to make up for all of the inconveniences and problems we’ve had with the car. We went into the dealership on Friday and were told by the Director of Sales Michael ** that we had to wait until Monday so that he could have his service technician look at the car and get us into a loaner while also telling us that the car he could get us into was not on the lot. Not only were we lied to and manipulated, but we were also disrespected for being gay. The Director of Sales Michael ** was extremely rude and inappropriate in his interactions with us. To the point where he dismissed us by telling us he was going to contact Chrysler and undo the sale of the car. Apparently if it wasn’t this defective car, they were not interested in selling us a car. A car that initially they were very aggressive in getting us to purchase. We are now left without a car and having wasted almost a month in dealing with a car that should have never been sold.",0
"We purchased a new Right Hand Drive Jeep Wrangler in February 2021 (Chief blue) and a second in September of 2021 (Granite Crystal gray). In November of 2022, the wheel speed sensor went in the gray one. It is now March of 2023, and Jeep still doesn't have the part and has no date that the part will be in. This has put this Jeep with less than 50,000 miles on it out of commission! Jeep has done nothing but offer placating replies with absolutely no results! The lack of speed sense causes the Jeep to have no traction control, ABS, 4-wheel drive, cruise control, electronic stabilizer and the check engine light is on. We live in New York and it is winter sp this 2021 Jeep is worthless! I am beyond frustrated that a company as large as Jeep has done absolutely nothing to resolve this situation!",0
This vehicle was leased in April 2022 and has now been at the dealer waiting for a new motor. Jeep continues to say that they are waiting on the new engine.  This has been since October 2022 and has been in the shop longer than on the road. I have tried working with Jeep on a resolution but they continue to drag their feet. I requested a buyback and they said that it may cost a fee to do so. Not sure how it works but it would be nice if this company would stand up for their product and hold themselves responsible for poor quality.,0
"Never had such horrible service on anything I have ever purchased - let alone a $60K Jeep Gladiator - brand new - driven off the lot with 6 miles. Things happen, but the response and service has been worse than imaginable. Nobody even cares, calls, updates, nothing. The car has 1,900 miles, was towed into the dealer and we hear nothing. JEEP Wave service reaches out, we call back, nothing! (Thanks Brandi - for NOTHING). This is my 4th JEEP and this is the treatment. Never again based on the response so far. Inexcusable. If I operated like this, I would be out of business.",0
"Consider yourself warned. At 47,000 miles my Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT ($70,000 vehicle) had the lifters fail which is a widely reported issue. As a result, the cam shaft deflected metal particles into the engine block which now requires me to put an entirely new motor into the vehicle. Roughly $10,000 in damages and repairs. These types of damages are not covered under comprehensive insurance, you will be left holding the bag and Fiat/Jeep/Chrysler will NOT HELP YOU AT ALL. My car was perfectly maintained at all times, this is a defective engine design and if you're in the market for one of these vehicles BEWARE. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere, do not buy these vehicles. They are plagued with issues and you will cause yourself an enormous headache.",0
"Got my dreamy Jeep gladiator 2 months ago, it’s most expensive mistake I ever have, comes back to the dealership first injector number 2/3, got it back a day later the car stops and have to be towed back to the dealership, now they said is injector 4. Still there at this moment.",0
"I have 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee L that was bought back in January of 2022 drove it up til April 17th. My wife was pulling of a parking lot and the transmission went into limp mode. Had it towed to the dealership 3 days later got it back and they said they did software updates. Drove it for a week and while my whole family was in it and taking a turn from a stop sign when they got up to 15mph it through itself in park and the transmission clicked loudly. Had it towed again to the dealership where it sat there for 56 days before getting it back with a new transmission. 
      I called Jeep customer service several times and got a case manager involved. I only heard from her one time on May12th. I have asked for the vehicle to be bought back under Lemon Law which states that if your vehicle is in the shop for 30 days or more within the first year or same defect of the vehicle at least 3 times they buy it back. I would have to say I will never buy another FCA unit again. The dealership had no communication with me nor did the FCA customer service. When I called to talk to a supervisor they would never send me to one or have one call me back. The dealership didn’t want me to take back my vehicle on a 3 1/2 hr trip because they didn’t want me to break down again. So either they aren’t sure it was the transmission or they aren’t sure the new one will hold up.",0
"We recently bought a 2022 Jeep Gladiator, after four days of owning it problems started. It has been at Kindle dealership (cmch) numerous times and every time they tell us it's fixed it's not. They have replaced numerous parts and still having issues. The dealership itself is awful and I'm upset we even chose to go there. Service is awful, they never answer phones, rude customer service, and absolutely no respect or concern for our situation. JEEP says they started the buy back but it's going nowhere. 
      My husband is getting deployed in two weeks, we are moving to a new state with four kids and three animals. We needed this Jeep to help us with the move. How can service be so bad? How can you expect people to drop a massive amounts of money on vehicles that don't work or even give them the service they deserve. This has been so stressful for us and not to mention financial hardship. We are paying for a brand new broken vehicle and having to get rentals twice now just so we can function as a large family. Jeep needs to do better for their customers and I don't not recommend Kindle dealership at all. Please someone see this and light a fire under someone's butt. We leave in two weeks and my husband will be on a boat. I will not have time to deal with this on my own with everything else going on. Jeep you have a massive problem on your hands! Do something please!!!!",0
"Where do I begin. Long story short, I purchased a 2021 Jeep Gladiator which I started off loving. I've leased Acura's most of my life. Here we are today, not even a year later and my Gladiator has left me stranded on the Turnpike. It's still under warranty but it's as good as nothing. They towed it to 2 different dealers because first dealer was telling me that they will not have anyone to look at the Jeep until AFTER 30 days and no rentals/loaners available and second dealer told me same but they had a rental they could provide. Transmission was declared damaged. On a BRAND NEW Jeep. We can all say that we purchase nee vehicles to avoid problems like this right? Well, not in my case. I have never owned a brand new car, or even old cars; that have given me these issues. 
      I have been in contact with Jeep and no one there has been helpful at all. I keep getting that my case manager will call me back and no calls at all. I have called them 5 times today and have gotten re-routed to an incorrect department, 5 times today. Keep in mind that I am still paying a loan on this vehicle and that I am also paying for a very expensive MOPAR service that I am not even using. I would not recommend Jeep to my worst enemy!!!",0
I have waited 3 years for a dash pad to be replaced under warranty part was ordered then after 3 years manufacture canceled order still not completed. I have lost value. I cannot use my defrosters. Dash is pulling on air bag. Now vents are being pulled out. When I call customer service I get the run around. 1 Star too much for this review.,0
"Bought a 2021 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon in July of 2021 for $63,000. Within a few months rust started to form on top of the rear bumper around the mounting bolts and streaming a rust stain around the rear steel bumper. The dealer declined repairs so I contacted Jeep customer service and opened a case and claim. They also denied the claim stating the rust was from ""outside influence"" whatever that means. I am furious that they would let a simple repair like this leave a customer furious and hating the car because of this. There are several others online with similar issues and a class action suit has been launched. My theory is it shouldn't have to come to this when paying a TON of $ for this car. I am still willing to speak to Jeep about coming to an amicable outcome.",0
"Berthod Motors in Glenwood Springs, CO and its corporate affiliates left my wife and I stranded for the holidays. After having paid out of pocket for a PCM replacement on our Jeep Grand Cherokee that also fried our battery and alternator last December, my Jeep began exhibiting the same issues as before at the beginning of this December. The PCM failed and fried a battery. I contacted Berthod Motors only to be told that while the part was still under warranty, it would be 2 weeks before a mechanic could even look at our vehicle to assess if it was truly the PCM that had failed again. Without option, we booked an appointment.
      I had our Jeep towed to Berthod the night before our scheduled appointment. The day of the appointment came and went with 0 contact from the dealership, although I had tried to call and left multiple messages. I had been left with no idea that the vehicle had even made it to the dealership. I was finally contacted by the service manager the following day saying that it was in fact a PCM failure, but due to not having one in stock, it would be another week before the repair would be made. It has now been 2 weeks with no end in sight.After once again not being contacted by Berthod Motors with an update to the status of the repair, I stopped in and was informed that the PCM is on backorder. The EARLIEST that the part could be available is mid January, 6 weeks after the vehicle broke down due to a faulty part being installed by Jeep. I was told by Jason, the service manager, that his hands were tied as far as not being able to make the repair any quicker or providing a rental car in between. Jason directed me to Jeep's direct customer service to see if they could be any help. I contacted Jeeps Corporate customer service line on Monday of this week. I explained my wife and I’s situation to the representative and while she was very kind, she informed me that she would have to escalate the situation and that she didn’t have the resources to actually help. It took another 48 hours for a different representative to call. Without hesitation the representative told my wife and I that there isn’t even a chance that Jeep would be willing to help us with a rental car and we would be so lucky to get the replacement PCM any quicker than what we were quoted from Berthod. This will be my wife and I’s last vehicle from General Motors. My wife, a teacher, has been a huge fan of Jeep since she has had her driver’s license. She has personally financed over 5 different models of Jeep Cherokees since our marriage. Already last week she suggested that we move over to a more dependable brand such as Toyota after this debacle. As a plumber in this valley, I could never stay in business, let alone stay employed if this is how I treated my clients. I would never think of or have the audacity to install a faulty part in a client's home and then leave them without water or heat after the part failed. Regardless of backordered parts. This has truly been one of the worst examples of customer care that I have seen in my life. This review will be updated as the situation progresses.",0
My Grand Cherokee is one of the best vehicles I've had. The seats could be a lot better far as comfort and the replacement parts are expensive. But I like the design of the whole car in general. My Jeep has been great. Just keep up the maintenance on your vehicle.,1
"Owned car since July 2021. Today 11-4-21 it sits in shop again for bad Uconnect screen/controls. No reliable screen means no climate control, radio, nav, phone connection. Service appointments are 3-4 weeks out and they won’t fix it. No loaners. Nightmare and I’m not sure based on documented visits they aren’t trying to avoid lemon law issues. Won’t say it’s same issue on paperwork???",0
"I currently own two Jeep vehicles. One I purchased new is a 2013 Grand Cherokee. It has been the most dependable, reliable, stylish vehicle that I’ve owned. Jeep has stood behind any issues I’ve had, which have been few. My second Jeep is a 2018 Wrangler Sport that I purchased used with 8,000 miles and under warranty. It’s also a great vehicle, easy to tow behind my motorhome, and fun to drive on adventures. I’ve had no issues at all with it.",1
"I leased 2021 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited 4xe couple months back from Stoneridge (Livermore) where started facing an issue with hybrid sign at odometer after couple months. Meanwhile, I went to close by dealership i.e. ELK Grove Jeep where they recognized or analyzed an issue with electric wiring needs to replace because those got burned out due to engineering or mechanical issue. Beside, they gave an estimate first for 1 week from fixation perspective and now they are keep on ignoring since September 2021.
      Moreover, I also talked to Jeep Customer service and also raised the case includes escalation where case Manager is careless as well and not responsive because they never reached out to me even single time about the status or any feedback. I'm literally fed up and stressed because they are harassing and ignoring customer instead of helping. Also, I requested them that my health is not good and I can't bear stress due to lung infection after covid19 impact but I want to state here on public side as well and manifest there carelessness about team services. Please, help me to resolve my matter asap otherwise Ii need to step-up for case filiation. Thanks & Regards.",0
"7/1/21 I was in a terrible car accident on the interstate. 28k damage to my Jeep Wrangler! I had no airbags nor did my seatbelts lock, we were violently thrown into dash, my husband has facial fractures even. Jeep did a inspection and denies any liability. So never ever spend 45k on a jeep wrangler unless it your preferred coffin!",0
"I've now owned five Jeeps. Two Grand Cherokees and three Wranglers (two JK models and one JL model). While I've had a hiccup or two, Jeep has been great about making things right and the vehicles have been reliable. The reliability and versatility have kept me a loyal Jeep customer. Recently, and unfortunately, we were the victims of an F-250 Super Duty red light running hit-and-run driver that hit us and ran totaling the vehicle with only 4980 miles. Me, my wife, daughter, and son, all walked away the kids with zero injuries and my wife and I with minimal airbag related injuries. To say I am thankful is an understatement. I'm so bummed that I lost so much of what I invested in my Jeep and am having trouble finding a replacement, but at the end of the day, we all walked away from a collision that had we been in a smaller vehicle, there would have likely been severe injuries or even death. Thank you Jeep!",1
I purchased my 2014 Hero Latitude in Oct 2015. I have had nothing but issues with this vehicle. I purchased it with a little over 35 thousand miles. I have had a new transmission in about Feb or March in 2016. I have had a transmission mount replaced I. 2017 and another in -Oct 2020. I have had the shifter replaced or repaired about 2016. I’m having an issues once again with the shifter. I have had the throttle replaced in 2020. I current have over 76 thousand miles on my vehicle because I’m too afraid to drive too far. I will not even take a road trip for that reason.,0
"I have 2 Jeeps. One is a 2012 Jeep Patriot that has minor issues that haven't cost a ton. The other is a 2017 Jeep Compass that has had major financial issues recently. I have an extended warranty on the 2017 Jeep as I bought it used. I took it to my local Jeep dealership when it started hesitating and engine lights went on. They claimed it was a spark plug, maintenance issue that cost me over 500 dollars. 
      Then less than 2 months later same issues same lights on. I took it back to dealership and they diagnosed it with a throttle body problem that was going to cost me an additional 700 dollars (not under warranty). I towed it away but had to pay the 130 for the diagnostic problem they should have seen/fixed the first time. My 2012 Jeep has a 4wd light on ever since I took it to same dealership to fix a recall problem. My honest mechanic said the dealership pinched the wires when they fixed the recall problem. I will never buy another Jeep or go back to Newport Jeep for anything.",0

"DO NOT BUY JEEP! Please look into other credible vehicle brands. Please believe ALL the reviews about their terrible service! First of all, let me first say initially my car is fairly new. It is still under warranty, and it started stalling. Well I find out via mail it’s a recall on the electric system that starts the issue ok... ""Well my car isn’t driving properly. Can you all pick it up?"" ""Well let us get back with you.. Yes we can."" My car gets to the dealership. They won’t service my car unless I sign some paperwork. ""Understandable. Can you do e-docusign?"" ""No."" ""Can you pick me up?"" ""No."" ""Can you bring the papers to my home?"" ""No."" I had to hire an Uber to jeep and back $40. 
      ""When will my car be fixed?"" ""We don’t know."" Dealership calls back.. ""Can’t fix your car ma’am. We are backed up 4 days."" ""Can you provide a loaner car?"" ""No."" ""Why?"" ""Corporate says it must be a service that requires at least 48 hours. Your service only takes 20 minutes."" I spent almost a wk getting a Uber back and forth to work $100. A week after my car is fixed, car stalls out again on a major highway. I’m almost killed! At this point I’m ANGRY. Same thing. No loaner car, I can’t get to the dealership to sign off, I spent OVER $200 on appointment cancellations, Uber rides, and food delivery services! No rentals are available in my area. ""We gave you a case manager. She’s not available until Monday morning. You will have to wait..."" Guess who will be doing Uber again on Monday morning?? DO NOT buy Jeep. The customer service is terrible. I get better service buying a $3 chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A than I have buying a 32,000 vehicle!! I’m filing a suit, giving bad reviews until the day I die! I’m that angry over these selfish, greedy, unreliable, jerks!",0
"I want to start off by saying that I come from a family of multiple Jeep owners (husband, mom, dad, brother, mother-in-law, etc.) as we all love Jeep. More so, I was looking forward to purchasing a second vehicle for myself (of course a Jeep) because they have been reliable cars, or so I thought, and I had faith in the Jeep Company. That was until my unfortunate and super expensive experience that has kickstarted my 2021 year. While driving back home shortly after New Year’s Day, my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee with only 66K miles, suddenly decided not to turn back on after stopping for gas. Fortunately, I was able to tow it to the nearest Jeep dealership, where I only go to for car service. Since it was the holidays, there was a delay in my car's diagnostic. 
      After 4 days of being at the Jeep dealership, I was finally informed that my fuel pump and wiring had to be replaced for about $1,500 plus tax because nothing that needed repair was covered under warranty. Now, let's add $1,500 plus tax to the total cost that I have been incurring with rental car, stay, food, etc. since my 2015 Jeep, with only 66k miles, stopped working while I was 4 hours away from home. I decided to call the Jeep warranty customer care to get clarification on what is covered in my warranty. After speaking with several customer care agents, they all shared that my fuel pump is covered under the manufacturer’s warranty for up to 7 years or 100K miles, which conflicted with what the Jeep dealership shared. Additionally, I was told that I had trip interruption protection for up to 100K, which would help with all the costs I was incurring being 4 hours away from home. Unfortunately, the Jeep car dealership and the Jeep warranty customer care were not agreeing, which caused additional delays in my car getting fixed. After speaking with various customer care numbers for 2 days that were being provided to me by each representative, it was finally confirmed that my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee’s fuel pump and wiring was not covered under any warranty. Additionally, the trip interruption plan that I was told I had, was indeed not true. Now I understand that rules are rules. However, this experience has left me with 2 burning questions: 1) How reliable are Jeep cars to break down at only 66K miles? 2) How reliable is the Jeep Company with ensuring proper employee training so that customers are not misled? -Sincerely disheartened by Jeep!",0
"I bought this car brand new and have now had it for 2 years. It has been the worst car I have ever had in my life. The windshield is a magnet for chips and you can tell that it is bad quality, have had two chips and one crack already driving on paved roads. The paint is also cheap as it chips very easily with normal driving. And the biggest issue other than all the recalls, is that my car takes the most expensive oil which is full synthetic and for some reason it is empty at 3,000 miles. Have taken it to the dealer and even called Jeep and nobody seems to be able to fix the issue. They just tell me to keep adding oil because these cars are notorious for doing that.
      It is a safety issue because the car stalls while driving since it is constantly running out of oil, but neither the dealers or jeep seem to care. That's not to mention all the problems I had with the radio trying to get Android Auto to work properly, jeep kept telling me that the problem was I needed new usb cable but in the end I found out on my own that the actual problem were the apps on the radio. Basically jeep never has answers to anything, you have to figure it out on your own like you are the one getting paid to do the job. Best thing I can do now is get rid of this jeep and never do business with them again.",0
"I have a 2016 Jeep Patriot that I've owned for not even 2 years. On July 31st the engine blew up on me and I have contacted Jeep and was told even though my Jeep is barely over the warranty coverage....I'm out $4000 on a new engine!!!! Im a disabled unemployed Iraq war veteran, but hey apparently Jeep doesn't care about the soldiers and veterans to even remotely make it right or do anything to help.... I shouldn't have to foot this bill for a new engine in such a new vehicle.... Absolutely garbage customer service and helpfulness in a persons time of need.... Don't waste your time with a vehicle that will blow up not even before its next oil change after the warranty expires.... Get you a vehicle with 100k mile warranty and actually be covered....",0
"I purchased a brand new Jeep Compass in September 2015. I owned jeeps previously but not a compass and never had problems like I am having now. At 3 years old my compass radio went out and needed to be replaced the car has 30,000 miles on it but the radio was not covered under warranty. It cost me 450.00 to replace it. In 2019 at 4 years old I needed a new wheel bearing and had to replace front and back breaks rotors and pads to the tune of over 800.00. Car had 35,000 miles on it. In June of 2020 a sensor for the battery went and car would not start. I had to have it towed to the dealer for 200.00. The sensor cost 12 dollars but I was charged 300.00 for 2 hours of labor. Now the 4wd, traction control light and ABS light all came on.
      When I took it to my local mechanic he said the wiring for these sensors was all corroded and would need to be replaced. He did not give me an estimate but told me it would be very expensive. The car has 42,000 miles on it. I am very disgusted and would not recommend this vehicle to anyone. I called Jeep and they told me they Couldnt help as my warranty ended Sept. 9 2020. Nice Company!",0
"I feel bad I have to write this but....I bought a Jeep Compass back in March 2019 from the Route 46 Jeep Dealership in Little Falls, NJ. DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP!!! IT IS TERRIBLE. I had to wait over an hour until they found the vehicle I was inquiring about. Then the finance guy, Alex **, was awful in giving me all of the details of my loan. Very rushed and basically didn't care about what was best for me. I was told the Compass was certified and when i went to sign the papers, it was not for the amount quoted online as the sales price. I had to pay an additional 1200 for the certified fee! This was not disclosed or mentioned in any paperwork until I sat down with the finance person at the last minute. Very unprofessional. I waited to speak to the manager of the dealership before I left, but he was conveniently unavailable for over an hour.
      Next issue-had car serviced at the Morgantown, WV dealership in October 2019. Then in June 2020, the car stalls out on me. I had vehicle towed to a White Plains, NY dealership. Issue was that the Morgantown dealership left screws of the torque plate in the car and they punched a hole in my motor and transmission. Now I find out the parts are not coming in until October 2020. I have been without a vehicle from June 2020 and will not get my car until October 2020. Jeep is not helping me at all! Issue was Jeep's fault and they are doing nothing to help me. Very frustrated. Will never buy a Jeep again.",0
"Bought a 2019 Jeep Cherokee Limited 6 cyl. in Oct. 2018.. Biggest mistake Ever.. From the first week issues started. As the months passed the issues became more and more serious..and ONLY A COUPLE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED, LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING... AND TODAY ANOTHER ISSUE.. CAN'T PUT GAS IN IT!! IT SPITS IT RIGHT BACK ON ME!! SO I called the dealership and in a week or so I can have it ""looked"" at..so I called CS at Jeep and got the same reply.. I think sooner would be a nice thing!! 
      Everyone I have spoken to says theirs too, is a total nightmare.. Just ""DO NOT BUY ONE"".. I NEVER WILL AGAIN!! JUST CALLED MY CHRYSLER dealer who I bought my 300s from. They'll get me in tomorrow.. Yay..Chrysler Of Waseca Mn. Best dealership around!! Issues include..paint lift, no working seatbelts, lock out, lockdown, screen went blank then horizontal lines, jerking, won't start, won't accept gas, radio on and off.. I have asked right away for Jeep to take it back when I had no working seat belts on day one but no reply.. They did repair the seatbelts... I'm glad I have my old 1995 Chrysler Lebaron convert ...much more reliable than this 2019 JEEP!!",0
"2017 Jeep Renegade, problem car: 56,000 miles power steering went out, belt is intact, Power steering module is bad, must purchase steering rack (not sold separately) with module. Repair cost about 2014$ plus tax. Will not be purchasing another Jeep product. Had Dodge Journey with 89,000. Did not have any problems.",0
"Cute car but piece of crap. 2019 Jeep Compass. In Aug of 2019 I complained about engine noise a month after when backing up and was ignored. 5/9/20 car started and would move two ft and cut off and parking break & engine light comes on. Now my truck with 10,000 miles on it is sitting at a dealership. This is a damn safety hazard because I was pulling on a busy street when it cut off. I’m going to get rid of it somehow.",0
Do not buy a Compass. 2.4 litre motor burns 1qt of oil per 2000 miles and that meets Jeeps criteria for a good motor. Back up camera worthless if car driven on other than dry pavement and no back up sensors. Gears 8 & 9 will not maintain speed even on flat roads. Rear window defroster fails to clear window as melt builds up on the wiper making it worthless. Snow slush and mud build up on the tire causing all wheels to become unbalanced. Who pays for a at of oil every 2000 miles and why isn't that fact listed in specs? My second Jeep - first and last. What car would you buy knowing it'll use a at of oil every 2000 miles? No support from Jeep and a sad sad car the Compass is.,0
"Crooked Dealership! Lemon Cars Stay Away!! If I Could Give Negative stars I Would! ...So less than 2 months ago I purchased a 2012 Jeep Compass with 123k miles. Financed through Pronto Finance out of Schaumburg, Illinois. 1st month in vehicle stalled out while pulling up to a stop sign. Just this week the car has stalled out 6 times all while driving on the freeway! One of those times with my 5 year old daughter making a U Turn during rush hour! Car in the middle of the road! Every time this happens, it literary takes 5 or more minutes to start back up again! Did some research online and apparently this is a known issue with other Compass owners and Chrysler intends to do nothing about it until someone gets killed in an accident! 
      I called the salesman ""Jorge"" and he told me to call the finance company because he ""thinks"" it has a warranty? Hello! I bought a used car as is. Of course it has no warranty!. Just getting the runaround from everyone but rest assured I'm taking matters into my own hands. I'm going to make a special YouTube Channel to document every time this vehicle stalls out or goes into ""limp mode"". Going to put them all on blast until this matter is corrected or that crooked dealership shuts its doors for good!!! I know very well the power of the internet and social media and I'm going to use it to MY advantage. They knew I was desperate for a vehicle and they preyed on me like the snakes they are! I'm a hardworking customer making payments on time! You Tube Link coming soon!",0
"I purchased a 2019 brand new Jeep Compass in October 2019. The car radio which has all my controls on it went out on 1/14/2020. They are unable to fix it until the second week in February. Jeeps are junk and the service turn around sucks. I would never buy another Jeep again. If you are wondering if Jeep is the way to go I will gladly remind you, they are terrible on gas as well. DO NOT GET A JEEP!!",0
I own a 2015 Renegade with 47k miles and it has been in the shop three times in the last 45 days. It is currently in the shop now going on 31 day and it is still not fixed. It is have a power and drive issues that they have pointed at electrical as the main issue. I have opened a case with Jeep Corp and they have not done anything to assist the dealership and the case manager David and his manager Samantha have done nothing but hang up on me and not give a ** about me the customer. I have made two payments for a car that I can’t even drive and they won’t give me a loaner for more than the first 10 days. I am screaming at the top of my lungs get off your ** and send or get the right person on the phone with the dealership to fix my Jeep. If anyone wants to get any further info and you are from Jeep call Xtreme Dodge in Jackson Michigan and they will know my case.,0
This vehicle is a great medium size SUV. Bought to pull behind an RV. It served that purpose and as a great car for a couple. Very versatile and reliable. No problems and love the diagnostic monthly report.,1
"The Jeep is sturdy, strong, reliable and handles very well. It is comfortable to ride in, hauls my pets and Craigslist finds - and when washed is beautiful and elegant. A win win all around. I enjoy the 'little' things like heated seats, back window wiper, easy-to-pull down back seats and durable leather interior. It is three years old so it is relatively modern in style but it is sleek and gets the job done!",1
"Overall a great car, especially for New England weather. Great handling and control in snow! Very comfortable interior with plenty of space. Holds more than expected when I moved, which was a great surprise. Only issue is once they hit about 9 years old, the repair bills start and come often and at an up there price tag. If you don't have a trusted mechanic, you'll want to find one once that 9 year mark hits.",1
"Sunday my Jeep 2019 Compass 13,000 miles wouldn’t start because of “software malfunction.” Got roadside assistance Monday morning to get it towed from a shopping center the car stopped at to dealer. Next day they gave me the car saying it’s fixed. Next morning same thing happened. I was in school so I arranged the car to get towed from my school. No one came for an hour so I called back and roadside said it was no records of it. I created another request of roadside around noon. They promised to pick it up within 60 min. At 7pm I called the dealer to see if it was dropped off and they had no record of it. I called back roadside assistance and the pick up was cancelled. No one called or texted to let me know. Then they said sorry. They arranged for my towing. It will be there in 60min.
      It’s 8pm. I still don’t know if my car has been picked up, towed, stolen (because they tell you to leave the keys inside the car). God knows what would happen. There you have it, Jeep Warranty roadside assistance. It’s been 8hrs and I have no idea what’s going on with my car. I could have been stranded on the side of the road with a baby and they wouldn’t know I need help. Seriously baffled at how a huge multimillion dollar company has such third-rate unacceptable customer service and emergency response team.. Mind you that is a warranty issue. NEVER BUYING A CHRYSLER IF ITS THE LAST CAR STANDING.",0
My Jeep Compass is a nice small SUV. Good on gas but don't recommend driving it on turnpike in bad weather. I took my car on the turnpike Thanksgiving day. The wind was bad that day. I was scared and nervous. The wind had my car swirling. I need me a bigger suv.,1
I own or I should say paying to own my Jeep. I have had it for 3 years. So far it has been dependable. Not a fan of how the transmission works. It shifts but not always when it needs to. Been that way since the day I bought it. Since I have had it we have not had any real expensive repairs. We had to take it to the dealership to have a wheel sensor replaced. Other than tires and a realignment its been trouble free. I would recommend a Jeep Compass.,1
"Bad experience w/ the dealership, so that's 1 negative rt off (honesty should count). A roughly $30k car 4yrs ago should buy a solid warranty. Not at Jeep. New vehicle gets only a 35k mile or 3 yr! Currently at 31k miles, the car itself has been reliable, no breakdowns, only regular maintenance (so far).",0
"Third Jeep I've owned: 2 Wranglers and this Liberty. Liberty has too many issues, too many repair problems: heater/air conditioner, leather seats ripped, front shocks, door locks, radiator. Like Jeeps, but wouldn't recommend the Liberty.",1
I buy Jeeps and have had four in my life. It's a fun car to drive and it's sexy too. It keeps the cool in style look and sense cars are so expensive today costing more than the lower 80% of Americans even make enough money to pay to own. This one is a little better or easier to buy. One problem is the transmission on all four of my jeeps breaks down after the 3500 mile warranty expires and it's a major fault in jeeps.,1
The Gladiator is just fun to drive. All the controls are in a nice position. The seats are very comfortable and adjustments are place you in a great driving position. With a longer wheel base over the Wrangler the ride and handling are enjoyable.,1
"Jeep Renegade is really underpowered, really heavy and bulky. Has a lot of blind spots. Seats are semi comfortable. Not worth the value in my opinion. Rides and handles with really smooth. Could be better on gas mileage.",1
"I love my Jeep, however, when one thing needs to be fixed. 2 or 3 things follow. It is trail rated, but be the rust consumes the bottom sides. Everything is very expensive to fix also. I've always wanted a Jeep since I could drive. I just got one. 47 years later, lol. Just wish I could of gotten a good one.",1
I love my 2018 Jeep Compass but I am having issues with the back up camera. I have had the camera replaced once. This didn't resolve the issue so the radio was replaced. It started having a black screen again. Finally the dealership was able to see this issue and they are ordering yet another radio Another issue I am having is the driver's side seat panel keeps popping out. No I'm not morbidly obese. This has been fixed 4 times. I just picked my truck up the Friday after Thanksgiving and it is now back broken. Was told by the dealership these issues are known issues and that I am going to keep having them.,0
"I bought my 2017 Jeep Renegade Limited in January 2018. Less than 2 years old.. My problem started around 16k miles. (I'm now at about 23k). Friday I go in for my 3rd consumption test. I'm burning oil. Getting to the ""dangerous"" part of the dipstick after 1000 miles, I didn't buy a new car so I have to babysit the oil level in it.. It's not the 1970's! Why should I burn 1 quart of oil per 1000 miles? Other newer cars can go 10k miles between oil changes, I feel duped and cheated. I also think there's something wrong with the low oil sensor, it only comes on when I take extreme turns and doesn't stay on. I'm busy with my eyes on the road taking the turn, not watching my dash.. I had to have a passenger point it out to me!",0
"Great car, love the interior design. Sound system is awesome. Had some trouble with rear something on car, better now. Jeep fixed it for almost nothing. Service has been excellent. Anytime I have a problem they take care of it and I always get really fast service.",1
This vehicle we have had been great for us for the last 5 yrs. The only issue is the motor. We had the lifters and rockers replaced under warranty just under the 100 000 miles but they went bad again and we don't have the money to repair it again. The only problem with the 2014 Jeep is the motors have issues that we believe Jeep knows about but have not said anything. I have heard the 3.6 is not a good motor.,1
"I bought my 2017 Jeep Compass brand new, the 8th month in I was driving on a busy street when my oil sensor went off and caused my car to slow to a stop and my steering wheel to stiffen. Mind you, the oil light went off 3 days prior and Jeep's response when I took it in? “It burns oil every 3k miles, this is normal according to their standards and that’s just a sensor”. Flash forward to a radio repair, back up camera repairs (needs to be replaced again) and multiple oil issues and it has now been declared a lemon. To say the process even with an attorney has been simple would be a lie. It has been a total nightmare to get Chrysler to take back THEIR defective vehicle. If you are looking for a car for yourself or family I would highly suggest doing your research and never, ever buy a Jeep/Chrysler vehicle. If I could rate 0 stars I would have.",0
I have had the radio in my Jeep replaced for the third time. I got a call from the dealership saying my new radio was in. I took my jeep in and had the radio replaced with the new one when I called XM to have it activated and the radio ID belong to a different name and address so it could not be activated because the radio ID belong to somebody else which means the radio was not new. It came out of another vehicle. I cannot believe this is the way that FCA does business and I’ve had to take my jeep then at least eight times for issues since I bought it new and I’ve had it for 13 months. I am never going to trust FCA again. I am going back to General Motors.,0
"I paid $3000.00 for a lifetime warranty on my Jeep. I have never missed an oil change and I check all of my fluids but my Jeep Liberty does not have a dip stick for the transmission fluid. My transmission went out in my Jeep. I was so happy that I purchased the lifetime warranty until I took my jeep in and found out that they will not pay for my transmission because they said the oil pan rusted and the transmission fluid leaked out. The jeep dealership never mentioned any rust or leaks when I got my oil changed, there is no light that comes on on the dash to indicate low fluid and no dip stick to check the fluid. I paid an extra $3000 for that peace of mind but now I have to pay another $3000 for a new transmission.",0
"I purchased my Sahara in Dec 2018. It was the first 2019 on the lot. I started having issues with my middle console latch. It was replaced until it broke again and I had to wait for Jeep to make a new part. Then I started having issues with my seat. The worse part comes March 2019 when I started to experience death wobble. Violent shaking of steering and the front end goes crazy after you hit any imperfection. This is on a stock vehicle.
      They put a steering damper on it. Was told this is a band aid fix but I figured for the motor trend suv of the year the dealer knows what they are doing. Nope. Having the same issue. This time going 70 mph on the highway with my kids in the car. Almost had an accident. What does Jeep wanna do? Put another steering damper on it. They refuse to buy the car back so I’m stuck with a $50k car I can’t drive over 45 mph. Please please don’t purchase these cars. The FCA only will throw a band aid at it if they are threatened with a lawsuit.",0
"My son purchased a used 2011 Jepp Liberty with the sky slider roof in 2017. The car was in excellent condition when we purchased it in 2017. Low miles, clean and in great running condition. However no one ever notified us of the horror that was about to happen with the sky slider roof. As cool as it looks and opens, the roof is a piece of garbage. 
      One warm summer night my son decided to open the roof to get some fresh air in the car only to find once he got home that the roof was never to close again. We tried and tried but to our dismay the roof would just not close. SO then the next step was to call Jeep. We just about got laughed at on the phone, with the service men telling us they no longer make the parts for the 2011 Jeep Liberty and basically we were screwed. Hmmm a 2011 and no parts. How can you explain that. Now what do we do with this car??? We can not sell it, we can not trade it in, we ARE STUCK!!! Now we have contacted an auto body shop that can possibly take a roof from a Jeep Liberty with the same sky slider roof, that was in an accident and put it on my son's vehicle.... for $3,000 dollars. So now, my son still owes $7,000 on the car and we HAVE to invest another $3,000 just so he can drive the damn car. I will never ever buy another JEEP in my life. This car has been nothing but a headache and the Jeep dealers are horrific people.",0
"I have a 2015 Jeep Rubicon with 30K miles. I have the Life time Mopar protection, which in the case does me no good. The Jeep stalls about 2 times a week. I have brought it in for this twice now and they say they cannot find anything wrong because when is stalls it does not send any codes to the computer. I called the factory and they said they can not do anything. At this point I am very frustrated and they cannot replicate the problem. I am not sure how much effort they put into it. I am no afraid of sending my daughter off to college with this Jeep. It is a really nice vehicle and cost a lot. Not sure what to do now.",0
"I bought a 2018 Jeep Renegade August of 2018. This past year I have been paying for oil changes every 2500 miles or so. (Should be 5k with synthetic.) That's 116$ bill. I honestly thought the place I had doing my oil changes was gypping Me on oil. I took it to a few different places. After the vehicle started displaying oil pressure low on the screen and shut off, while on a major highway doing 57 mph with my 6 & 2 years old boys in the back. This happened a few times while driving. 
      A mechanic at Valvoline told me the renegades were having this issue and the engines are bad.. funny.. Would have been nice if Jeep or Chrysler had sent out a warning or recall! They knew this was happening and have ignored warning their good paying customers. So for the past YEAR I have been paying 721$ (on time!) a month for a vehicle that was a lemon, paying for twice as much oil, and being legitimately in harm's way every time my family and I got in this car.They are replacing the engine. Have me a loaner for the week... I expressed how uncomfortable I am now driving this vehicle and everything that I've been through. And I'm sure the other countless renegade drivers out there with no idea! Jeep is just going to wait until someone gets fatally hurt to issue a recall on the engine. I will not be dismissed. That's what they keep doing! When I call Jeep or go to the dealership. I am a person, this is my hard earned money and I will NOT BE IGNORED. I hope people see this and get their car checked. I want to be heard. You wronged me. Get it together Chrysler Jeep!!!!",0
"Finance manager screwed up our lease so bad that he had to drive to Rockford to have us re-sign a new lease. He processed the original and didn’t send in the new one. I had been making payments on the account number I received and not the one he sent in. In the end, we ended up with 5 inquiries on our credit score, a new alias as he misspelled my last name, dealing with proving my payments with bank statements, a harassing phone call from the dealership wanting payment over the phone, a repossession notice/Chrysler saying we were current, and a GM that wouldn’t return our calls. Luckily, Chrysler Finance has been the only one that has been helpful and straightened things out for us.",0
"I have had nothing but issues since I leased my Jeep Renegade in 2016. The most recent issues required for a part to be replaced, that was already replaced a year ago; as well as a second new replacement of a different part. I took the car back and forth 6 times in one month and the car had less than 30,000 miles on it. I contacted Jeep asking them to terminate my lease (10 months remaining) and they refused because it didn't meet the Lemon Law for the State of Massachusetts. They rather have me in an unsafe and unreliable car than do what is right for the customer and try to keep a Brand loyal customer. I will never drive a Jeep ever again. I would NEVER recommend Jeep to any friends or family.",0
That my 2019 went up in smoke and to this day they have no idea why and they are not investigating why it happen. Thank god I was not driving and they have the worst customer service. No one gets back to you.,0
"I am a lifelong Jeep owner. Only ever had 2 cars that were not Jeeps. Always been a big fan, until my last two. I have had nothing but problems with my last two cars, which were purchased new. The defects have been ongoing since purchase. They have all kinds of electrical problems, all warning lights coming on for no reason at all, including the check engine light. The car will often not start or turn over at all, even though all the lights come on when I turn the key. The back gate on my last Jeep snapped for no reason at all. They fixed it 4 times and each time it would snap again immediately after being fixed. When I take the car in for service they tell me they can find nothing wrong, over and over again. I even have video, but it does me no good. They know that Jeeps keep selling, so they do nothing to help. After repeatedly taking my Jeep in for service and getting no help, I am selling it and will not buy a Jeep again. It is 2 years old.",0
"I travel a lot and had my oil changed out of state. Come to find out the dealership didn’t seal my oil filter properly and has been dripping oil. I contact the dealership in Albany Ny to only find out they want me to drive 3 hours to have my oil changed there again. First off why would I go back when they did it wrong the first time. Secondly it’s a 3-hour drive with dripping oil. So I contact Jeep directly only to find out there is absolutely nothing they can do for me. Seriously, I have had owned other cars and dealerships have always been great offering any help in anyway. All I’m looking for is 1 free oil change so I don’t have to pay $150 in a month for 2 oil changes. I’m really starting to rethink buying a Jeep. Especially knowing how they can't help me at all. They couldn’t even get a hold of the dealership to even speak to them. That right there should tell you how great they are. If I could have given it a zero or even lower I would have.",0
"I was one of the very first to sign up and order an all new Jeep Gladiator Launch Edition. It has been a botched launch ever since the beginning. The website pre-order not working correctly, promised a ""white glove"" concierge experience with no contact from them, the factory pumping out Jeeps for orders that were placed months after mine, and now delivery...As I type this it sits in a lot waiting on truck to bring it two hours to the dealership..for an entire month it has been sitting there. The chat is of no help and my salesman says FCA won't let him send someone just to pick it up. Starting to wonder why I am buying this if this is how Jeep treats its customers.",0
"Jeep Extended Warranty Scam! If you just bought a New Jeep and you opt for the Lifetime Warranty then you have just been SCAMMED! Here is what happened to me, to prove my point. I bought a New 2017 Jeep Renegade on Jan 2018. After some thought and searching for an Extended Vehicle Protection plan, I decide to go with Mopar’s Vehicle Protection (MVP). So, I called Mopar, and the salesman told me that as soon as the Manufacturer Warranty ends then, the Extended Warranty would kick in!
      Well, Folks, This Was a Major Lie! The salesman NEVER said that this replaces your Manufacturer Warranty the Day that you buy it! AND it will automatically insert itself back to the date that you bought the vehicle! So, basically, you are paying for the Manufacturer Warranty! How stupid do I feel? I feel very stupid at this point! Who in their right mind would pay for a warranty that is FREE for 5 years? I know if I was told that this warranty would take the place of the Manufacturer Warranty from the time you bought it, I would say, “Hell-NO!” This is a Major SCAM People!So, I called Mopar (800-521-9922) and asked to speak to Admin to tried to explain that the Salesman at Mopar lied to me by not telling me that this Warranty would run Concurrent with the Manufacturer Warranty (Take its place) and that I would be paying for my warranty from the get-go! Now I don’t know about you folks, but who in their right mind would pay for something that is given to them for FREE? So, I tried to explain this to “Danu”. I don’t know the spelling of his name, but that is how he said it when I talked to him on June 28, 2019, @ 12 PM Mtz. He told me that this is correct and that I will get a refund back minus $1000 for the time that I was on this Extended Warranty Protection plan from Mopar, even though, Mopar (Jeep) was already given me for 5 year or 60,000 miles for free! I asked to speak to a supervisor of Manager and he said there isn’t any and then transfer me to a survey on how well this call went! LOL, of course, I gave the LOWEST possible score that I could give him! And, I kissed my $1000 goodbye! Needless to say, Jeep has just put another unhappy customer on the street to tell the masses what is going on behind the curtain of deception! So, people if you feel like being SCAMMED And throwing your money down the ** then just opt into the Jeep Lifetime Warranty Program!

"I have been dealing with many ongoing issues with my 2006 Jeep Commander 3.7 6 cylinder. I have called them & emailed the company on several occasions about my dash lights just coming on & losing all power as I am driving. It's very scary because I always have my 13 yr old in the vehicle. No code comes up on the scanner when I have brought it in several times to the garage. Jeep Chrysler says they have not heard of this issue. I have found many many people with this issue online. Very discouraged with the same issue. There is so many wires & control panels in this vehicle it makes me nervous that some of these wires are fried & nobody can find it. 
      I am exhausted with paying out of pocket with this vehicle. Yes it's a 2006 but I can not afford anything else & I have had it for 5 yrs now. These issues started about 1 1/2-2 yrs ago. I loved this vehicle & with me driving everywhere for my daughters sports it's worked. Now I get nervous & I don't trust it. Which makes me very sad. This vehicle has made me stopped doing stuff that I used to. That's no way to live. I love Jeeps but this is making me not want to buy a Jeep again. It's something I can't keep putting money into. The issue I also have is the service engine light. That's the catalytic converter. My mechanic told me to check with Jeep because it is something well known for breaking in them & there could be a recall. I did check & again they didn't know what I was talking about. This is the 2nd converter I've put in the vehicle in 5 yrs. The paperwork from the 1 previous owner had also done it 2 yrs before I purchased it in 2014. Which in my previous vehicle that I had for 10 yrs not once did I put a catalytic converter in. After reviewing several reviews from Jeep Commander owners I decided to write a review out of frustration. I really would like to think Jeep would do the right thing especially with our kids always in our vehicle & future Jeep buyers deciding to not buy another Jeep. Thank you.",0
"My husband and I have been lifelong Jeep owners, until now. We decided to upgrade our 2013 2 door Freedom Edition to a 2019 Mojito Wrangler 4 door Rubicon. We special ordered it exactly the way we wanted. Spent months researching and looking at Jeeps so that we would get the perfect car. We sold our 2013 outright about 2 weeks before ours was delivered. We waited almost a month for it to come into the dealer. Not ideal but ok it takes awhile to put a car together right? Dealer finally called us and we drove two hours to pick up our new toy. It was pouring when we got there which was disappointing, but now looking back that was a godsend.
      During inspection we found scratches all over interior panels, and spots on the doorsills where the paint was chipped down to bare metal. Could get over that.Then during the test drive the car pulled to the right, and had thunking noise upon breaking, along with huge dent in the steering wheel at the top right where you put your hand. (We're told it was a manufacturer defect.) But the final straw was when we pulled it in and found the Sky One roof leaking in the back and discovered the carpet in the back was soaked. Further inspection found that on the passenger side the Sky One roof was not smooth but wrinkled and had a piece of the frame/metal pushing up thru it. For an almost $60,000 vehicle this was not acceptable and we did not take delivery of what was supposed to be our dream Jeep. It was heartbreaking to us as we were so excited to get this car. Dealer tried to place an order for another car but it is no longer available to order. What????Now we are dealing with Jeep Cares. (Really should be called something else.) Two weeks of the runaround of someone will call you - no calls, we assigned a manager they will call - no call. You get the picture. Now finally after many hours on the phone someone finally called us. What we have been offered is talk to your dealer and have them place an order - well they can't. Then we can fix the car they have and you can have that one. Why in the world would I want a car with 8 miles on it that has to be taken apart and rebuilt to fix issues that should never have been there. This feels like they just want to pass off the problems to us; because let's be real here... there will be nothing but problems with a vehicle like this.We have searched other dealers nationwide and have not been able to find a Jeep dealer with the color and options that we wanted; they either have $5,000 more of options or are missing options that are important to us. Final piece is during the time this has all taken we have had two incentives from Jeep expire with no way of recouping the $1,500 for those offered either. At this point we are waiting for them to come up with something other than accepting a Jeep that is subpar. Overall not a great experience not anything that would make me want to do this ever again with Jeep.",0
"Jeep does not takes care of their customer in all fairness. I purchase a 2016 Jeep Renegade Latitude back in November 2016 at Suresky in Goshen NY. In the beginning of 2018 I started getting an issue with my car. I had oil consumption issue. Engine light would come on and the car would feel like as if it’s going to shutdown. Every time I would take to get my oil change, the mechanic would tell me that I have barely have any oil. So I took it to where I purchase the car and explained to them that my issues are with my car. So they did their inspection and testing and at the end they told me that the oil consumption was normal. Mind you I had 45,995 miles and still under warranty. 
      April 29 2019 my car started blowing white smoke out of my tailpipe. Was unable to drive the vehicle home. Following day I took it to the nearest Jeep dealer around my job Croton Auto Park, Croton on Hudson, NY. They did a diagnostic and found #3 cylinder misfires, all my spark plugs are full of oil, a piece of spark plug was found inside the engine and a piece of the piston was to found inside the engine. I called the Jeep FCA opened a case. One of the representatives that helped me open my case told me that my issue with my car was common. She has handled a few of the same issues. The service Manager at the Croton Auto Park also told me that these are very common with the model of my car. I was told that to fix the car it would cost $12,000.00 and the Jeep were only willing to pay $8000 and I have to come up with the other $4000 out of pocket.  Now I am 67,000 miles (7000) over the warranty and was told that this is their last offer. I believe that I should not have to pay for any of this because if this was addressed when I brought it in the day that I was still covered under warranty and below the mileage I wouldn’t need to pay anything. This is a manufacture defect. A 2 1/2 year old car having this kind of issues is unheard of. I provided proof of maintenance records. I am a loyal customer with Jeep. I had a 2003 and 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 2016 Jeep Wrangler and now 2018 Jeep Renegade Latitude. I have never had a bad experience with Jeep till now. This is the worst experience I ever had. I am going to continue to post all this in all social media until I am heard and acknowledge.",0
"My husband and I bought a 2017 Jeep Renegade Trailhawk the year it came out. Since then, we've had several issues pop up. One of the major issues is that the car is sluggish and won't accelerate fast enough. There's an under-powered engine and a transmission that's clunky and seems to jump gears. For example: When the car slows down it jumps gears. I can foresee that this could be a major safety issue at some point.
      At about 20,000 miles or so, we had to bring the Jeep into the dealership to get fixed because the remote start wouldn't work properly, the paint was already chipping off of the Trailhawk emblem and the seatbelt wasn't installed properly and was clicking. Jeep had this car priced at around $30,000 with all of these issues. My husband and I wanted to trade in the Jeep and they were only going to offer a trade in amount of about $15,000. My father always said that a car is nothing but a pit to throw your money in. Some pits are a lot deeper (cough cough: JEEP!). And this one you're better off just passing by.",0
"We bought a 2018 Jeep Wrangler. The Stabilizer shock went out at about 6,000 miles. The rear end went completely out at 12k miles. Never been off-roading either. Been at the shop for two months now. Cannot get parts. Keep getting the runaround and parts not expected for another two months. Got a Wrangler rental, stabilizer shock went out at 6500 miles on the rental... I wish I could get my money back. I do not recommend them at all.",0
"I got a 2018 Jeep Wrangler that is trailer rated. I paid $42,000 for it for the fact that I like to go off road. On New Year's Eve my wife was coming home in a downpour on the highway when the jeep just stop running. She pulled over to get out of the way. She tried starting it a couple of times and nothing. I went and picked her up 150 miles away and had it towed to my house. I called the dealer and had to wait 14 days before they could look at it.
      Two days later I got a call that water got into the motor and it would be $12,000 for a new one. I asked what about my 7 year 100 mile warrant they said it is not covered. I called Chrysler and they said no good. I looked up what trail rated stood for and it said that the jeep could go in water up to 19 to 30 inches. When I said that to them they said that does not mean rain. So to fix my jeep I had to go through my insurance. I will never buy a Chrysler again and have told my friends not to use that dealer or buy a Chrysler. P.s. I work in a company where there 46,000 employees and I posted this on their website.",0
"I leased a 2018 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk in February 2018. 2 months later I had to take it back to dealer for the paint peeling. Of course they were asking me stupid questions... Maybe it's the sun?? Maybe it's from a carwash... really??? It's a defect.... THEN... it started jerking. I would come to a stop sign or a red light and it would jerk upon acceleration. One time I actually thought someone had hit me from behind. Took it back to dealer... can’t find anything wrong... Then last month I took it to another dealer... they found a cylinder misfiring... yeah sounds safe to me. Started doing it again after getting the car back for 3 days. Dropped it off again and they once again find nothing wrong. I will NEVER buy another Jeep product. I just want OUT Of this lease... Oh, and by the way... I have 8800 miles on it.",0
"In Jan my Jeep Patriot with 13,000 miles suddenly stopped on the highway. Dealer could not find a problem. On March 3, a 150 miles from home, it happened again. Nearly got crushed by a tractor trailer. Engine light came on. Had it towed the nearest Jeep dealer. Had to rent a car to get home. After three days dealer could not find the problem and suggested I call Jeep customer service. I did on March 6th. Customer service gave case # **. Said they would assign the problem to a case manager and she would call me on March 7th. 
      I would also get an email from them confirming case number and their agreement to pay for the rental car. Neither happened on March 7th. I have called customer service 4 times since then and left messages for the case manager to call me. No callback. I emailed the Jeep executive office on March 8 to ask for help. No response. The dealer still has my car a 150 miles from home. It is now 10 days. I would suggest you think twice before buying a Jeep.",0
"I bought a new 2018 Jeep Renegade. At three months/4,200 miles it kept stalling out. I called the dealership for suggestions. They stated that I needed to check my oil level. I was very confused by that being a new vehicle. It was over 5 quarts low!! No check engine or oil lights ever came on at any time! How is that possible?! How long have I been driving without oil in my engine? After some online research, I am seeing this has been a big issue with this model with no recalls. NOT ACCEPTABLE!! Buyers beware!!!",0
"I own a 2010 Jeep Liberty with the sky slider roof- reason I bought the car! It is broken & Jeep has stopped making parts to fix! Shame on Jeep for not supporting their product! I have contacted Jeep but they tell me to look in salvage yards- REALLY? I have searched for parts to no avail! My vehicle is 8 years old, low mileage & in great shape except for the main attraction- the sky slider! Therefore making the car worthlessness!",0
"My 2019 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk with 19,000 miles on was great right up until the Power Transfer Unit failed which in turn cause the transmission to catastrophically fail. Jeep is refusing to cover the $13,000 repair bill under warranty. As I was coming to a stop at a rural intersection, I got hung up on a small snow drift. After about 30 minutes of getting in and out of the car while trying all the different 4x4 modes and shoveling, everything exploded. By exploded, I mean I was picking up shrapnel off the ground and transmission fluid was pouring out. This happened while the transmission temp gauge was no higher than 180f. 
      When a person is stuck in the snow, it usually requires spinning the tires a bit, trying to go both forward & reverse, etc. I won't say I was babying the Cherokee, because I wasn't, but I was not revving it up to redline or being overly hard on it. Jeep of course is trying to say it's all my fault but as of this moment, they have not released any specific details to me on exactly how it was my fault or what the criteria is for it being my fault. I do know that after buying a brand new $40,000 Jeep vehicle, I won't ever buy an FCA product again. Don't believe the ""all weather capable"" hype, the photos I have prove that it isn't!",0
"This is the third car I own, my first two cars were Honda and now I am currently driving a 2018 Jeep Compass. I have been driving this car since August, on 2/26/19 around 1:30pm I was driving for about 2 minutes when I stopped at a red light and my automatic stop/start turned my car off, I pressed the button and my car started again normally. As the light turned green I moved my foot from the break to the gas and my car did not move. I pressed the auto again and I still did not move, continued to put my car in park and nothing would work. I had to restart my car twice before it would move. This all happened while at a green light with cars behind me. 
      On 2/27/19 at 2:45pm I started my car and while I was still driving pressed the auto stop/start, I get about 200 feet further before my car starts slowing down on its own and shut off. I waited some time before restarting my car. On 3/1/19 at 2:30pm I did not have auto stop/start on, I was driving for some time and my car started to slow down again so I pushed on the gas to accelerate, it would not accelerate and I was able to pull over to the side when my car came to a stop on its own and the emergency break light came on on its own. I waited some time again before restarting my car. I do not feel safe driving this car as it is dangerous to just stop on its own. **Please note the vehicle has approximately 2965 miles on it as of 3/2/19.",0
I have a terrible experience with this car. I bought it with 17000 miles on it a year ago and had only been able to put 3000 miles on it due the I can’t use it because it has to be covered every time it rains or all the interior will get over a gallon of water. I had called multiple times Spartanburg Jeep dealer for help or a warranty and they just ignore me.,0

We know of 2 other people who own the same vehicle and both had to have their thermostats replaced at similar mileage, so INDEFINITELY A KNOWN PROBLEM. After a 45 day wait they call and tell me that my claim is denied because I am out of warranty. Obviously I told them that from the get go, so why have me file a claim? Also, back door handle fell off. What a piece of junk! We bought this vehicle new. We've always bought Hondas and other than oil changes, brakes and new tires we've never spent a penny on repairs.

In 2.5 years it has required: a new computer, new AC, new transmission and the thingy that helps with a flat tire does not work, so I had to buy a spare. A conservative estimate of the work needed is about $10,000. I had to cover $2,000 of it myself. Never ever not ever would I recommend anyone buy a Jeep.",0
2012 Jeep Liberty Sky rider roof will not stay closed. I took it back to the dealer and they stated that Jeep no longer repairs the Sky Slider roof.

"The customer service provided by Jeep and its affiliated mother company Chrysler is just plain AWFUL!! I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty and the window regulators on my car have broken THIRTEEN times since I've owned the vehicle. Jeep was willing to repair the first 12 and has since refused to offer to pay the $475 it would take to repair the next broken regulator. Would YOU be naive enough to pay $475 dollars for something that happens THIS frequently? How would you feel if Jeep and Chrysler both said they weren't willing to help you? And, suppose another regulator breaks next week - am I expected to pay $475 AGAIN??? My window is currently held in place with masking tape because the motor that powers it suddenly died (thirteenth time!). People can see how easily they can get into my car now.
      The replacement parts are faulty, the service for this takes 3-4 hours at a time, and I've never once gotten an ""I'm sorry"" or a ""thank you for your patience."" You do the math - that's 36-48 hours of my life WASTED on THE SAME ISSUE. My time means nothing to these companies and neither will yours. Chrysler doesn't care about you. They've been giving me any excuse they can find to NOT help me! And Jeep has been no help since the issue should have been fixed during THE FIRST REPAIR! My most recent regulator issue broke on 4/7/17 and I've been arguing with Chrysler and Jeep for TWO MONTHS because neither of us want to pay for the ** service. Why should I fix it? Why should I keep my car? Why should I ever buy any Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep/Ram products ever again?",0
"I have 2018 a Jeep Cherokee Latitude. Jeep kept cutting off sometimes when I would drive it. When oil gets low motor will shut off. It would stall when making turns. I looked for leaks and didn't find any leaks. I noticed the jeep burns at least 2-3 quarts of oil every 2,000 to 3,000 miles. I called Dealer and Chrysler Corp. They said the same thing. Now I have to fill up with oil between oil changes. Sad, This Jeep burns oil like a old car.",0
"I purchased my Jeep back at the end of August. Off and on, a “electronic stability control service” light would come on. I took it into the dealership and it was diagnosed as a vacuum leak. However, the part they needed was backordered and they didn’t know when they would get it. Although still running and driveable, they could not release it back to me for safety. Since it was under warranty, I was able to get a rental, but only for five days. Only could customer care extend that time period. I waited it out as long as possible driving the wife’s car until it became an issue. 
      I called customer care to make sure I could get the extension and was told a case manager would call me back. 3 weeks later and numerous phone calls, still not a word from customer care. Returned the rental and had to pay the majority out of pocket. Still no Jeep and customer care is silent. Now stuck with a rental car bill for a month old vehicle under warranty with 1,000 miles. I call B/S on that one. I’m pretty sure I’ll be trading in my Jeep if I ever see it again. These guys have terrible customer service and done paying for it.",0
"As another review said, no matter which way you turn it's a dead end.

My car contains mold, I have taken my vehicle in for service 3 times already and every service center tells me there is nothing wrong with my car. During this time my car is in service, I had to rent a car (at my expense) because Jeep will not provide me with a loaner. I have been in and out of service centers since August. 
      As the time goes by the smell is getting stronger and stronger. It has come to a point where I cannot even use the car. Mold is a health hazard and I will not put myself nor my children at a health risk! I do not want this car! I want to cancel my lease agreement and not have to deal with Jeep ever again! This is experience has become a nightmare from Hell! I don't know who else to call at this point! At this point, I will take legal action and file a lawsuit against Jeep!",0
"To Whom It May Concern, I’m writing this letter to voice our frustrations with the Jeep brand, and express our concerns for other owners of the 2013-present day Jeep Cherokee. In July of 2017, my now fiancé purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk 4x4 from Ramsey Motors in Riverside, MO. The vehicle at the time had roughly 24, ** miles, it was a one owner vehicle originally purchased new from Gladstone DCJ & R in 2015.
      On approximately June 18th-19th, the car would not start for my fiancé to make her commute to work. She found a ride, and I had MOPAR roadside assistance tow the vehicle to Stateline CDJ&R of Kansas City for diagnosis. On June 21th, a representative of Stateline called to tell me a PRNDL switch was the root of our issue and quoted me to replace. I protested, believing the issue to be caused by a failing alternator, however being ”highly qualified technicians” I agreed, and Stateline followed through with the service. We picked the car up from Stateline on 6/29/18.The morning on 6/30/18 (yes the next day!) the car failed to start at a gas station in Pittsburg, KS, I instructed my fiancé to take the vehicle to Jay Hatfield DCJ&R in Frontenac, KS. A diagnosis by the service tech that day suggested… a failing alternator! Jay Hatfield apologized for the Stateline’s mistake, quoted me to repair, and promised the car returned to us by the end of the following week.The next few days were spent communicating with and agreeing to a 50% refund of our service fees done by Stateline, we picked the vehicle back up from Jay Hatfield on 7/6/18, I replaced the battery as a precaution the next day. 19 days, 2 dealerships, over $1,500.00 out of pocket, we finally had our vehicle back and felt comfortable with it again. How wrong was I!In early September, the vehicle failed to start on several occasions. Being that Jay Hatfield last had their hands on it, and frankly I found them to be honest and straightforward gentlemen, we made the 100 mile trip back to Jay Hatfield with the vehicle for a 2nd diagnosis. Jay Hatfield kept the vehicle for about 4 days, repeatedly stated to me the vehicle started each time they tried, and returned it to me. I felt like the boy who cried wolf! Are these service departs downright over and done with me? We’re not crazy, the vehicle is malfunctioning, we don’t drive 100 miles for a service appointment for fun & games.We made it through the next 30 days or so without an issue, until the morning of 10/10/18. While leaving a doctor’s appointment and going to work, the car died on my fiancé in traffic. A complete loss of power to the vehicle, no dash lights, no acceleration, nothing. The vehicle was pushed out of traffic, eventually regained power on its own, and driven home where now it sits dead in the driveway. Emergency lights are nice to have when a vehicle is stalled in traffic, my fiancé was not afforded this luxury!This is the final straw, it is clear as day that Chrysler/Jeep builds an inferior product, and maintains inferior means of training technicians to diagnose the very vehicles they sell to the public. The vehicle is nothing more than a $32,000 lawn ornament. Bringing me to the purpose of this letter, as stated above, we are collectively through with CDJ&R vehicles we want nothing to do with this Jeep Cherokee. I am writing with hope that somebody of purpose takes notice, and chooses to take the extra steps to address a customer’s complaint even when their technician is stumped. It is clear there is a deep electrical issue with these vehicles that needs to be investigated. A stalling vehicle in traffic, and subsequently pushing it out of traffic in the rain is a terrifying, extremely unsafe, and completely avoidable situation. I urge you all to take this into consideration when the inevitable “next one” arrives on your doorstep, hopefully that situation turns out better for the customer. If you have any questions, or wish to discuss this topic further, I can be reached via email or on my cell @ **. Thank you for your time.",0
"On June 7th of this year, and since then I have had to take the Jeep close to ten times. I purchased this Jeep for a rather affordable price compared to other models at the dealership. I soon found out why. Within 24 hours of owning it, the cooling fan stopped working and caused the engine to overheat within seconds of starting the engine. I took it in to the same dealership I bought it from, a certified Jeep one at that, to be repaired and thought that was it. Exactly two weeks later, the check engine light came back on but this time it was because there was a small evap leak with the emissions system. They repaired it and assured me everything was fine. A week later the light came back on and I was told the fuel tank pressure sensor was faulty. Once again that was taken care of and they said everything was fine. 
      Yet another week went by and the light was back on. The same sensor they replaced the week prior was also faulty. They replaced this and I was hoping everything was finally done having issues. That lasted about two weeks when the light came back on. The dealership said it was being caused by the emissions system, which at this point they had completely replaced the module, but everything was fine. No leaks, no faulty sensors. The light was just on. They cleared it and a week later the light was back on. Only after all this was my Jeep's issues being taken up with Chrysler. I was told that if the light came back on, don't even bother taking it in, just keep driving it like normal. I wasn't having that since the light coming on could have been caused by anything.The final straw was when I was trying to make a left turn in a busy intersection. I pressed on the gas and could hear the engine revving but the car was not moving forward aside from the normal rolling that happens. I took the Jeep in the next morning and they said it had to do with the ABS system needing an update. I almost was in a car accident over an update? That's unacceptable to me. I cannot wait to be rid of this vehicle as I no longer feel safe driving it and I have grown tired of constantly needing to take it in.",0
"I'm experiencing stalling, shuddering and shaking. I was told by a Jeep dealer I need an Electronic throttle control body. Of course they whipped out the cost but not the solution. They let me leave with the car like that. The next day I received a lightning bolt warning signal and the car stalled in traffic jerked forward and continued moving slowing in ongoing traffic. This is a safety issue and I advise other owners with these problems to report them.",0
"Bought a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee, it was leaking oil and shutting off on the highway. They replaced the whole engine after 24,000 miles, now at 47,000 miles it needs a second engine. Can you imagine to replace 2 engines before it hits 50,000 miles. A complete disaster and failure for the so called JEEP.",0
"From the moment I purchased this vehicle I have had nothing but problems, constantly. I bought it new off the lot in 2011 and paid an extra $5k for the warranty. Every few months I have to take it to the dealer for repairs: Twice for exhaust leaks caused by broken exhaust bolts, fuel pump, radiator, water pump, rack and pinion, drive shaft, twice for inside fan blower, left motor mount twice, right motor mount, 8! times and counting for a vibration that cannot be determined, even after an engineer from Chrysler flew out, 2 a/c condensers, spark plug coil, exhaust manifold, rear light cover melted from poor design, air conditioning lines, play in the transmission, oil pan replaced... I mean the list goes on. The kicker is that I have never once even taken this vehicle off road. The bottom is spotless!
      After endless hours on the phone constantly I have yet to receive anyone at Jeep who wants to resolve the issue. The offered me a CDI number for employee pricing, when I went into the dealership to explore the sales guy laughed at me and told me he has way better deals. I would discourage anyone from buying a Jeep ever. All my friends, family, and coworkers have a running joke about me and my Jeep. So sad, especially when Chrysler was bailed out billions of our tax payer money! In addition, I am a disabled service connected veteran of the US Air Force. And this is how I am treated by a company that touts their support of vets! Beyond disappointed.",0
"Just hit 22,000 miles on my new 2017 Jeep Willys, only highway driving, less than two years old. The factory installed tires are in need of replacement. If you are planning on buying a one then request that the factory installed tires are replaced with a more reliable tire. A couple donuts from Dunkin' would last longer than the factory installed tires.",0
"It's hard to explain it all but in a nutshell -- Jeep doesn't stand behind their product and their customer service is a disservice. In June 2018, my Liberty roof got stuck open. The local dealer was helpful in getting the roof closed but said the part to repair it was back ordered 48 weeks. When the roof started to leak a bit more, I called Jeep/Chrysler to find a solution. OMG. Useless people and baloney answers. The part is in manufacturing. I said, ""Good. How many are you  shipping next week?"" ""IDK"". ""How many Jeeps did you produce with a sky slider roof?"" ""IDK"". ""A case manager will call you back."" Oh that is not my dealership.
      They should be ashamed of themselves to not support a car that is only 8 yrs old and allow the interior to ruined by the rain and not offer a viable solution to protect your investment. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND A JEEP PRODUCT AGAIN and I have had several. Buy a TOYOTA!!! or Hyundai --my second car is GREAT!",0
"Particulate filter, catalytic converter, broken grommet, etc. - I am going on day 70 without my Jeep Grand Cherokee. 3 months of payments, no car. 3 months of Sirius radio payments, no car. Have heard the part is on back order for many months-Today called the Chrysler number and he said he sent messages but the service tech hasn't responded. 1st they put a new employee on my case. TWO days on the job. Come on guys. Really? Not fair to him or me. 2nd His response: “I will call the dealer and see if the part is there.” Duh dude-NO it is not there. (Oh wait, they forgot to give it to the tech). Then we had a tremendous exhaust leak into the cabin of my car. Car smoking like crazy. How do I file for Lemon Law?",0
"Bought the car in 2003, a year old. I wanted a good road car for work and a Jeep for weekends. This car was and is both. Very little trouble. 160,000 miles on original motor and transmission. A few minor problems but overall a great car. Really a great highway car and also great for camping. If the weather is really bad the dog and I can sleep in the back. I am writing because I see that Land Rover has a line of dog accessories. I rescue old, sick dogs, no one else wants. They are nice dogs and we have a good time. As they get old it gets harder for them to get in the Jeep. I cannot find a ramp that they like. I put cheap AstroTurf in the back and would not mind buying a mat that fit. I guess that is it. Happy customer.",1
"The retractable roof broke and will not close completely... Contacted the dealer and was told it would take a month to get the pieces... That month is now going on five... Was given a number by the dealership to call and put in a complaint. Now I have a case number and a woman who calls me every week telling me they are working on rectifying the problem. I was told today that they are unable to make the replacement pieces at this time because the ""mold"" for the piece was lost... So now they are in the process of trying to find a manufacturer to make the ""mold"" to make the piece... then make sure it is safe for the public. REALLY... I call BS. They need to take this car back and return my money. This cannot be legal. 
      I am making car payments on a car I cannot drive safely... Do they not realize God forbid someone drives their car like this and gets into an accident and is ejected from the car and dies because of a faulty roof. Lawsuits up the butt... This is just ridiculous. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER JEEP EVER. This is such bad business on their part... and I will tell anyone who listens to me to never ever buy a Jee. They should be ashamed of themselves.",0
"After having a tiny fender bender, or flair bender in this case my car needed to have some minor work done. After waiting a month for parts I decided I was tired of waiting. I was going to be proactive and go above the body shop to see if I could get any help. After contacting several dealers who could not answer the simplest questions about the parts, I decided to call Jeep on my own. I used both the listed contact email and phone number from their website. After being put on intergalactic hold on 1st call, hung up on when I asked to speak to a mgr on the 2nd call, the third call and 3 hours of time actually let me start a case claim. I was told their “excellent “ customer service dept would get back to me within 48 hrs. That’s not excellent when you are having issues that have already taken a month to be addressed. I have to be honest when I say I couldn’t wait the 48 hrs and called back after 24. 
      Again given a scripted runaround statement or “FACTS” as they called it and told that I could keep waiting for my case person to contact me but they were not going to tell me anything different than what she did. Her name was SHAY and she supposedly is the end all be all of customer service at Jeep. She has no boss, no training personnel, or any other contact information to give you. No way to even report the fact that she was extremely belittling. So that’s it! Final answer! Do not pass go do not collect 200 bucks. So in short I have been left in a perpetual waiting period, for some parts out there in the universe. They may come in they may not. And as for as Jeep is concerned I don’t think they care one bit if you were happy with your purchase, happy with their customer service or about you at all. They will NOT stand behind their brand, or give you any assistance once you drive that car off the lot. I’d be happy to speak with anyone at Jeep other than the call center people who I feel were not only unhelpful but downright rude... But I’m not holding my breath.",0
"I ordered a Trackhawk when they became available and received it November 29th and was present when it rolled off the truck. It has been everything I expected. It is quick, reliable, very well constructed inside and out. My wife and I took it on a road trip from Kansas City to Seattle area and back and really enjoyed the way it performed and handled. Very easy to drive and use all of the options. It is sure footed in poor road conditions and easy to drive in traffic. This is the ultimate sleeper vehicle. I also own a 15 Viper which is also fun and more than capable of outperforming almost anything on the road and also well put together.",1
My 2016 Jeep Renegade shut off while driving home from work at 9:30pm. It was dark and raining. There was no shoulder to even coast too. I could have been injured if I got hit. I am scared to death to drive my Jeep because I’m terrified this will happen again. Turns out there was no oil in Jeep. Why? I ask. I just had an oil change not even 700 miles ago. I’m already down a quart or more so now what?,0
My 2006 Jeep Commander is nice and big with 3rd row seat. Great for my big family. Has enough room for everyone to have drinks. I like that my daughter can charge her phone in the 3rd row seat. Leg space for everyone is also good. Overall a very good buy and I am very pleased with it. It has everything I was looking for. If I ever have to buy another car I will be sure to get another Jeep Commander.,1
"I just bought the Jeep Liberty a few weeks ago. I like its automatic windows, 4 wheel drive and the back opens up either just the glass or the glass and the door. And the door actually opens up to the side not downward. However, I would change the outer appearance. I wish the body shape wasn't so round and compact. I don't like the super boxy look either but somewhere between this style and the boxy style would be perfect. But other than that, I love this vehicle. It's a 2006 with 141,000 miles on it, runs like a champ and looks like it's brand new practically.",1
"Jeep Compass is good on gas. I am glad I picked this type of car. It is reasonably priced for an SUV. It has great stereo and the speakers work well. I like the Bluetooth that came with it. It's nice to be hands free. Moreover, the air conditioning works great. The Compass is great, but I wish it had more leg room and reverse camera. It would be a great safety feature. Also, I'd like it if the front window and side front windows had a bit more tint.",1
"With less than 3,000 miles my trans (2018 Jeep Compass Limited 4x4) malfunctioned while on the expressway. I lost all power to the engine. Thankfully I was able to exit safely. Towed for service to the dealership. Valve body harness replaced and said it was good to go. Driving home from the dealership it wasn't shifting correctly and eventually had no gears at all and need to be towed back the next day. My car got a new transmission. The next problem was the front windows wouldn't roll down. Back for service, a corroded module inside the door was the problem. No explanation as to how or why this happened other than it must of been installed that way. 
      Picked up car the next day and while driving home my HVAC would not switch modes, and the navigation system came up without prompting, returned within 10 minutes from pick up and back in for service. It's been in the repair shop 4x in less than a month and currently in for a week today with latest electrical issue. Thankfully my service department is backing me when I say this car needs to be taken back and I'm currently working with my dealership to make this happen. I have zero confidence in its dependability and am afraid to drive it.",0
"I've always owned cars and I love SUVs. This Jeep Liberty has good gas mileage but had horrible suspension. Engine had to be replaced ball joints twice and locks keep malfunctioning. It does go good in the winter and four wheel drive is tricky but when you get it it works good. Price and the body style was also nice. It is roomy, convenient and I like the color, too. But a CD player, better engines and a better suspension would be nice. And fix the four wheel drive as well.",0
"I've had an overall decent experience. I don't love the Jeep but it's reliable enough. The Jeep's design and features are very appealing. It has heated seats, a sunroof, a lot of extras, and it's nice to look at. There are also chrome rims. It connects my phone through the radio too. It's durable but I bought it certified from the dealer and as soon as the warranty expired I feel like I keep having to replace parts. I've had a lot of little mechanical issues go wrong as well. Also, when my teenagers sit in the back there isn't much leg room and I can't seem to have enough space to bring things. Our leather seats also get cold in the winter, and have some tiny tears now.",0
"Jeep has always been a reliable brand and I love my Renegade. The interior is super roomy and very comfortable. This model also includes a fair amount of cargo space. The only features missing from this particular model are no hatchback and its lack of a cargo hitch. It'd be quite useful to be able to haul a small trailer if need be, as we have motorcycles that sometimes need hauled. But other than that, the safety features are great. As a parent, it makes me much more confident knowing my daughter is the safest she can be. The Jeep Renegade drives very smooth and it's a comfort to know that when the weather turns snowy, that 4-wheel drive can save you.",1
"I was very disappointed cause my Jeep needs a new engine. It has a blown head gasket after 3 months of me owning it and the seller cut the 4 wheel drive shaft out. I wish I could have brought it to a garage to have it looked over cause then I would have had the opportunity to say no or gotten it cheaper or had the seller fix it. He just plainly ripped me off for like 2000. It's just not worth putting that kind of money in it. I also didn't like the center console. It has the window controls there instead of by the window like on the door panel. Even so, I liked the fact that it was an SUV but wasn't huge. It had plenty of space and seemed to have run great. Was also pretty easy to work on and maintain but I didn't really get to drive it all that much.",0
"I have great experience with my Jeep Compass. Good on gas, handles well in bad weather, it is a four cylinder engine, and comfortable. Get good gas mileage and parts are fairly affordable, too. It has heated seats, also has four wheel drive, very roomy for size of vehicle, has built in CD player and design is with customer comfort in mind, overall appearance of the vehicle catches the eye and it has a smaller engine which is fuel economy but has the power to get thru anything. However, the Jeep should have a bigger trunk or storage area or should come with a compartment on top of rack for better storage of road side equipment and car maintenance.",1
I purchased a 2017 Jeep Renegade in April 2018. The car died on me and shut itself down while in motion 3 times. The car was diagnosed with a fuel pump issue. I have now been without my vehicle for 3 weeks and the part will not be released for at least another 3. Jeep will not provide me with a loaner or rental until my vehicle is repaired and if I pay for one myself I won't be reimbursed. So basically buying a Jeep with a manufacturer defect is just my bad luck. Customer service at Jeep has been condescending and frustrating. I will never again buy a Jeep and will inform everyone of my problems with the car and the company.,0
"I love my Jeep Renegade but I wish it had more features. The dealer did not know anything about the Jeep and was very misleading. I was upset once I signed the paperwork. I should've test drive it as well. Don't have Uconnect and the dealer led me to believe I would. I also would improve the price. I still think I was paying for the name Jeep and overpaid on the car. Nevertheless, having a Remote start is by far the best. I Love starting it 10 mins before I leave in the morning remotely. I also love power windows and having tire pressure gauges.",1
"This is the first Jeep product I have owned and so far, I am really happy with my purchase. The Jeep dealership was super. Great service and friendly staff. I can see all of my future vehicle purchases being Jeep products also. My only problem I have encountered is that my kids are way too close to me and each other. I'm used to a minivan and the distance between us makes long drive a more bearable. Lol. But other than that, I like that the Jeep Renegade is at a very fair price. I also like the touchscreen stereo, which is standard in most vehicles these days but still appealing to me.",1
"My Jeep Patriot is good and reliable. I drive easily to work every day, over 50 miles, and get around on my rural gravel roads, which can get really wet or slick in the winter and spring, and don't always get plowed quickly. Plus they are hilly, so I need 4 wheel drive often after bad weather. The engine is good, but not very powerful. I would like to feel a bit more power when I press the gas pedal. I also got bigger tires for my jeep, as the original tires were kind of small, and I wanted more powerful looking tires. Other than that, I like that it's an SUV, a 4 wheel drive, has lots of room in hatch, leather seats and is comfortable. I really wanted a Jeep, as I had a Jeep in the past that I loved, with the classic Jeep look.",1
"I love my Jeep Patriot. It is extremely reliable, and in wonderful condition. Since my car is front wheel drive, it is common for my front tires to skid in the rain if going at a fast speed. I love the color of my vehicle, and the shape of it. The trunk of my car is very spacious, I am able to fit a lot of things back there. Also, the back seat of my car is spacious. I enjoy having cloth seats because it is hot where I live, and leather seats would burn me. The only complaint I have in regards to my vehicle would be concerning the middle seat in the back row. It is uncomfortable to sit in that seat because there is not much space to put your legs. Sometimes I wish the car was a little more technologically updated, but other times I love the simplicity of my car. Less technology, less problems.",1
The Jeep Compass has proved to be good. I have not had any issues with the make or model of the car. The crossover style is good for my current lifestyle and needs. The seats fold in to create extra space for moving or transporting large items. It also allows me to have space and to feel safer on the road because of the size. I dislike the radio that it came with initially. However a new one could be installed easily enough with the proper tools. I also dislike the handles on the backseat doors as they are a little hard to open.,1
The Jeep Patriot is by far one of the best vehicles we have owned. It gets great gas mileage and does awesome in snow. This past Christmas my family went to visit family in Jamestown NY and ran into blizzard like conditions and if it wasn't for the 4 wheel drive I don't know what we would have done. The Patriot had no problems getting us through the snow storm. We like the 4 wheel drive. It gets up and goes with no problems. There's plenty of room for the family and groceries. We like all the other features as well. But we find it hard to look both ways when there's a passenger or you're by yourself and it's hard to see down the road cause of the door frame. Other than that we don't have any complaints. My family loves the Patriot and was sad to hear that they are stop making them.,1
"My Jeep Liberty has been a safe, reliable vehicle that has required only routine maintenance. It's got a great capacity in the rear for its size. Convenient when I've bought small furniture items. I also like the four-wheel drive. We could tow this car behind our RV, and it would support the lift for my husband's mobility scooter without dragging. However, the seats could be more comfortable.",1
"I have had my 2013 Jeep Patriot for almost 5 years now. I like this car because it gets good gas mileage, it has a satellite radio, heated seats, heated mirrors and radio controls on the steering wheel. Also it has a sunroof that I enjoy a lot. I like almost everything about my Jeep Patriot. The only thing I dislike a little is that it is a bit hard to tell how close you are getting to objects. But other than that, it has been a very reliable vehicle and all I have had to do is have it serviced.",1
"Check engine light is a problem and after going to the dealership and paying 500+ to fix the problem, it still came on. I like the car overall but the remote start feature is deactivated when check engine light is on. The radio also doesn't have CD player and only plays sat radio or iPod/phone. The gas mileage isn't that great and could be better. Also, most of the repairs are very costly. Nevertheless, I like the look and color of the vehicle. It has heated seats and remote start which was what I was looking for in a vehicle. The sunroof is an added benefit as well.",0
"The Jeep Patriot Sport is not very good as to being soundproof, the lower seating panel is poor quality, broken off on driver and passenger side while getting off and onto seat, sluggish when pulling off. I would not advise friends and family to purchase this vehicle at all.",0
I bought this Jeep Liberty six years ago used. The car had a little more than one hundred fifty thousand miles on it. Now it's over one hundred ninety thousand miles on it. Great car and good gas mileage. I just got lucky and got a great running vehicle.,1
"I liked this car (Jeep Liberty 2012) more the first year than I do now. I bought it in 2013 for 17,000. I have it serviced every year and this year it cost me over 700 because the brakes were worn. I don't like the steering. But I have arthritis, so that may be the reason why it's hard for me. I plan on trading it in this spring.",0
"I love my little Jeep Liberty. I live in an area where there is a lot of snow in winter and the hills are very steep. It is such a trooper, making it up and down those roads!",1
"Jeep Liberty runs great and fun to drive. Great styling and large cargo area. Good visibility and all around vehicle. However a little noisy. But it is a little older model, New ones may be quieter.",1
"Fun to drive, looks great but this model has issues with the front end parts and the subframe. Have a 2008 Patriot with only 60k miles that has had almost every front end part replaced, if I did not have an extended warranty I would not have been able to afford all the repairs. I always thought Jeeps were good vehicles, but I will never buy another one.",0
Bought a new JL Rubicon from the dealership. 4 days later the handle falls off. Took to dealership. Waited an hour for them to tell me they needed to order parts. Next day go back and they have wrong parts again. Of course after another hour wait. They couldn't even tell me when the parts will be in stock. Just that it's a new model so could take some time.,0
"The jeep (2015 Jeep Cherokee) is currently in the shop for the second brake booster failure. The first one happened little over a year ago at 26k. This one just happened again at 44k. The dealership has had the vehicle for over a week, and they can't seem to get the problem fixed. Last Jeep we will ever own. Jeep customer service is of no use. Both times this thing went out, my son was in the back seat. At this point I have to question the overall safety of the vehicle.",0
"My 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee is a piece of junk. It only has 70,000 miles. Over the last few years I have put all new brakes twice! All new tires, 2 radiators, complete computer panel that blew and almost killed my son and I. A new thermostat... etc! DO NOT BUY A Dodge! I drive 2 miles to work. Terrible car! Service charged me 900$ to replace the radiator.",0
I wanted it reported as I see that this is affecting many many owners of this vehicle with the same issue but no recall has ever been issued. This is a safety issue as you cannot open the doors so if you were in a wreck you cannot access the handle to open the door. I contacted the Jeep company but they said no recall so will not repair.,0
"When I bought this car, nobody told me if I don’t regularly drive long distance on the freeway the soot level will build up and the car breaks down and needs to be towed in for service. My commute is only 5 minutes so I don’t have any need to drive long distances over 60 mph as the car required. I have had it break down three times since 2015. Jeep is very clever at dodging my calls and I can’t get anywhere with them. They have about the worst customer service I’ve ever seen. I’ve been told now three years later the car is not a good match for my driving habits and I have to sell. The value has dropped 23k in the three years I’ve had it. I’ll never buy a Jeep again!",0
"I leased a 2017 Jeep Renegade. Since August 2017 this vehicle has failed to start every time and has been in and out of the shop for more than 40 cumulative days. I am very disappointed in the vehicle and at this point accepted the fact that the vehicle is unreliable. The vehicle has had numerous parts replaced by the dealer (eg. harness, fuel injectors, brake switch, etc). I want other people to know what experience I have had as this has not been a fun ride.",0
I have a 2011 Jeep Liberty Limited. I change oil and everything as required. I noticed it having a little tick in 2015 and took it dealership but it wouldn’t do it on the test drive. Then again in 2016 and they said it was AC kicking in. Well it was a sign of a major problem. It wanted stalled out on me after an hour and in cold weather and then at 140k miles and cold weather engine would not go over 30 mph. Had coil and sensors and plugs change out still didn’t want to get good mileage of take off. Then it started smoking and it was a gasket at 150500 miles. As good as I am with this engine it cost $4000 to put new gasket and catalytic converter on it. Never buy a Jeep again! The engine still wants to die on me but too upside down to trade it in now.,0
"I have a 2009 Jeep Liberty, 2 weeks after I drove it off the lot I noticed that the heater was not working. Took it in and the heater core had blown. Since I had this Jeep it has blown 4 times!!! The dealership (Suncoast located in Florida) and manufacturer will not help with the repairs. How can the same thing malfunction 4 times? How could they not help with the repairs of a part that has malfunctioned 4 times? I was sold a lemon! And will never purchase another Jeep again.",0
"I bought a Jeep in October (2017), not from this location but this is where I brought my car in for repairs. FIRST I NEED TO SAY WARRANTY ISN'T COVERING A WARRANTABLE FIX - let me tell you a bit first... I was leaving for work last Saturday, 3/3/18, and my CV axle/ball joint malfunctioned. I bought my 2015 Jeep Renegade from Centennial location called Prestige Jeep... location (where I will leave a review next) and it was pre-owned. I don't know if this malfunction is due to the vehicle's prior use (clean Carfax though) or due to a bad joint. There were plenty of other Jeep recalls on front drive axles since 2015. Anyhow, I have drive to and from all of my patients' homes, (full-time nurse) and to and from UNLV (full-time student at 18 units!!!!!) and twice to the grocery store and gas each month. 
      That's where I have drive. This is a 2015 Renegade with 14,675 miles on it and the axle/ball joint is malfunctioning and the vehicle is undrivable. I bought extended warranty but don't waste your time and money doing that because not even the Jeep original warranty (5 years/60k miles) won't cover it. Lol and they had the NERVE at the SAHARA location to call me while my vehicle is sitting in their lot unfixed and ask me if I'm interested in purchasing another Jeep LOL!!! UM ** NO. I'M NOT BUYING ANOTHER JEEP OR ANYTHING UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF JEEP/CHRYSLER.",0
I found out today I bought a 2010 Jeep liberty in 2013 had 19000 miles on it. Never was told it had a recall for leaking water pump. Well I have had it for 7 years. I have 35500 miles on it. Now the water pump is shot again. 2 water pumps in less than 8 years. Seems Jeep has a problem that needs to be addressed. I have no problem fixing what goes wrong but I do have a problem with the same thing having to be fixed in a short period of time. And under 50000 miles pretty pathetic. I would never buy another Jeep of any kind. It should still be under some kind of manufacture warranty under 50000 miles. And if there is a problem in this part then Jeep should be responsible in replacing it. Faulty and cheap.,0
Worst buying experience I have ever had. Purchased a new 2017 Jeep Wrangler in April 2017 and it had been in the shop for the same problem. Jeep customer service keep promising they would take care of the matter. To call them when I was at the service department. I did and all I did was waste my time. They did nothing. I was awarded a buyback/repurchase lemon law. Customer service has been no help to me either and 2 months later I'm still awaiting for this to be settled. They do not stand behind their product and their customer service is lacking.,0
"I really enjoy driving the 2017 Jeep Patriot. It's very comfortable, gets good gas mileage, and it handles well in snow. I don't know if I could drive anything but a Jeep now.",1
Never use this company. Very BAD customer service if you can ever get off of hold waiting for them. Changing their name from Frontier to Vantage is not going to fix them. Had to use the Attorney General’s office of MN to get them to respond and admit all their billing errors.,0
"My wife and daughter visiting New Mexico. On way home in 2015 Jeep Renegade on the August 25th had check engine light come on and had to tow vehicle to mechanic who look at vehicle reset light and said all looked fine. Next day just outside Colorado Springs engine light came back on, had vehicle towed again to Faricy Boys dealership, which inspected vehicle and found cooling fan relay bad and would have to order part. Now after weekend Monday was assured would have part by Wed. the 30th at which time was told no part is coming and did not know when part would arrive. Now 5 days later speaking with parts department manager telling me I did not give them enough time to locate part and offered no solution but to wait another 2 days.
      Now my wife's father was being admitted to hospital for heart issues and my daughter starting college that week. With no choice now and could not afford to keep them in Colorado costing already $1200 without food expenses fly them back home to Michigan $850. Now after hours of being on phone with, ""I'm sorry"" and promises a case manager would contact me which during the whole time even the 60 day case review did someone contact me. The people at Faricy Boys felt really bad and after waiting 2 WEEKS TO GET A PART TO FINALLY FIX VEHICLE, Faricy Boys felt bad and tried to get someone from FCA do the right thing and arrange for shipment of vehicle home.Being on Social Security Disability for terminal illness stage 4 cancer this is really wearing on me. Emotionally stressed out and financially draining. Now again wasting time on the phone told me, ""Sorry again. We will have case manager call you back"" which never did. Now I had to pay another $700 to ship vehicle home. Now I was given a number to the office of the president at FCA who was going to supposedly be able to help me recoup some expenses but once again was let down. They have quite the setup with customer service. You will never be able to really speak to anyone of importance. Now after waiting their 60 days for case review they tell me when I called again they did not receive my receipts which I spent another $60 at UPS store emailing and faxing.After resending and calling to make sure they received them which they confirmed they did tried to do the same thing and tell me they did not have them. But during the phone call which like them for quality purposes recorded told her, ""You sure you do not have them because the other women I spoke to said they were in my case file."" Now it was, ""Oh ya. Here they are. I'm sorry. I will again have your case manager call you after review,"" which I told her the 60 days was up. One of the last times I called they had the wrong case number this time then continued to tell me the only receipt she had was one from AutoZone for $86. Enough is enough at this point I was like and this women sympathetic sorry sorry. I would be happy to just get reimbursed for $850 airfare and $700 shipping.After all this I have yet to receive one phone call from FCA to do the right thing. I have been a loyal customer for more than 20 years and currently lease 2 vehicles but they are the last. This 2 dollar part which they did not have is all because this Jeep is made in Italy. They had to take it off assembly line. What a joke. No parts for a vehicle they have been making for several years, and the big thing was always, ""I'm sorry. This part is on back order. You have to wait your turn."" This whole time I tried to get a loaner car. They would not even do that for me. Had to cancel plans going anywhere for holiday weekend, would not even help with loaner. Shame on you FCA. Shame poor customer service. I was hung up on, lied to. Poor way of doing business.",0
New car under 2000 miles returned to the dealer 4x + for the same issue. Dealer cannot fix and Jeep is not standing behind their product. Talked to a rude sr. escalation manager Patricia at Jeep with the resolution team (**) who told me she cannot help any further and is the highest level of support at the Jeep brand. Dealer stated there is nothing more they can do and reached out to Jeep for help. Getting the runaround by Jeep corp and would never buy another Jeep product again. Will pursue local lemon law and NCDS replacement claim. Truly unfortunate that Jeep does not care about their customers or products. Really hard to recommend Jeep to others and suggest they learn how to treat customers and fix their major quality issues.,0
"I bought a Jeep a year ago but it has been the worst investment that the seller made a car with factory problems, the roof with problems of liquefaction. I go four times that they try to fix but always has a different problem. The mechanics have been deteriorating. They put old screws to repair it, they do not put their original parts, to each place that I wear they put a different silicone in it, I lost my love for my car. The truth is that my car has the guarantee but they do not want it answer for my car, if they already realized that the car is not only repaired with silicone and patches. It is best to change the whole piece but Jeep has not returned the call. I think they are waiting for the warranty to end so that dissatisfied customers can not claiming for our rights. It's sad because I thought it was a good company.",0
"My daughter was driving her 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee along with moderate traffic in the left lane of a main road at a speed of 30 mph in a 25 mph area. It was dry with a temperature of about 60 degrees. When the light turned red at an intersection, my daughter applied the brakes to stop, but the car didn't stop. She resorted to slamming on the brakes 2 times and by the 3rd time she slammed the brakes her car crashed full force into the car in front of her pushing the car into the center turning lane. My daughter's car then crashed into the next vehicle which was a box truck. Her airbags did not deploy. My daughter was trapped in her car, but did find a way to get out. 
      I made arrangements for an inspector from Chrysler to go to the body shop to inspect the car to see what may have caused the brakes to malfunction and the airbags to not deploy. Within a few days of the inspection we received a letter from a Mr. ** from Chrysler. The letter was dated the day after the inspection stating that it wasn't a manufacturing responsibility and that all parts operated as designed. Something caused the brakes and airbags to malfunction even though Chrysler won't admit to it. If my daughter would have been going at a higher speed on the freeway, she would have been killed. Chrysler is not returning my phone calls, emails or my certified letter.",0
"I've about had it with this 2006 Jeep Commander nonstop issues and it's never ending money pit. Sunroof leaks, gotten it fixed multiple times. Stalls switching from reverse to drive. Repaired that and it still does it. The right side power steering went, new rack and pin. Massive massive electrical issues, you fix one problem leads to another. The electrical issues don't stop!!! Since it takes hours and hours for the mechanic to pinpoint one electrical problem and that's just to give a quote. Then the car has shut off while turning and other vehicle coming at me, that ignition switch recall supposedly fixed that.
      My mechanic said stop putting money into this. He said the engine is going to go soon. I don't have money to just purchase another vehicle!! We have 4 kids. I can't afford a car payment so keep dumping money into this garbage of a vehicle to keep getting by. What other choice do we have. Jeep should be ashamed and recall all these awful Commanders. Get them off the road!!! Complete unsafe and I have no choice but to drive it.",0
I pick up my new Jeep with the nav sys and it is incomplete. Took back to the dealer which sold to me and was told after a long period that was the nav sys. I would have to live with it.  After 11 Jeep Grands this is the last one. Paid a lot of money for the nav system to get screwed on it. I am stuck with a system that is useless to me!!!,0
"I purchased my 18 year old son a Jeep Renegade two years ago. He recently broke down and the Jeep had been at the local dealer’s for almost two months. The dealer, as well as corporate, are stating they do not have the coolant fan in stock and they are not even manufacturing the parts any longer. I have no vehicle and paying a car payment on this. Very unprofessional and no accommodations are being made. I now get a generic email from an escalation person at Jeep Corporate and they are very vague and stated we will get another update on parts in October. Very unsatisfied with my first Jeep purchase and would not recommend to others. I can’t drive the vehicle or even sell it as it does not run.",0
"I bought a 2016 Jeep Patriot a year ago this month. Since the day we drove it off of the lot the XM Satellite Radio has not worked properly. It loses the signal every 1/2 mile or so and fades in and out constantly while driving, and it doesn't matter if we're in town or out in the middle of nowhere. I have complained and had it in the shop repeatedly for this problem and all I ever get is lied to and called a liar because they can't duplicate the problem, even though I've shown them no less than four videos of the radio losing its signal. My wife finally took the service manager at our dealership on a ride-along and proved to him that the radio is a piece of junk, to which he agreed. Corporate still WILL NOT REPLACE THE RADIO with one that actually WORKS.
      Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram SUCKS! I have own three brand new Hyundais, all with XM, and NOT ONE SINGLE PROBLEM, EVER! We have a so-called Case Manager from Uconnect who is about as worthless as ** on a boar hog. He whines that he's not authorized to have the radio replaced. Then why has he been wasting my time, dragging me down to the dealership time and again only to be told Im a liar and they cant help me. I may have an arbitration agreement that I was forced to sign, but it only precludes class-action suits. Im getting my own lawyer and I am going to sue Jeep under Nevadas Lemon Law. And its going to cost them a whole lot more than a radio by the time its over. Also, I will NEVER buy another Jeep, or anything else this fly-by-night outfit makes. Screw buying American, I'm going back to the Koreans for my next ride.",0
"The vehicle (2014 Jeep Latitude) is not worth the money. I drove it off the lot and immediately had issues with the transmission shifting hard. Took it back. They said it was because it was new. 16,000 miles later had to put a new transmission in. Today took it in because it's still shifting hard and was told ""All the motor mounts are bad and need replacing. We are still working on trying to do the updates to the computer for the transmission. We will let you know."" Never again will I buy a Jeep!! Nothing but issues with the transmission and other stuff. Oh yea I have taken it in many times on the AC not working. You will be driving and all of a sudden it will start heating. They still haven't fixed that issue. Nothing but junk and oh yea the power train doesn't cover the motor mounts. That's 1300.00 that I have to pay outta pocket. This should be on their dime for all the trouble I have had with this piece of crap!!! Don't buy one. You will regret it in the long run!!",0
"2017 Jeep (4 Cyl) - Rented one from Enterprise while on vacation and drove it about 200 mi over three days in San Fran and Napa. Flat out not bad but has so little power on hills (drive back roads of Napa/Sonoma that it had less power than the K cars of the 80's which had 110 HP engines). I mean on steep hills, floored you couldn't get more than 25 MPH. Door locks did not work so had to press them down by hand and car had overall cheap feel to it. Would never buy one and if this is what AMC is turning out, it's back to the 50's for that car company. Oh, the noise inside is about the same as take off in a 727!",0
"I have never had as many issues with a brand new car as I have with used cars. All my previous cars I bought used can put well over 150,000 miles on them and never had any issues except regular maintenance. I decided to buy a brand new jeep and have only owned it 2 years. Nothing but issues, and no help when I take it in to get it fixed. I keep trying to tell them my transmission is slipping, but they keep telling me it’s just the computer. Definitely not... Jeep sucks as a manufacture and business. Horrible customer service.",0
"I bought my first 2014 Jeep Overland and within 3 years my Jeep would just die while driving. Took the vehicle in and they could never figure out what was wrong. I drove it for a couple more months and the same thing would happen that I eventually was so scared to drive my vehicle, more so with my grandkids in the car that I decided to trade it in for another Jeep. I really like the look and feel of the Jeep that I just thought I had a lemon and would buy a new one. 
      So I buy a brand new 2017 Jeep Summit. Has 2000 miles on it and now this one starts to shift gears when it is coasting or coming to a complete stop. I now have been told I need a new transmission in my Jeep. Just so frustrating and really sad that I now have gone through 2 brand new vehicles with Jeep! My dealer has been very reasonable with helping me. I know it is not their fault but what is happening to the Jeep. Wish I would have learned the first time!!",0
"I bought a 2017 Jeep Rubicon 2 months ago. It has 3000 miles on it. We were driving along a driveway @ 15mph 2 days ago and the back window of the Jeep EXPLODED shattering into hundreds of pieces (as it's designed to do). We checked around the vehicle and could find nothing that would have caused it to shatter. We are traveling in CO, so took it to the nearest Jeep dealer who, indicated to my husband that they could not even LOOK @ it for another MONTH. They then referred us to the local auto glass company for repair. 
      When we asked about warranty, the dealer said it would be our insurance - not warranty. When I outreached to Jeep/Wave, they indicated that, without a jeep dealer's ""diagnosis"" they could not provide warranty coverage so we would have to use our insurance to repair it. They also indicated that they could not ""force"" their DEALER to perform the diagnosis in a more timely fashion. All this leaving us to pay out of pocket for the replacement OR drive around CO for the next month waiting for the dealer to find the time to diagnose our window. Shoddy warranty coverage Jeep. Shame on you!",0
"I have always been a Jeep fan, from the time of childhood. I loved everything about them, the look, the engine, the fact that they were American made, and the impression that they took care of their customers. Sadly something as little as an auxiliary cord insert has changed all that. After my auxiliary cord started to malfunction I took the car into the jeep dealership to get it looked at. They sprung their diagnosis fee at me last minute which so happened to be $100 dollars, to look at the radio. They came back to tell me conveniently that this issue couldn't be fixed and that I would need an entire new radio which would be extra, of course. Knowing exactly what happened to the auxiliary cord, I questioned their diagnosis.
      So I contacted the company directly, which apparently means to them that I didn't understand what was being told to me at the dealership, so they clarified all the information, (basically a waste of time with ID member **), who also failed to answer my other question of who is supervisor was and how to contact them. What makes matters worse is that I was informed in the waiting room by a fellow customer, how to fix the problem for only $50. I had already agreed to the diagnosis fee, assuming the Jeep Company had their customer's interests at heart. Instead I felt like it was another situation of a big company taking advantage of the little guys, for a small price.After seeing their reviews, it doesn't surprise me that their customer service rate is so low. It seems as though Jeep is trying to fix that the wrong way. All of the employees were very nice telling me they were unable to fix the problem, but that's not what customer service is about. It's not about being nice. It's about having your customers best interest at heart and that is NOT a Jeep thing.Further information, I have had the car 2 years and as great as it has treated me, it's not a car I would recommend. I got into a minor fender bender a couple of months back where I hit another car going 10 mph. There was no visible damage to either cars, so we just exchanged information and went our separate ways. The Next day my check engine light went on and my car started to act funky, so I took it into Midas. They told me that it looked like my car hit a metal pole, with all the damage that was created, $900 of internal damages after a hit going 15 mph.Another issue I've had with the car was its roaders. My aunt drove my car over a parking curb. That one bump created an additional $800 bill because the roaders are not make to support that type of maneuver. (Rolling OVER a CURB.) Jeeps get a fake rap for being tough. That is not the case with the patriot. I am done with Jeeps based on their priorities alone. Take care of your mechanics (who get paid by the customer btw, not the company). Take care of your customers, and maybe your cars.",0
"So I've been reading that this is a problem with the 2014 Jeep Cherokee and even the dealer admits it and can do nothing for me. I've had the Jeep go bone dry and shut down after 5k miles on multiple occasions prior to realizing this was an ongoing issue. This time I had the oil changed 3200 miles ago and the engine seized this morning. If this happened on the highway I could see it resulting in injury or death. The manufacturer does nothing, the dealer (Lester Glenn Jeep, Toms River, NJ) does nothing. I'm told for them to do anything it has to meet lower than whatever the standard were for a vehicle to burn which was something like a quart per 1k miles. I've had 10-20 yr old vehicles that didn't burn oil like that. This isn't normal. This time around it did burn quicker than the allotted quart/mi and I imagine it's not going to be improving. Don't buy this year Jeep and I think 2015 has the same problems.",0
"2017 Jeep Renegade - Received a tiny chip in windshield, parked car in garage. Was going to take to repair shop for seal injection and found a 6 inch crack extending from small chip.

"My experience with buying and owning a Jeep Patriot. I bought a Jeep Patriot Sport with a manual transmission in 2011. Bought it new (zero miles). I now have only 33000 miles on the vehicle. It has never been off-road and has never pulled or towed anything. Recently, I noticed a noise coming from the powertrain. Took it to a mechanic who advised me that I probably needed a clutch replacement (clutch, throw-out bearing and pressure plate). I contacted Chrysler/Jeep about the situation and asked if they would cover the repairs on the powertrain. Their response was as in this e-mail response: 
      ""Thank you for contacting the Jeep Customer Assistance Center. It is understandable that you would like to know if you have warranty coverage prior to getting your vehicle repaired at an independent repair facility. As per your warranty booklet, manual transmission clutch parts are not covered at any time and the pressure plate throw out bearing was only covered for 1 year and 12000 miles so there would be no factory warranty coverage for these repairs. I also want to let you know that the Powertrain warranty expired on September 30, 2016. While looking into this matter for you, I also see that you have 1 incomplete recall. The S61- OCCUPANT RESTRAINT CONTROLLER recall does not yet have parts available but the parts are expected to become available in June. Once the parts become available you can get that repair completed by scheduling an appointment at your local dealership. ""I would like to add you to the special tracking so that you receive an email when those parts become available. You also have an extended warranty for your (X69) FRONT/REAR CROSSMEMBERS. You are able to have a free annual inspection for the Cross Members and if they are deemed to be corroded any time prior to September 30, 2021, they will be replaced free of charge as well. Thank you again for your email. Should you require additional assistance, or have any new information to provide, please reply to this email message or call 1-877-I-AM-JEEP (1-877-426-5337).""In 2011, when I purchased this vehicle (new) I had every expectation that it would last a long time. I have kept up on the maintenance and, as evidenced by the low mileage, I have driven it reasonably. I certainly did not expect that there would be two safety recalls, (one of which they cannot correct because they don't have the parts to resolve the issue). I certainly did not expect that there would be a potentially serious issue with corrosion of FRONT/REAR CROSSMEMBERS, to the extent that Jeep extended the warranty on these parts only. And I certainly did not expect that the powertrain would go out on me so soon, at only 33000 miles.In retrospect, upon examining the warranty information more closely, it seems that there must be a reason Chrysler/Jeep offers such an inadequate warranty on their product. Could it be that they know they are selling an inferior product that would probably fail in a relatively short time? One can only guess. I must conclude, from my experience, that Chrysler/Jeep has produced and sold an inferior product (as described above) and that further, they appear to be unwilling to back up their product with an adequate warranty plan. It is my intention to NEVER purchase another of their products. Furthermore, I cannot, in good conscience (based upon this experience) recommend that anyone else purchase any of their products. Since it is evident that Chrysler/Jeep is not going to do anything to resolve the situation, I guess that I am left without recourse. Lesson learned. Don't buy a Jeep. Caveat emptor.",0
"I bought a Renegade 2015 and allegedly sold me a warranty against MECHANICAL MISTAKES; I signed a paper that says ""INSURANCE OF MECHANICAL FAILURES""; It turned out to be a guayazos insurance and wash the seats if they are stained. The collection of the policy was $895.00 and the insurance has an invoice of $240.00 which I have a copy (MAPFRE IS THE INSURER AND THE INSURANCE IS CALLED AUTOGUARD). I can say that the Renegade Jeep is a crap is only aesthetic and the warranty is very short combined with the dealer who cheated me, not even gave me carpets or accessories any further, they promised change of oil for 2 years or 8 changes of oil but As the Renegade uses synthetic oil they only honored me only 4. I have already invested around $1000.00 and right now I am without a car until possibly on Monday the vehicle be repair.",0
"A great deal of vibration at stoplights. When it is in gear and you break for a full stop... stay there, OMG it is bad. So bad my feet go numb after a 1/2 hour of driving The Jeep. When using the defrost or AC it makes the Jeep shake more. Jeep told my serviceman they know it is rubber in the motor mounts causing it. But not willing to fix it. They wont fix it. Jeep says there is nothing wrong with it. I have had it to the dealership twice now.",0
My brand new Jeep Renegade has a loud whistle noise coming from window... it is louder than the radio. I asked dealership in Brooksville FL 3 times to fix it.

Don't ever buy a Jeep.,0
"I bought my 2016 Jeep Renegade new. I have had it since March of 2016. I am VERY dissatisfied with it and the Jeep experience. I started having problems with it around July of last year and it has literally been in and out of the shop since. I lose gas power while driving, it just does not go. Jeep's reasoning behind no gas is ""the transmission is trying to find a gear."" This is NOT acceptable. A car should go no matter what when you push the gas pedal down. 
      I have had a few close calls because my car chooses when it wants to go. I have also been told ""turn your traction control off and this should fix the problem."" I am not sure why this should fix my problem, my car should go when I push the gas down. I asked why I have to manually put my car in first gear, their response is ""First gear is for four wheel drive."" Well, there is your problem. That's why it ""can't find a gear"" when I am rolling forward, or turning and trying to go. Maybe it needs first gear. This is the WORST car I have EVER driven. I love how the excuses of why it drives so horribly just flow like a river. I should feel safe when I drive my car, and I don't because I don't know when it is going to happen. The problem has happened to my husband and my son.",0
"Lemon Law help with 2016 Jeep Latitude 3.0 FWD: I bought a new Jeep from Nyle Maxwell Chrysler Dodge in Austin, Texas. From the get go, they allowed each bank to pull a hard pull credit instead of pulling one and telling banks it was a soft pull. This tanked my credit, but I digress. From the start, the wipers failed during a storm. They came loose and grabbed the other wiper and I couldn't see past 100 yards on a one lane toll! Only by the grace of God did I not crash. I found the closest Dealership and called, but service didn't care that I was traveling through Houston. They told me to leave it overnight.
      I tried Rivercity location and the service manager saved the day when another service guy laughed at me when I told him I nearly could have crashed. Betty, the Service manager told me to come right in. The rain was less violent by then. Because it was a new version of Jeep, they had no parts and took the wipers off a new vehicle. A month or so later, there was a recall on wipers, which my Dealer handled when I took my Jeep in for a cruise control problem. The cruise control would not maintain a 2-3 mile range after going down even a low grade hill. It would go up to 12 miles more, and then attempt to slow, but it wasn't a smooth transition. It was Jerky, but not dramatic, but unacceptable.They updated the computer, installed new wipers and told me that maybe the cruise control would fix by update... but it did not. I would add that I was given a rental car, but find it unacceptable that you make an appointment, and they can't look at it for 4-5 days! There seems to always be recall backlogs! The second time I took it in, I allowed a guy in service to ""test drive"" it home and back. My advisor drove it, too, but because no ""codes"" came out on computer, they couldn't do anything. Both also said that the cruise worked fine... so, I go pick it up and bam! It still does the same thing going on a hilly area in San Antonio, but not huge hills, just low to medium grade hills.As a side note, I use my car to earn money, and each time they ""test"" it and give me a rental, I am without any way of making bank! My first oil change was a normal one, averaging 21 mph, but since then, I use full synthetic and it went to 24 mph. I came to work in Austin, and the auto stop and on feature stopped working. This affected the RPM, which now never goes down to zero anymore. I've burned through a tank of gas after only 150 miles, getting 19 mph! Of course this was on a Friday afternoon, too. So, I can't earn what I need, defeating the purpose of coming to Austin, and next week SXSW travelers begin to arrive. I CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS IT, YET CANNOT AFFORD TO DRIVE THIS LEMON!The other issue is when the auto stop feature was off and I would go down a steep hill, the brakes would come on and slow me down! This sounds like a transmission problem, too! Is Chrysler waiting for the warranty to expire? I've got nearly 25,000 miles now and need help to get rid of this lemon. There is a lemon law, right? Angry and broke!",0

"Check Engine Light/Software Updates - To begin with I am glad that you are reading this, on the other hand I am sad. Simply because you would not reading this unless you have had problems with your vehicle. I bought a new 2015 Jeep Renegade Trailblazer, bad mistake. This is the fifth Jeep I have owned and let me quite frank about it, it is a piece of garbage. If I had known the thing had been made in Italy I would not have bought it, much less traded my 2010 Jeep Liberty for it. At this date it has less than 20,000 miles on it and I have the records to show that it has had over 20 software updates done to it. Lemon law, right, the only thing that is yellow here is the Jeep representative that will not return my calls, and at this point the service manager at the dealership will not return my calls either. They know the vehicle is a piece of (well you know what).
      Right, I am pissed, but who cares out there? I am writing this just to blow some steam off. Vacation time comes around and I'm afraid to go anywhere far in it. That's sad, new vehicle and no trip anywhere. Now, let me say this. I have found out the motor of this thing was designed by the same man who designed Maserati's, (or so I have been told), well he might know fast motors, but he dang sure is not an electronics guy. Really, JEEP should take pride in the fact that they used to be made in America and that they have served in many wars and stand up for the American people that bought their products. By doing so, Mr. JEEP guys, just take this piece of heap that you call a vehicle and stick it. Just pay off the remainder of my note. And in return, I promise you, I that I will never make my driveway look that bad again, by having a Jeep parked in it. If anybody out there, has any suggestions, feel free to comment about it.",0
"I just bought a 2006 Jeep Commander, love it except for during the recent rain water leaked through my Sunroof and flooded my car with about 1 inch of water on the passenger side. After doing research online I guess this is a normal occurrence with the Jeep sunroof. I think this is ridiculous that due to a design flaw I now have to find someone to clear the blue tube within the sunroof and pay someone to get the water out of my car that I'm sure has now damaged the carpet and foam underneath. I've called Cerritos Jeep, I did not purchase car there, however it is a dealer and no help. How is this my fault??",0

"No wonder used Jeeps are being sold just under the warranty expiration for such a cheap price! GOOGLE any used Jeep and you'll think you're getting a deal. Bought this vehicle from Duluth Dodge Chrysler, it was a 2014 used with 29,000 on it. It seemed to start to have odometer issues and so the odometer was replaced under warranty. It would reset miles traveled so I couldn't get exact mileage on it. I hadn't problems with it until it hit 87,000 miles, and suddenly an obscure diagnosis from the dealership, considering, Jeep and most Chrysler products have had this problem for years. First the ETC (throttle control light flashed) while traveling 30 mph uphill and then car sputtered and almost stalled out. Situation didn't happen again for another week, just after having new brakes, and rotors on the rear. The brakes didn't wear evenly either, but not much of a concern over that at the moment, considering the car is now undrivable.
      While leaving a parking garage, the attendant left the vehicle run, and when I got inside, the ETC, the Engine Light, and ESC lights stayed on. Car, stalled, I followed directions by shutting car off according to the owner's manual (which is a dead giveaway Chrysler has seen this issue before) -- however, I had to inch my way home with several stops, stalls, and at one point the car jumped while I had my foot on the brake at a stoplight nearly hitting a pedestrian, because it idled so high, the entire instrument panel lit up like a Xmas tree. It just went to the dealership which I could only afford a one hour scan $220 bucks to have them say it must be an electrical issue and they had all kinds of codes come up.I mentioned to them that this issue is fairly common with Jeeps but again, they are covering their ears and perhaps it's a problem they cannot fix because they have no idea how to repair it. They called and said, they'd like to see if they can save me money and perform some type of pigging back wire connection to the throttle. They said it was the throttle that wasn't getting enough juice, but there must be a short somewhere, but it could get expensive trying to find it, so here was their short-cut alternative.I've read other posts here about the wires shorting out because they're too close to the camshaft or catalytic converter... I wouldn't know -- but I do know that Chrysler has been STALLING ON A RECALL for this problem for years. Had this happened on the highway and if it happens on the highway, somebody could get killed, and I'm sure there's been a few that have. Chrysler needs to have a class action lawsuit brought against them. This is a life and death situation that doesn't have to happen.",0
"Purchased 2014 (new) Jeep Patriot from Nielsen Jeep/Dodge in East Hanover NJ Route 10. Computer on vehicle failed twice costing us hundreds in rental car fees as well as the inconvenience. The dealer does not cover the rental car and each time we drop the car off we have to wait almost a week before they will even look at it. We are also forced to pay an initial fee to determine that it is in fact a warranty issue. The computer is covered, but not the initial evaluation fee or the rental cars. I would think Nielsen/Chrysler would stand behind their product. We now have a car that is unreliable and we don't know where to turn. Is the computer going to fail again and strand us on a dark road in the middle of nowhere?",0
The worst vehicle that I have ever own. No... the worst investment that I have ever made. This vehicle has given me nothing but issues. I think that I may stop parking it in the garage and just park it at the mechanic every night. At 30000 the thermostat failed; at 50000 miles the water pump failed; soon after the head gasket blew; then the head itself; then the water pump again; the heat; the alarm would go off when driving; had two batteries die due to a draw somewhere; the camshaft had to be replaced; the cam sensor; oh... let's not forget the oil sender sensor and now back in the shop because it randomly stalls at speeds over 40 miles an hour. I feel like I am driving a Yugo.,0
"I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty w/ 3.7L/V6 engine. The main issues is the RADIATOR made of combined plastic and aluminum components. I had my faulty radiator replaced 5 times since I bought it due to horrible leaking! This design flaw of PLASTIC components, COMBINED with the leaking the radiator ALWAYS RESULTS to ENGINE DAMAGE DUE TO 1) valve gasket busted, 2) coolant mixing into the ignition chamber or within the cylinders, 3) Valve seat problems... ALL causing CYLINDER MISFIRES. The downside... is VERY, VERY expensive as in the thousands of dollars! Radiator's hose are also troublesome. There are many issues with Jeep's product and 3.7L engine design, that many in the World wide web consider it a JUNK (SCIENCE). Wondering, they have discontinued the LIBERTY design?
      What I have observed is the MIXED plastic components also found in its interiors, electronic issues, fan clutch issues, power steering noise issue including rack & pinions, hoses and belts and become easily TOO ""rotten"", I have been upkeep with maintenance: Synthetic engine oil, transmission fluid exchange, Coolant exchange, Rear diff exchange, Air filters, BELTs and tensioner, etc. BUT still it boils down to the Radiator plus minus ENGINE cooling components. FEEL the HEAAATTTTT! LESSON I've learned. STAY AWAY from a JEEP PRODUCT!",0
"I had rented a Jeep compass 12/09/16 and that day I had a roll over accident. I drive professionally and that day I drove at a safe speed for the road conditions. Speed at about fifteen to twenty mph before applying the brake. It had snowed and there was ice conditions. I attempted to stop at a stop sign on a paved road base when the car began to shut down (clicking noises) but the car seemed to pick up momentum. As the car ran through the stop area. The road changed from paved base to a dirt road base. I continued to apply the brake. 
      As the car came upon the dirt road I was hoping the dirt road would provide grab but the momentum continued. The car slid from about twenty feet when applying the brake before the stop sign plus across about a twenty-foot dirt road base slipping for a total of about forty feet. As I viewed the ditch (luckily no water in it) I was headed for, with a ten foot drop, I thought I did all that I could and prepared for the hurt that I and the car will have. And now, two days later, I use the term ""terminator"". I felt the car had its on will. Applying the brake did nothing. I hope this vehicle is recalled because I could of easily not have been viable now.",0
The transmission on my 2015 has been recalled. It takes attention to shifting and does not have a positive feel for which gear it goes into. I have driven a new Jeep every 2 yrs. and have been happy in the past. I hate the new electronic controlled 9 gear shift mechanism. Before Fiat got involved the Jeeps were great.,1
"Simply - I love my jeep. Bought this 06 in 2011, but have never been happier w/ a vehicle before. I've owned a few, even classics. But my jeep can go anywhere, has the power, turning capabilities, comfort and design as well as the stereo system is awesome. My dogs even love it!!! I love my Commander!!",1
"Great vehicle, has had very few maintenance issues. I have owned three Jeeps and have had terrific experiences with each. The cars have been reliable, durable and gotten me through plenty of varied weather and terrain with no issues. I would definitely recommend Jeeps to anyone looking for a reasonably priced trustworthy SUV.",1
"It's clumsy, ugly, has far too many problems and was apparently built with cheap parts. This vehicle was clearly manufactured to give regular problems so that the owner would spend as much as possible on parts.",0
"We bought a jeep from Airpark Jeep in Scottsdale, AZ on October 1st 2016. Airpark finance department told us in writing that Chase Bank was our lender. We received the payment book and promptly made our first payment and set up auto payment to Chase Bank the first week of November. On November 21st, we started receiving phone calls from Ally Financial stating we missed our payment!
      We never received notification from Airpark that Ally held the note on our Jeep and not Chase Bank. We never received any loan payment information indicating we had a loan with Ally Financial. We did receive loan payment information from Chase bank so we promptly paid the loan. Airpark discovered there are/were two loan contracts created for our vehicle, BUT they neglected to notify us that they submitted our contract to a new lender.We continue to get daily phone calls from Ally after we escalated the calls to Ally's management team where they assured us the calls would stop, and they would be working with Airpark dealership's financial department to get this straightened out ASAP. The Dealership financial management became involved after we couldn't get responses or returned calls from our finance contact person. Airpark has assured us this is being taken care of but we continue to receive harassing phone calls from Ally Financial every day!
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        We now have to wait and field the calls and pray that this mess is cleaned up BEFORE it is submitted to the credit agencies which will destroy our credit!!!!SERIOUSLY?!? We are being harassed DAILY for something we can't control and Airpark Finance department now states it is out of their control. How did they let this happen and NOT notify their client to any changes???",0
"This vehicle has to be the worst investment that I have ever made. I have had nothing but problems with the Jeep Liberty since I bought it. Within two months of purchase, the water pump blew. Since then, I've had to replace the pump again, the thermostat and head gasket. It is back in the shop after being towed AGAIN.",0
"Handles well and is solid. I have a liberty limited, get great mileage for the size engine. The company just needs to do a better job for fixing the back passenger window and the driver's seat belt that don't always stay clipped.",1
Jeep built to last. Jeep liberty is great on gas mileage being a diesel. It's great with pulling trailers and hauling. Great performance. Been in our family for years. We love it. Does what its name stands for... JEEP.,1
Would not stand behind warranty. The driver's side mirror broke when it would not fold as designed. Dealership would not replace. Cost me $487. Called FCA line and all they do is back the dealer so what's the point? Also Jay the caseworker was unprofessional and hung up on me.,0
"Larry H Miller dealership has resolved the issue to my satisfaction. They stepped up and repaired the broken trans dipstick tube with no charge to me. However, Chrysler Llc would not assist with the repair.
  Original Review: Nov. 9, 2016I have a 2011 Jeep Patriot with just under 35k miles. I took my jeep in for an oil change and the transmission dipstick tube is rusted thru and broke off. I haven't even had to change the trans fluid yet. I called Chrysler llc who said they would work with me but I had to go to a dealership. I went to Larry H Miller dealership who said they would cover the costs of repair but I had to pay $140 for the diagnosis. The part itself is only $40... They are scamming me. I will find a mechanic who is not affiliated with Chrysler. My relationship with Chrysler is over!",1
"I am writing because I purchased a pre owned certified car and 2 days later a/c had terrible musty chemical smell every time it was turned on. Brought back to dealership 48 hours after purchased, they lied and never told us they had policy where they take car back if within 5 days, instead they jerked our around for over a month and the car was in service 3 times and yet no service, invoices documented. Contacted GM since day of purchase and still no word from him. I have also left numerous messages for serv. mgr. Mike who stated ""We want you happy. Call me anytime"" and once again, no callback. NOW, FILED COMPLAINTS WITH JEEP CORP., DCH CORP. because this could be detrimental to my health and wife's or any other passenger.",0
"I have a 2014 Jeep Patriot that has a massive oil leak from the engine valve cover. This is covered in the warranty as part of the powertrain unlimited mile warranty. When I called to make an appointment they told me I had to wait a week for a diagnostic appointment that will cost me $105 and take 24-48 hours. They will not offer me a loaner or rental even though it is a manufacturer malfunction. Then, if they determine that it is covered under warranty their engine technician is backed up for 3-4 weeks. Meanwhile I'm scared that my engine will catch on fire because I can smell the oil burning while I drive!!! I've decide to take it to the mechanic and pay for the repair myself. This is ridiculous. I will never buy a Jeep vehicle again.",0
"Bought it new from Lester Glenn, Toms River NJ, paid 42k. Was originally offered a year of free oil changes in writing, they never honored them - too much hassle so I just do it myself. Constantly receiving recall notices since 8 months after purchase and to this day (10/2016), Schedule with Cherry Hill Triplex to perform said recalls on several occasions - take off from work and then they tell me they don't have the parts and to keep calling them like it's my responsibility?? This has happened twice so far.
      Third time they actually repaired the visor recalled due to possible fire damage. Tried to get leather dash fixed, scheduled a time, took a day off, got there and they said warranty guy was off today, eventually got there when he was in and he look at the dash issues bubbling - signs of peeling with around 20k miles on it, they said it wasn't covered and never even documented the visit. So now I have only 27k miles but exceeded the three year limit so Jeep Corporate says they would have covered it under warranty but not now, they offered a ""friendly"", ""We'll pay the labor. You pay towards the dash @ $800 or something."" I spent like 12k extra for all the fancy leather & gadgets and it won't even last 4 years.",0
We were stopped at a red light when my 1999 Jeep took off by itself. Even with both feet trying to hold the breaks we still ended up going thru the intersection. Very scary. Then about 20 minutes later on interstate the Jeep slowed itself down to 30 mph when we were originally traveling at 75 mph.,0
"I bought my Jeep Liberty Jet in 2014 at 21000 miles, is now 33000 mi. In August I was at the Jersey Shore driving on hwy going 55 mi, car dashboard light up then turned off, lost power. I had no control of acceleration pedal - dropped down to 25 mph, was lucky no cars was behind me. I pulled over to shoulder of road. I turned off car engine then turned back on, it was fine then happened two more times.
      Another time night interior light came on, didn't go off when I turned off car, did it manually, keyless entry does not work to start car on both keys. I changed battery - first time happened. 2 months after bought car then last month other one don't work. On dashboard gate ajar light does not go off even though flipper glass and lift gate works fine, however I do see when it rains the inside if flipper glass edge inside is wet.When I turn on headlights when dusk outside my dashboard fades out. Bought it to Jeep dealer in Paramus. They said I need to repair TIPM wire and need rear tailgate actuator repair. They said it will cost $1050. Some of these things happened after the recall of the faulty airbags were installed. Also had a misfire #5 code, had it fixed 2 months ago. This car has more issues than Vogue. Hope Chrysler recognizes there are a couple of people on car complaints.com and other website blogs having same problem.Car drives ok but I don't feel safe driving it on hwy. This is my second jeep. I love the car. I buy American Trust in the work but who knows where the parts are being made. Spoke to dealer, lemon law, Jeep complaints, blogged, want to let others know they can be in danger, none of their agencies can do anything about this issue. I have no choice but to pay out of pocket for something that looks like it is a recall/defect especially with the TIPM. Going to get it fixed before I get killed by this jeep.",0
"Let me start from the beginning. I bought a brand new 2015 Jeep Renegade. First week the brakes and rotors had to be changed then week 2 I took in for capless gas tank not letting me fit the nozzle in and an extremely rough idle. They did a software update on it and said nothing was wrong with the gas tank. Next, I take in again because motor is extremely rough and still not able to put the nozzle in without having to fight with the nozzle and force it in. Salesmen and managers all experience this and the extremely rough idle. They tell me the parts are on back order so I take to another dealership who does 5 more motor updates and I call customer care about the parts being on back order and them not being able to fix the rough idle either. She tells me they would overnight the parts. This actually takes a week.
      I ask for a rental car and they tell me that there none available because of the long weekend which is a lie so I ask Sarah the customer care lady in charge of my case if I can rent my own and be reimbursed, she tells me yes. I go pick up my car a week later and still vibrates off and on like a week later. At this point I have had it in 4 times for the same issue. The customer care lady would do nothing! She tells me I have to keep taking it in as long as it takes! I was so frustrated by her customer service and the lady at the car service center that I just traded it in and lost 4000.00 on trade in! Their customer case managers are the worse people to have to deal with! And to top it off, they said they wouldn't pay for the rental car because I got rid of the piece of junk and they closed the case!",0
"I am absolutely astounded that Jeep/Dodge/Chrysler is selling automobiles. I purchased a brand new car in 2015 and it has broken down 9 times, I am going nuts. Dealership does nothing... no integrity... Zeigler Dodge of Schaumburg is a travesty. Chrysler ignores complaints while I ride my bike.",0
"I bought my 2011 Jeep Liberty from CarMax in White Marsh MD. The night I took the vehicle above 50 mph the roof had a very noisy air leak. I have had the gasket replaced within the first 30 days and there was no noise until two weeks later when it came back even louder. I complained to CarMax who then told me it was a manufacturer's design flaw and everyone (except me and my salesman) are aware of the sky roof's problematic history. I was told by CarMax to take it to a Jeep dealership to have them fix it because they could do no more for me. Really? I have read horror stories online since and some are paying $5,000 to repair/replace the sky roof and it still leaks. Please let me know what options are available to me. Thank you.",0
"I wanted to write and ask if anyone else has had a problem with their Jeep Liberty suddenly catching fire. I had this happen to me for no apparent reason. No warning lights, no strange sounds, nothing. I was driving along and LUCKILY a driver behind me honked his horn and flashed his lights to get my attention. I came to a stop at a stoplight and that's when smoke and flames started to come out of the vents and fill the interior of the Jeep. I pulled off the road into a convenience store parking lot, jumped out and ran inside. The fire department arrived in less than 5 minutes but my Jeep was a complete loss. I have attached the pictures to show the aftermath. THANK GOD that I escaped but sadly I was left with a pile of ash that my insurance company would only pay a ""depreciated value"" for the remains...",0
My 2016 Jeep Patriot is 3 months old today. Had 11km on it when we left the lot. 2 weeks ago today we were driving on the highway and touched a button on the nav screen and the screen cracked like a spider web. Jeep is saying its not covered under warranty so I'd like to know why I pay for warranty? I'm beyond pissed and I'll never buy another jeep again. Wondering if anyone else has ever had this happen? One lady at the dealership thinks the high temps might have caused it as it was 40C at the time.,0
"2015 Jeep Patriot Sport 11,600 Miles - I purchased a Jeep Patriot brand new in 7/2015. Today I take it for a oil change and the transmission is leaking where it connects to the engine. I was told the tranny has to be replaced but they cannot tell me ""when"" it will be fixed. Chrysler and the dealership refuse to provide a loaner. All their customer service people say is ""I understand your frustration"" and then say I just have to wait. I was supposed to go on a family prepaid, non-refundable vacation tomorrow. GREAT customer service Jeep. I'm sure glad I bought such a reliable, brand new vehicle that you back so well!! What a joke!!!",0
"2010 Jeep Liberty 3.7 liter engine with 74400 miles on it - I bought my Jeep last July 2015. I have had it in the multiple times for the water pump, heater core, thermostat, misfire several times and now brought it in on Wednesday August 3, 2016. It was loosing fluid out of the overflow so we called and brought it in to the shop and now they tell me that my engine is toast because we blew a head gasket. Nice right. 
      I still owe money on the Jeep and my husband is disabled and we only have 1 vehicle. How am I going to bring him back and forth to the doctors and I have to work to make money and we don't have a pot to piss in. And I just spoke to Jeep helpline and they said they lend me a helping hand because after 7 minutes on the phone that we don't fit any of the criteria to get help. WTF. So much for Jeeps. I will not ever buy one again. You suck!!! My last Jeep is 16 years old and has 168000 miles on it when I sold it and it still running and never had a problem with it!!! Thanks JEEP.",0
"On May 19 I was told I need a transfer case which would be covered under warranty. It is now August 2 and I am being told it will still take another week. I can barely drive the car. I've been told repeatedly that it would be in on a certain date, only to have the date slip week by week. I now understand why they refused to give me a tracking # the last time I called. Each time they pass me to a different case manager. I am convinced that Chrysler just doesn't want to do warranty service.",0
"While I was driving my 2014 Jeep Patriot with 32,900 miles on it and this is what happened 7-20-16 (see pics). I purchased this vehicle 4-28-16. Dealer says 4-5 days before it will be serviced. This is a serious problem!",0
"My car has broken eight days ago, and it was towed to the nearest dealership at that time (Nielsen East Hanover). So far, even after several contacts with the dealership and with this customer service, I have no information what is wrong with the car and why I was not provided with a loaner. This is a leasing car, I am paying for it, and my next bill will come with the same amount, even after these days that I am not using it. 
      I have now to commute my daily 60 miles walking 25 minutes to the train station to catch a train. I have to ask my neighbor to take my child to the day care. I have a hip replacement and have to walk distances that I should not have to... because I LEASE A JEEP!!! I am paying for this leasing!!! The dealership tells me to ask a loaner to the Customer Service. The Customer Service tells me that it is waiting for the dealership to decide on whether they will give me a loaner or not. And yet, no information about when the car will be fixed. Is this the way JEEP treats its customers? I've never felt so frustrated and disappointed before, to the point that I decided to get a lawyer to help getting my rights.",0
"I was on my first trip to enjoy the fall color on my jeep which at that point had 20k miles on it and found a good spot of highway and felt like using the cruise for the first at a 65 mph speed limit road. When I set it at 65 mph, it was driving smoothly then suddenly it accelerated with a sudden boost of power and picked up speed. I was amazed and intimidated, had to immediately get the car off cruise as it went as high as 70 mph. I have called the dealer and asked him a lot of time after being put on hold for minutes to be told that it was just a one time occurrence and will not happen. I am not satisfied with the explanation that I got and have decided never to use the cruise control again and would advice the same to all traveling with family.",0
"So Chrysler Jeep back in 2007, to sell more vehicles, started offering an unlimited power train warranty, for the life of your vehicle while you owned it,
      which sounds great. IF THEY TOLD YOU THAT YOU NEEDED TO HAVE AN INSPECTION OR IT WOULD BE VOIDED. Come to find out that apparently itis stated in the documents, you put away after purchase and never at till you need service. ""Oh we notified you."" So they claim that it was to expire. Check your warranty papers. This is bad business. Chrysler has found a way to back out of its commitment again. My vehicle was in for service in Dec 2013, my five years would of been 3 months later. Someone at dealer should of mention. Now that I need the warranty it has been VOID. Thank you.",0
"My hitch was inspected by a jeep dealer in peebles, ohio... it was very rusty. Later in day, I tried to hitch a small boat to the hitch, and it folded to the ground. When I told the inspecting dealer, he said the only criteria was measured how far from gas tank, hitch protects it, no strength. Called Jeep, no help.",0
"I have a 2015 Jeep SRT bought in the dealer Flagship in Bayamon, Puerto Rico in April 2015. The Brembo calipers clear coat started to peel off around 9,500 miles and one year from purchase. I went to the dealer and after waiting several weeks for a response with no success, I had to contact them and they informed me this is an aesthetic issue that warranty would not cover! I tried to appeal that response but have never been able to get above the dealer level. I have tried every means possible, avoiding to go to the Puerto Rico Consumer Affairs Department, but the experience with Jeep-Chrysler's customer service has been the worst I have had in my life.
      Upon research in the web I found that this is a very common problem to SRT owners and the feeling is the same; Jeep-Chrysler does not want to be responsible about this manufacturing issue and they avoid covering it under warranty. This is an SUV which base price is $65,000 and here in Puerto Rico, taxes included, is almost $80,000! It is incredible that a vehicle of such a high price has such a poor quality material and manufacturing in a part that is one of its main visual attributes. Anyone knows that this part is exposed to high temperatures and Jeep-Chrysler engineers should know better. I wish there is something that Consumer Affairs can do to help us Jeep SRT owners with this issue. I will be exploring the possibility of a class action against Jeep-Chrysler, among other causes of action for this abusive and elusive warranty scam.",0
"I purchase my vehicle with 33k on it 3 weeks ago. It is in for service for the 3rd time (I haven't even made a payment yet). 4 times now the transmission drags when leaving a stop and then clunks into gear. Before the 2nd service visit, I was driving down the highway and a loud alarm went off (not a ding or a chime) and there was something red on the display but it was gone before I could read it. My heart was jumping out of my chest as I was in rush hour interstate traffic and I thought it was going to stop. No codes the 1st and 2nd time so nothing was done. This time there was a body something code and waiting to hear on that today. At close to 36K I am concerned that I am entering the time when I start to have to pay for these services. I feel like I am being pacified at this point with no resolution to the issue. 
      I mentioned all of the similar concerns reported on the internet and was told ''you can't always believe everything you read''. My response was ""I am not lying about what is happening and I find it pretty interesting that others would report the same exact issues if they weren't having them."" I have filed a case with a LEMON LAW lawyer and just opened a case with JEEP/CHRYSLER directly. I love how it drives and looks but not sure how to rank the value. At this point it is going to cost me tons to repair down the road.",0
"I have purchased a brand new 2016 Jeep Latitude. 900 miles in, I notice a high pitch noise coming from undercarriage. When I shift into neutral the sound goes away. I took in to the dealer in fulton missouri for service on the issue. They clearly could hear the noise but the diagnostic machine shows no issues. They called Chrysler corp. Chrysler told them that they were aware of the problem but do not know what it is, they are working on it. They said there is no fix as of now and the dealer has just sent me home with this defective vehicle. I'm reporting this because I want others to be aware of this problem before they run down to purchase this vehicle. Basically they want me to just drive it until whatever is wrong breaks all the way down. This is my first new vehicle, I'm not sure really what to do. 
      The fulton dealer is willing to take it as a trade in but they are trying to talk me out of that and finally took me to a 2015 with close to 30,000 miles on it as I wonder why someone traded that back in, hmm, maybe it had transmission problem too. They also offered an extended warranty on the problem. My thing is I have bought a brand new vehicle with a problem that more than likely is going to have more problems! I'm wondering if anyone has one of these vehicles with the same issue, or perhaps I've purchased what will become a lemon for sure. I've seen the transmission problems here on the 2014 and 2015 models. It looks to me like Chrysler has had this problem for a couple of years and I don't understand how they don't know what is wrong with their product. I paid 28000.00 for this vehicle and I will lose a couple thousand dollars if I trade it back in as it now has 1041 miles on it. I wish I would have seen these complaints before I went with a jeep product. The problem is I do like the vehicle, I took a long time to decide on this thing and went with what I liked best. Again does anyone have this vehicle who has not had any problems at all with it. I'm willing to trade for exact same one if there is a chance I've just picked a bad one in the bunch. I do think these corporations should not be able to stick you with a defective product right out the gate. I do understand there is a lemon law, but it has to be in many times for the same thing and as of now there is no record of a repair because they don't know what to repair! Very upset about my first new car experience.UPDATED ON 04/29/2016: My 2016 jeep Latitude is a 4x4. Like I said the high pitch noise goes away if the vehicle is shifted into park or neutral. With the vehicle in park, when I turn the 4x4 knob from auto to snow etc. I hear the high pitch ring shortly as it is switch into diff 4x4 options. Vehicle is still in the Park position. This leads me to believe this problem is in this 4x4 switch. I returned to the dealer to let them know what I had found. They said they would make a note. I also told them I had never in my life taken a vehicle into a mechanic who came out and told me ""yes there is something wrong with your vehicle but we don't know what it is"" and still could not believe Chrysler Corp mechanics don't have a clue.Perhaps they should hire me, as I have given them more info on the problem than they have given me. I also told them I have gone to the Ford Dealer here in Fulton and found they have a Chrysler lot in Illinois and are willing to take this vehicle in as a trade on a new vehicle with 3 miles that has no 4 wheel drive options on it. That was my request - get rid of the 4x4 and get rid of problem. Again I would like to know if anyone is having this issue with a 2016 Jeep latitude. I left the Fulton Chrysler dealer and within 20 min or so I was being called by a salesman.Now mind you the salesman calling me is not even the one who sold me the vehicle in the first place. He ducks me when I go in. So salesman calls me and says ""we don't want to lose your business"" and to give them a chance before I trade in to ford. I tell them I want a new vehicle with the same low miles. That was 20 miles when I purchased it the first time. I understood I had 1041 miles on this one but I was removing the add on of the 4x4 to a fwd instead. I still wanted the v6 option and they could even drop the 8.0 u connect. These 2 add ons equal a little over 2000 dollars. I was interested in a even trade out. Or they could just purchase this vehicle back from me.Well that statement got a stutter from the salesman. They call me back maybe 45 min later. They tell me they have good news and bad news. The good news is they can even trade for a model that has no v6, no power seat, no 8.0 uconnect. No 4x4. Or they can give me exactly what I want - no 4x4, no 8.0 uconnect, I'll have power seats and v6 engine but it will cost me 2995.00. Oh and they will give me 25000.00 for my trade in. Which I paid 28000.00 for. So Ive lost 3000.00 on the price, I've dropped over 2000.00 in options and they want another 2995.00 to do the deal. Does not sound like a deal to me. I still have my vehicle and am waiting on Ford Dealer to call with their deal. Still don't know what will happen.",0
"Fuel blow back is well documented on the internet with Jeep and Chrysler models. Recalls have been initiated on some models, namely 2007-2009 Wrangler but the problem has not resulted in mass recalls. This is clearly a huge safety and liability issue for Jeep which could easily result in bodily injury, death or large loss of property as result of what is clearly a manufacturing defect. The check valve for the fuel system unlike other cars is not located in the fuel filler tube, it is in the tank itself. The cost to diagnose the problem was $146.50 and the cost to repair (replacing the entire fuel tank) is $1370.81 for a total out of pocket expense of $1517.31.
      The car is a single owner purchased new with only 28k miles. Fuel tanks are meant to last the lifetime of a vehicle where no collision or other mishap has occurred. There is nothing a consumer can do to mitigate, meaning no means of servicing or maintenance should be necessary. Waiting on a certain number of specific complaints or a class action lawsuit to address a problem is unacceptable. DO NOT BUY A JEEP OR CHRYSLER PRODUCT.",0
"I have had NOTHING but problems since I purchased a Jeep. RECALLS that do NOT HAPPEN, years pass, then they supposedly fix it and soon afterwards you have major problems. The p41 recall is a joke and a scam. They never had the proper part to fix the problem. They were getting a lot of complaints and having to pay for rental vehicles for people who complained to their attorney generals. Then they lie to you and tell you the part is available when it isn't. When you catch them in their LIE, they back off and wait a few months and then tell you the part is available. Shortly thereafter, your starter is fried??? This company is evil to the bone and if you are a FOOL...then go buy a Jeep.",0

After another 20,000 miles, the same plate failed. This time the assembly part was $725. With labor totaled $954. Totally dissatisfied with that manufacturer design. Will never consider another Jeep as long as they use that design. Chrysler Jeep has no recall on this item, but they should. Customer service rep was very nice, but they don't do a recall unless there enough complaints. With the part being so readily available they must get a lot of replacements requests. Need more complaints.",0
"So I have a 2012 Jeep Patriot that at 107,000 miles dropped the tranny. It had a 100,000 mile warranty. I brought it into Macdonald motors in Bridgton, ME at 87,000 miles because it was acting up. They told me it was the spark plugs, not the transmission. It's the junk CVT, so I changed the plugs thinking I just wasn't used to that style of tranny. Helped with the skipping but not the hesitation and dead spot on take offs. In June we were getting ready to head to Moosehead for vacation and it started getting worse. I drove it right over to them again and asked to have it looked at before we left in case I needed to leave it. They sent a guy out, he drove it and said it was fine. This was still during the warranty period. They never made a record of it. Less than 10,000 miles later it completely quits, failing every test they can do. 
      At this point it is now out of warranty- amazing how that happens isn't it. Because it is over warranty and Macdonald motors doesn't show multiple complaints on it, I am stuck with the entire $4000 bill. There was obviously something wrong with it the whole time and Macdonald was avoiding the warranty, with jeep playing right along. Between me, my inlaws and my father we have bought 7 jeeps since 2000. There will not be another. I suggest everyone avoid Chrysler products, especially jeeps, and do not trust Macdonald motors. Your warranty means nothing.",0
"THE ACCURATE PART - Purchased in November 2015 2005 Jeep Liberty Renegade. 1/22/16 in the evening, my 16 year old son had JUST gotten off the highway and was coming into town (at 25 mph thankfully), felt a jerk and heard a noise. Pulled over immediately. Bottom line, the control arms were rusted the whole way through... recall issue. I called them and they said they would pay for tow. I have tried relentlessly (sometimes nicely and sometimes not so nicely) to get them to pay for the 2 day rental that I had to pay for while the truck was in the shop. They said they wouldn't because it was outside their ""parameters"". THE FAIR PART - Buyer beware, check recalls etc BEFORE purchasing. 
      LESSON LEARNED (for both me, my friends and my 16 year old son and anyone that will listen to me) - NEVER buy Jeep Chrysler. They may or may not (typically not from what I am reading) provide you with acceptable customer service. The inconvenience is typical, that's life. But for me to have to pay out of pocket for their subpar equipment... not acceptable. The local dealership was friendly and as helpful as they could be considering all they really needed to do was fix the recall item (I did have them repair another separate issue at my cost). They were quick to get it repaired. I dealt with Aaron and thought he was professional and friendly.",0
"We have an 2010 Jeep Liberty Limited with a Sky Slider Roof that from the time we bought it used has been nothing but trouble. We bought the jeep two and half years ago from a Chrysler dealer. It was warrantied and after a week and half of ownership we took it in and had the roof checked out. It would not slide open from the back and a made a clicking noise. After much complaints and phone calls the dealership had it repaired but it took at least 1.5 weeks for the repair of roof because they didn't have a person that knew how to fix the problem. The noise is so loud that you can't enjoy your radio or conversations. The dealership said they did the repair out of courtesy and that I would had to pay over $1500 for the repair. Now, the roof is broken again and will not close all the way!!! I have been looking to find someone who knows how to fix it but no one will touch them. These roofs should be on recall!!!",0
"I purchased this 2007 Jeep Commander when it was 2 years old. It still had a factory warranty. It has been nothing but a piece of garbage. This is by far the worst vehicle that I have ever owned, or that anyone I know has ever owned. Nothing but a pile of troubles. Windows never worked right, sometimes they went up, and sometimes they get stuck (elect). Water leaks through the sunroof tubes because of poor design. They need to be cleaned out twice a year or my car will be soaking wet and leaking from the handles and down through the doors to the floor. When heater turns on, makes loud squealing sounds, and to turn heat off you have to hit the ac switch. Seats also had bad wiring and would not adjust back and forth.
      I do regular maintenance on my car every three months, and my vehicle is garage kept. Ever since I had this Jeep, it stalls, won't start on first crank intermittently, shuts off while driving, and windshield wipers work when they decide to go on for no apparent reason. When I take it for service, no one sees anything wrong with it. No codes, no problems when test driving. Everytime I get this Commander out of the garage, two months later it is being towed in for another problem. In the last 15 months, I have had to replace the oil pan (really??? Rusted completely through), water pump, fuel pump, leaking transmission lines (poor design, rubbing together), crank sensor, and NOW to my amazement the ECM.Really??? I want to puke. Got to fix it, so that I can get rid of it. Because I NEVER want to look at another Jeep/Chrysler product again. I really hate the fact that someone else has to get this money trap junk. Because that is exactly what it is!!! When this Jeep hit 100,000 miles, which was 15 months ago, it has proved to be moneymaker for Jeep parts and labor, and a real unreliable vehicle for the owner. Let's not forget all the electrical and design problems it has had from the start. I am still at a shock about the computer system going bad. Yeah 1400.00, that never should have happened!!! I cannot wait to get it fixed and get it out of my name.",0
"This car is such a lemon and even worse. FCA never would honor even the basic warranty. I owned this POS for 8 months and was overjoyed when I was able to trade it. The transmission is the worst shifting vehicle ever and it was useless as a 4WD because the transmission would overheat and disable 4WD every time it went off road. Nine trips to two different dealers and they just repeat the BS phrase of ""Operating as Intended"" and ""Can't duplicate the problem"". The car is dangerous in traffic and breaks down off road, a total disaster. I will never buy a Fiat Chrysler again and think this corporation should be prosecuted for out and out fraud for not honoring warranties. Customer Care is just a time wasting charade that goes on and on for months.",0
"I purchased a new Jeep Patriot in June of 2010. I used the car to commute to work for about 10 months before changing jobs to work from home. For four years, the car was driven very little and at the time of this review it has less than 33k miles on it. I noticed a loud noise anytime the clutch was not engaged so I took it to the dealership. It turns out vehicle, at 33k miles, needs a new transmission, and of course, the powertrain warranty expired 4 months ago. ""Linda"" from Jeep customer services ""fully appreciates my concern"" particularly regarding the expense ($4800+). She ""appreciates the opportunity to review your request"", but... you know how the rest goes. My recommendation is not to fall in love with these cars, and definitely don't purchase from a company that doesn't stand by their product.",0
"I purchased my Jeep Grand Cherokee Eco GC Diesel in September 2014 and since then I have had multiple issues. Check Engine light constantly goes on and they say it needs to be updated when serviced... Well service doesn't do this regularly. Filled up my DEF with the same stuff I always fill it up with and all of a sudden when driving home it states ""Incorrect DEF fluid. See dealership."" Then all my lights start to flash and I get a message that says ""Engine will NOT restart in 175 KM."" Well it's Sunday and no freaking dealership service department is open. Not impressed!! When you buy a $60,000 new vehicle it should not have issues like this. 
      Camrose and Sherwood Park dealerships: When I bought from Camrose dealership they never even told me it needed DEF so just about ran out. Also when I asked if I could get the oil changed anywhere they said yes... Well guess what? You can't. You can only get it changed at a dealership as they do not sell the filters to anyone BUT the dealerships. Took it into Sherwood Park dealership to get it serviced and have the updates done and guess what? They charged me an outrageous to get the oil change and then never even did the updates. Asked them to do the updates and they said I would have to book an appointment with the service department. When I went to book an appointment they didn't even know what I was wanting when asking for them to update the computer system. Thirdly Asked them to clear the check engine light so I could at least use my command start and the Techs there didn't even know how to do this. Super frustrated with my Jeep and both dealerships.",0
"I own a 2009 Jeep Patriot and my transmission went out. Since I bought it new and it came with a lifetime powertrain warranty, which includes the transmission, I didn't think getting it repaired would be a problem. Little did I know that in order for the warranty to remain effective, you must have the transmission inspected within the first 5 years of ownership. That little fact was never revealed to me even though I have had all required maintenance performed by the dealership. Has anyone else had this problem and what was down to resolve it short of paying for the repair - which is going to run $4,200.",1
"Ground squirrels chewed through the wire to my horn and I took my Jeep in to the dealer. They said the warranty did not cover the repair job, and said it would take 1 and 1/2 hours to fix. The Jeep Sat in the lot for 45 minutes before they said it was ready and charged me 150.00 dollars to fix the horn wire. I told them it should have been covered and that I would let their competitors know that the Mighty Jeep is not rodent proof! They laughed and took my money. I had a GMC Sierra for 17 years and never had any rodent problems. I think Jeep has a design problem. I looked into rodent problems online and found this to be more common a problem that most would think. Will wait for the class action lawsuit to get my money back! I have a receipt of the transaction, have contacted Jeep with no reply yet. I also contacted GMC, Chevy, Toyota and Ford. So far GMC and Chevy have responded. I thought they would be interested in Jeep problems.",0

"2011 Jeep Cherokee Headliner Fire - August 20th I was driving near Maryville, Tn. when the headliner started burning and filled the vehicle up with smoke. I pulled over and jerked the headliner down and saw flames. I was able to get the fire out and get the vehicle home. A lot of things do not work now including turn signals and wipers. New fuses do not help. I called the local dealership the next day and found out that Jim Codgill Dodge in Knoxville did a recall repair on a recall concerning headliner fires. I took the car to Jim Codgill and got the run around even though they did the repairs. They told me I had to call Chrysler. I spent three hours on the phone with Chrysler and finally gave up and went home. End result - nothing has been done to date.",0
"My name is Joseph **. I bought a 2015 Jeep Renegade and in 4 months this vehicle has let me down. Once, the door locks were not locking and the alarm would come on. Second time, I went to a AT&T about 1 hr from where I live, after going back to my Jeep it would not start. Then I called through the assist button and no luck, no answer. Two hours after tow truck came and took me to get nearest Jeep dealer Firkins in Sarasota. At that time they were closed. Then I had to call a taxi to take me to the airport so I can get a rented car so I could have gotten out from this stranded situation. The next 2 days I had to miss work because I was told that they will try to fit me in so I could get my Jeep and etc. I am a loyal customer and I felt like Jeep just drop the ball and wouldn't never recommend or ever go back to Jeep. This Jeep was bought at Greenway Jeep in Orlando and the people who works there do not care about customers.",0

"I've noticed when I get into a Jeep Patriot (this has happened in 4 separate Jeep Patriots) that my mouth starts to taste like cotton and I have a hard time breathing. So far, I have not found anyone that has had the same experience as me. My friend who purchased a Jeep Patriot said he noticed it a little bit but nothing severe. My boyfriend then bought a Patriot even after I told him of this side effect (smh). Instantly when entering the vehicle, I start tasting this cotton taste in my mouth and my throat starts to close up. Now I know there is a certain chemical either in the AC used in this vehicle or the powered plastic they use for the dash. Has anyone else experienced the same issue? I've searched the internet high and low to see if anyone has this problem, and I haven't had any luck. Are there any latex products used in the making of this vehicle? Please, if anyone has had the same allergy or knows what the cause is reply.",0

"After the hitch recall was conducted I have lost capabilities of my vehicle due to the manufacturer (JEEP). I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty CRD delivered by Jeep with a trailer hitch and wiring. The tow rating of 5000lbs was the only reason the jeep was purchased with the benefit of a diesel engine for better mpg. I was informed by mail a recall was necessary to prevent damage to the fuel tank and fire in case of an accident. When I asked the service manager at Ourisman Jeep in Clarksville, MD, I was told the N46 recall consisted of an inspection of the installed hitch and a possible replacement hitch if the original failed inspection. I was told there should be no other issues. When I got the Jeep back, I was told the hitch was replaced and I was ""good to go"". 
      While waiting on the Jeep, I read the paperwork which stated my vehicle did not come equipped for towing (it did come equipped for towing) and that I could not tow with the hitch that was now installed. I asked about this and was told by the service manager at Ourisman it was just legalese to cover their butt and not to worry, tow as before. I became concerned as I use the Jeep regularly to tow and have not used it since as I am concerned if the tow hitch Ourisman installed fails I will be held liable as Jeep says I cannot tow in the paperwork. I emailed jeep and received the following: ""Thank you for contacting the Jeep Customer Assistance Center. We regret to learn of your concerns regarding the ability to tow with this new hitch. We regret to inform you that we are unable to diagnose or advise if your vehicle is safe regarding if you can tow with this new trailer hitch that was installed. There are too many variables involved and a detailed inspection of your vehicle is required for proper diagnosis. If you choose to use the new hitch for towing, you are responsible for any damage it may or may not cause.""Based on that I wrote back asking why I went from a vehicle that could tow to one that couldn't and why it wasn't mentioned previously. The response was: ""We reviewed your concerns further in regards to obtain further clarification on if you are able to tow with this new hitch. FCA US LLC and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have agreed on this repair action. The repair procedure set out by FCA US LLC meets these requirements that were set out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The trailer-hitch assemblies installed as part of this campaign are intended only to provide rear structural reinforcement. Hitch-balls were not to be installed and customers are not advised to operate their vehicles with exposed hitch-balls. We apologize this information does not assist you with your concerns; however, we must stand behind our decision to advise you not to tow with this hitch.""I am unsure who else to actually contact as the manufacturer and the dealer have now basically stolen from me the only reason I own the vehicle. I also don't understand how they would replace a hitch when I told them I use it for towing and later say it wasn't their call. I did email the BBB, they should respond in 30 days. I contacted NHTSA and received this in response: ""Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Transportation's Vehicle Safety Hotline Information Center. For recall inquiries on your specific vehicle, safety seat, or other equipment please contact the manufacturer. We hope that you find this information helpful. However, if you need additional information on our services please feel free to contact us at 1-888-327-4236.""I started out just wanting the jeep back to where I can tow. But since Jeep refuses and is saying that it was approved by NHTSA to get lost or at least that's what the last email from Jeep seems to say, I don't want it anymore as I can't use it. Now I think based on the paperwork I likely can't even sell the jeep to anyone planning to tow as even though it was rated to tow it now has paperwork saying not to. And even had Jeep offered to buy it back and give credit toward buying another Jeep/Chrysler/Dodge I won't. I won't buy another Chrysler product after this. This has completely turned me off the Company, even though I have been a lifelong Mopar Enthusiast, having owned a 68 Roadrunner, 87 Ram and a 2002 Quad Cab Dakota that was one of my previous tow vehicles. So now I have to begin a search for another vehicle that meets the need the Liberty was filling so I can have a vehicle to tow with; the ideal being a small 4x4 with a tow capacity of at least 5000lbs. And find a way to sell or trade the Jeep as I cannot justify continuing making payments on a vehicle I cannot use due to the fast one pulled by Jeep.",0
I purchased a Jeep which turned out to have a tpms warning light on. Took Jeep to Turnersville Jeep who said it needed a new wireless control module. Agreed to have them replaced the wireless control module for 263 dollars. Picked up jeep after service department was closed only to find tpms light still on. Took the jeep back to Turnersville Jeep and they had it for two more weeks and still couldn't fix problem. Decide to try a different dealership to see if they could fix it. Pellegrino Jeep had car for over a week with no success. I can't believe a car that they made they cannot fix. Such an annoying problematic. I forgot to mention that the accessory position does not work and they couldn't fix that problem. I'm at my wits end. Can anyone fix these two problems?,0
"I purchased my 2008 Jeep Liberty in 9/2011 - 18,000 miles. I have had consistent problems with the sky slider roof, which is now being held on by duck tape. It will not close at all. Sounds like I'm in a tunnel driving. The noise is deafening. It's came off track before and I got it back on track, but now it won't close or open or nothing so using duck tape is my last resort. I can't afford the ridiculous price of getting it fixed. Tempted to glue it shut. This is very annoying and not my first time as a jeep owner but it will be my last. Someone needs to do something. This could cause major damage to anyone driving behind me as it has come close to flying off. I can't get it to close at all and now I have water damage beyond repair to my interior. So much for jeeps.",0
"I am 65 years old, and purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty on June 12, 2014. I had no idea of the fuel tank installed behind the rear axle. Prior to purchase, I had done a CarFax report that revealed no recalls. Shortly thereafter I received a notice of recall on the trailer hitch and waited 9 months for the replacement hitch to be available and had it replaced at the Chrysler dealership. No one ever told me about the gas tank mounting behind the rear axle and that 75 people had been burnt to death in rear collisions. Now I am stuck with a vehicle I still owe $8000 on and no one wants to buy. It is sad that our National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Chrysler don't care about our safety and that a band aid of a trailer hitch could protect lives from a fuel tank explosion in a rear end collision over 40 mph.",0
"I called last week to simply find out a price on a vehicle. I spoke to Trevor who kept me on the phone for 20 minutes trying to get me to come down there to purchase this same vehicle. I told him there was no way I was driving 4 hours to be disappointed and come home with nothing. I've had over 12 vehicles and I know how this operation works. I told him about my proposal I have with a dealer here and the price they were giving me for my trade. They unfortunately didn't have the color jeep I wanted. He guaranteed that he could get me to a payment of $300 or under. I still said I don't believe it and will not drive there until I know you can sell this vehicle for this amount and that I have it in writing. At this point he said even if we lose money we want your business. I told him I'd call Monday since I'd be away all weekend. In the meantime my friend Greg also called and spoke to Trevor about numbers and he promised he could get us there. 
      So last evening we made the 2-hour one-way drive to find out it was all a lie. The numbers were way off. You wouldn't give me the discount promised. I left absolutely devastated. My suggestion to Trevor and the rest of your team is not to make empty promises to prospective buyers. You wasted 5 hours of driving and caused a lot of heartache. I will never recommend anyone to your dealership. As matter of fact, I will tell everyone I know to steer clear. I will be writing a letter to Jeep corporate customer satisfaction on how no one there would take any responsibility for their dishonest actions and misleading representations over the phone. Especially with a new salesperson they have on staff that is representing them. They promised $11,500 for my trade and $2300 in rebates. We got there and they would only discount the jeep $1165 and would only give me $10,000 for my car.",0
"Where do I begin? I bought this Jeep brand new and outright with 36 miles when I drove it off the lot. It was great until 40,000 miles I had to replace everything in the front end. Mind you this vehicle is not used for off road. It is used for basic daily driving to and from work, errands, etc. After that was replaced I made a turn only to have scalding hot water pour into my driving foot while wearing sandals. I took it back to the dealership and asked to be notified of the problem before it was fixed. I was not called until the end of the day when I was told to pick up my vehicle. I was then told it was a clogged AC unit and was charged $300. They did the work without my consent. The troubles kept coming after that! About a year ago while driving down the road, my car began to violently shake with my daughter in the vehicle with me. My tie rod broke while driving about 40mph. 
      Luckily I did not crash and was able to gain control of the vehicle and pull off the road. That makes the second time things in the front end were replaced all before 100,000 miles. I am now over 100,000 and no longer have a warranty. Two months ago I paid 1,000 for engine issues. My traction control light is always on, now my check oil light is on and dinging over and over while driving. There is a sensor failure that informs the car of the oil pressure. I have plenty of oil. Then I went to leave for work and my Jeep would not release the shifter out of park. Upon research this is an electrical issue where the transmission does not recognize the brake is being pressed to release the vehicle out of park. I was finally able to get it out. My blower motor for the hot and cold air does not work and needs to be replaced. I also have paint bubbling up right above the windshield and the roof of the vehicle. Not sure if this is related but in New England winters like this past one where we have a ton of snow and ice I have water that leaks into my interior light and comes through the light. So basically my car sucks and I thought I would at least be able to get two more years before I had to buy a new vehicle but this is not the case. I am having more and more issues! So from 40,000 to its current 119,000 this car has been nothing but a headache! I am so disappointed and so badly want to call Chrysler and tell them all the issues I've had in a basically brand new vehicle (I know it's not now but at 40,000 it still was). I've owned many Jeeps over the years and I will not be purchasing another Jeep!!! I don't feel safe even driving to work in this POS!!! It looks nice on the outside but just ask me about the anxiety, stress, headache and money this vehicle has cost me and you won't think it's so nice!!!",0
"I purchased my jeep in February of 2015 from Mancari's Chrysler in Oak Lawn, IL. My experience with the purchase was horrific, as they sold me a 2 wheel drive for the price of an 4X4. Tried to tell me I had an 4X4, but my insurance company stated that according to the VIN it was a 2x4. They argued with me back and forth before they finally said the insurance company was right. You would think they would give me a 4x4, no, they did not without me having to put an additional 2 thousand dollars down on it. Okay, I did that. Got my 4x4 and moved on. Then I get the recall notice for R01. Took it in of course and afterwards, the Jeep did not drive the same. A lot of jerking/coughing going on. When I stop at a light, and when the light turns green, I go forward, the Jeep stalls before it would go. Same thing occurs when I make a turn. It could cause someone to run into me from the back because the Jeep stalls. 
      Okay, took it back in, but then I got the recall for a R05. So while getting the second recall done, they were going to look at the issues I explained as well. When I left they said they looked at it and all was fine. Well everything was not fine, it continued to do the same thing. Took it back. They tells me that my 9.V engine is causing the Jeep to do that, and that is the way it is and nothing is wrong with it. On the way home, my entire dashboard goes dark and the ceiling light keeps popping on and off. The next day the check engine lights comes on. Took it back in, but to a different Jeep service department. They had it all day, only to tell me nothing was wrong. That was two days ago. Today while driving to the train station, my check engine light comes on again. WTF!!! Jeep is a piece of JUNK. Please DO NOT PURCHASE A JEEP!!!",0
"Bought a Jeep patriot in 2012. All of the plastic on interior was just hanging due to plastic clips breaking. Took to dealership because of skipping and poor acceleration from stop in automatic. It whined and smelled like something burning while going uphills and even in lower gears struggled. Occasionally, when I would start car, it would sound like it was going to throw motor through the hood. Their tech told me that they just have crappy transmission and it would get worse with time and mileage but said they couldn't do anything about it because ""technically"" there's nothing wrong with it. Traded Jeep in and couldn't be happier! Will never own another Jeep or Chrysler product again.",0
"2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited - Never liked how my transmission shifted but was told by salesman that is how the 9 speed reacted. Received recall in April 2015 for PCM and TCM. Had the updates installed. Informed Jeep dealership there was an issue with my tranny. Made appt on Jun 25, 2015. They couldn't verify my concern but would note it as such. Stated they did install a new flash update. On July 1, 2015 I was stopped at an intersection. Light turned green, partway through intersection my jeep came to an instant stop. My park sense, ignition, and crash warning lights went off as well as my transmission. I could not get my vehicle started. After several attempts it started and as I shifted to drive I heard a loud clanking sound. I was able to hobble the jeep to the dealership. 
      As of today, July 7th, they have ordered a valve body and transmission wiring harness. My vehicle has less than 9000 miles. The instant stall could have caused a serious accident with the potential for a fatality. Thank goodness it was during early morning hours. I am very frustrated as Jeep knew there were issues with these transmissions yet they placed them on the market. I still owe several thousand dollars on this rig that I now fear will continue to have issues. I do not know how long it will take to receive the parts and complete the repair.",0

So I had to wait for a tow for over 45 minutes and the tow person told me that it was a broken rear suspension control arm and he said that there was a recall on this for 2004 and 2005 Jeep Liberties.
      So I called Woodhouse in Blair and was informed that because my vehicle wasn't put together in the right state that my Vin# wasn't on the recall list. This is a bunch of B.S. I have purchased Three Jeeps. But I will never again purchase a Chrysler product. They have lost my business forever. If the part is defective it should go for all Jeep Liberty's. Just because you don't live in the right state they won't cover it. Chrysler Corporation SUCKS!!! I Hope your corporation goes Bankrupt it will serve you right. And let's hope no one gets killed in an accident that is the cause of your company not wanting to fix something that has been recalled, but they won't fix it because the car wasn't put together in the correct State.",0
"Brand new 2014 jeep wrangler Rubicon started malfunction at 5000 miles. Lights shorting out, tpms fully malfunctioning and doesn't recognize where any of my tires are even after 3 new modules replaced. My radio now doesn't work as it goes nuts with the buttons flashing etc. when car is on and the worst part is my Jeep turning on by itself in my driveway middle of night without the keys!!! They have had me into dealership for 7 months now. 12 plus visits, over 5 rental cars and to this day I have no answers. The resolution department does nothing but make you run in circles and has not offered to help in any way. I spent over $50,000 on this top of line Jeep to get no accountability from the manufacturer on these problems. 
      When their own dealership told me to hire a lawyer AND the customer service dept of Jeep says the same thing after looking over my STAR report.... well looks like I'm getting a lawyer. Lucky I live in California where they have to give me every penny back, my down payment and pay for my lawyer. I used to love my Jeep. Now I just have a bad taste in my mouth from this company.",0
2015 Jeep - The transmission that whines when I pull off and stop. Understand the Jeep have 9 gears.,0
"I purchased 2013 Jeep Patriot Latitude in January of 2013. Since the car was purchased, I have had nothing but problems. The first issue was that the windshield wipers kept turning on by themselves. I took the car back to the dealership's service department only to be told that a ''star case'' was made. No resolution. The second issue that occurred was where the car completely stalled out at 10 MPH which nearly caused a terrible accident that could have injured myself and my 9 year old daughter. I had to turn the car off, wait and then turn it back on. The car stalled again. After 20 minutes of waiting, the car began to drive as normal. I took the car back to the dealership AGAIN. The service manager kept my Jeep for the entire day (keep in mind that they do not even issue rentals) and called to tell me that ANOTHER STAR CASE was made.
      After my third visit for the stalling issue and for the windshield wipers, the dealership finally decided to change the wipers relay switch which seemed to stop the problem. After 5 visits for the stalling issue, there still has not been any resolution. I have contacted Jeep over three times, via phone and by the email on the site and still have yet to be contacted from the ''representative in one business day.'' I am furious that I cannot get any type of satisfactory service. I will NEVER purchase another Chrysler product. I have began exploring other options for a new vehicle which is sad being that I am a single father who just needs reliable transportation to provide for his daughter. Oh by the way, today is 5/15/15, I had to take my Jeep into the service dealership at 10:15AM EST for yet another diagnostic check.",0
"Sometimes my Jeep Liberty '05 will stall while I'm driving, many time when I'm making a turn! This is so scary that I stopped driving it when it's raining, because that's usually when it happens. I called Chrysler and they said it's my responsibility to maintain my vehicle. We have 4 and the jeep is the only one that malfunctions. They'll have a huge lawsuit on their hands, or they could just fix the issue with all jeeps. There are thousands of complaints online about this issue and something needs to be done about it or someone will get killed driving their jeep! My daughter drives it sometimes and it scares her too! I'll never own another jeep!",0
"First - I never wanted a Jeep, but my husband came home one day and just like on the ads he said, ""I bought a Jeep!"" You did what??? I didn't believe my ears! Without even asking or talking about it!!! And he repeats again with a cheeky smile. Then I realise he isn't joking... I was not impressed! Eventually he got me to try it. Must admit he made a fine choice. Amazing value for money, drives very nice and great fuel economy. Highly recommended. The local dealership (Perth, WA) isn't providing first class after sales experience when it comes to it, but there is no fault I can find with this vehicle. Love the seat warmers too. :)",1
"While on an out of town trip, the car's dashboard display notified me that I needed to get to a dealership within 200 miles. Since I was in rural Arizona, it was difficult to find a dealer, but I managed. 10 weeks later, my car still isn't repaired. Chrysler's customer service has been erratic and unhelpful, they claim that there are problems locating the parts needed to repair the car. Most disappointing, however, is the company's complete lack of concern for my dilemma. My personal expenses have been significant, the company barely communicates with me, and won't commit to anything at all. No car, no repair, no compensation and above all, NO APOLOGIES.",0
"Jeep Laredo 2014 4x4 - Like everyone says, Chrysler really does suck!! Transmission problems on 33k miles shifter recalls, wheel alignment shifts to the right. Transmission kick down to 50 when doing 60mph, dangerous. Chrysler will not help. They know everyone is having the same problem and their priority is to have the vehicle fixed so everyone buy one so they all sit in the shop while they get paid and we pay bs. Anyone know of a lawyer something? It's time the U.S. opens their eyes because they think they will always get away with it. It's not just one vehicle, it’s multiple vehicles. Chrysler tells you they will fix it while people are being told the same thing. Well you go ahead believe that.",0
"The stalling turned out to be 'intended functionality'.  It is a feature of the 'economy mode' designed to conserve fuel.  This feature can be turned off, but I feel that it would be better as a selectable option and not default.
  The acceleration performance was improved via a transmission controller software update.Original Review: March 22, 2015Jeep Cherokee 2015 stalling on stop. Poor to moderate performance on acceleration from stop.",1
"I have had a number of issues with my '09 Jeep Patriot, I am not sure where to begin. I've still have a leaky sunroof that I've given up on ever getting repaired. My Patriot was at the dealer (Hickman Motors) for almost 2 months trying to find a problem with a defective driver's side airbag switch, only to finally discover that it wasn't connected properly by the technician who did the diagnostics. 
      Backtrack. When I purchased the Patriot from Hickman Motors, it had less than 60,000 Km on it. The salesman (**) told me that it had 2 years, Bumper to Bumper, left on the Extended Service Warranty that covered everything except oil changes, wipers, tires, brakes, etc. Shortly after purchasing the vehicle, I noticed that the gearshift would occasionally pop out of gear and the shiftier knob, itself, would pop off. This issue was bought to the attention of the service department on several occasions. After replacing the shiftier knob, they determined that the transmission was ok. The problem progressively got worse, to the point that I would have to turn off the engine in order to change into 1st or reverse gear.Long story short, now that the vehicle is no longer under warranty, they advise me that parts in the transmission need to be replaced and it would cost me approximately $2000. I spoke with the dealer and the Chrysler ""could -care -less"" rep and was told that there was nothing they could do because the warranties have expired. All I received was an apology from Chrysler and deniability and avoidance from the dealer that this problem was an ongoing issue (even though I have documentation to the contrary). I eventually took the Patriot to a specialty transmission shop and had the transmission repaired with ""quality parts' for less than have the dealer quote. I am pursuing this matter further. I simply wanted to voice my concerns and caution prospective automotive buyers to stay away from Jeep products.PS: The issue with the rear end trailer arm assembly and suspension is another big problem that I will probably post about another day. Thank you for listening.",0
"I was sent a recall notice July 2014 regarding the ignition switch but was also told the part was not available to fix the problem. Several months passed and I contacted Jeep and was told again...""we'll let you know when the part is available."" It's now 8 months later and STILL the part is not available. Meanwhile, I have to drive with no key ring (which has caused me to lose the key several times), and the real issue is that it could cause an accident. Why can't a million dollar corporation such as chrysler fix a defect that their company is responsible for and could cause an accident and loss of life? I could understand waiting a month or two for the part, but 8 months and still no idea when the part will be available is just wrong and totally unacceptable.",0
"Purchased this vehicle and discovered its 9 speed transmission did not use 9th gear. After multiple visits to service dept. I was finally told I would probably never see 9th gear as it was developed more for the European market where speeds could reach above 80 mph. Many squeaks, and odd noises, no answers. Very jerky acceleration or very large delay, no fix for that either as it is a 9 speed electronic transmission. Very disappointed in this purchase as I have owned Chrysler/Jeep for over 20 years and this is by far the worst vehicle I have had with their name on it.",0
"After purchasing a 2014 Jeep Patriot, we have had issues with the throttle body multiple times. Everything from cutting out in traffic to now accelerating on its own. We took it in to Huntington Beach Jeep who then put 220 miles on our vehicle and stated they could not replicate the issue. I was able to replicate the issue 4 times in 1 day!! By the time I was done with all of the ""add ons"" they said I absolutely needed, I paid WELL over sticker price for this vehicle and to have it in the shop 3 times in the last 7 months is ridiculous. I will NEVER buy anything from Jeep again.",0
"I purchased a 2013 Jeep Rubicon of Valentine's Day 2014 from Bob Baker Jeep in Carlsbad CA including a Premium Maintenance Package for my wife. It has been a struggle to get the maintenance performed on the vehicle (oil and tire rotation). The front tires were wearing irregular causing a really rough ride and a lot of noise. I took it to the first dealer twice and they indicated that there was no problem. I called Chrysler Customer Care and they sent me to Big O Tires for an inspection. Big O said the tires were bad due to a suspension issue. I took the Jeep to a second dealership and they said it was not a car problem and it was a tire problem. This evaluation was done solely by a visual inspection. I called Customer care back and they had me take it back to the dealer for yet another inspection. 
      They determined that there was no problem in the suspension. They determined that that the tires needed to be rotated very 6K miles or at every oil change. The premium maintenance package that was sold to me which was specifically for the Rubicon only specifies rotation to be done every 10K miles. At this point customer care says it's not their problem. The dealer has only offered to pick up half of the cost (their retail price) of 2 new tires and will not change the maintenance plan to meet the minimum recommended maintenance (ie. tire rotation at every oil chance). Or I can buy another maintenance plan. I will NEVER buy another Chrysler!!!!!PS. I was able to work with BF Goodrich and independent tire dealer (Americas Tire) to get 2 new tires for the same price as the half off price of the Chrysler dealership. It includes tire rotation for the life of the tire for free. The customer care group at Chrysler have been the worst group I have ever dealt with!!!!!!!! They don't return calls or respond.",0
"I bought 2009 Jeep Liberty. 2 years the heat just blows cold air. Because I didn't buy extended warranty I’m screwed. I have a blood disease, antiphospholipid antibody Syndrome. I can’t go out all winter because frozen temps both in and out. No heat, no defrosting, freezing windows inside. Estimate could be as much as 5000. I do not have the money. I am on ss and disability. I was told that they would have to remove the entire dash. You would think they know their heaters failed, they should creating an opening, bad design. Really angry but still no heat. Help!",0
"When my son was overseas, I took his Jeep Patriot in for recall work. I provided my phone number so they could contact me when the work was completed. Since then I have been pestered by a third party company who wants to sell me maintenance on the vehicle. I tell them I never owned the car and they say they will take me off the list but continue to call. I never gave Jeep permission to sell my private information to 3rd parties.",0
"2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Garbage: After owning foreign cars my entire life, I decided to try a Jeep. I purchased a JGC with only 6000 miles on it and a full warranty. I also purchased the extended warranty that has 7 years, 100,000 mile warranty since my Jeep is fully loaded with all of the options. I must recommend to other buyers that you should AVOID any Jeep products. My jeep has had so many issues and I have wasted so much time at the dealership, that I regret my purchase. The most significant issue is that my Jeep will die while in Drive and Reverse, thus making it very dangerous to drive. Everyone seems to have the same issues as well. Horrible customer service, regardless of where you are located. Chrysler is a horrible brand and they deserve to go bankrupt. I will never buy another American car again. It is sad that our own products are junk, but that is what Chrysler is. Even the case manager assigned to me from Chrysler is a blithering idiot who won't even return my calls.",0
Tried to stop & the jeep accelerated.,0
"Purchased a 2008 Jeep Patriot. I've had it for about, oh 3 years now. After reading everyone's stories, I am not sure if I want to eve go with a new vehicle, lol, only because since I have had my jeep. I have put 4 tie rod ends on this puppy as well as 4 ball joint in the last three yeas. And just yesterday, I went to pump my back tire up and I have another busted tire sensor making it the 3rd one have to replace. And now my brake drums needs replaced and check engine light has now came on. So thinking KIA is a great car, found out that will be the last car I will buy, and Ford no way Pontiac's ignition problem and Jeep Cherokee. I mean wow, at this point I think a horse would be more liable than America's crappy cars and customer service is something else.",0
"I have a 2008 Jeep Commander, most recently while at the stop light the engine shut off.... This is a scary situation to be in especially when young children are in the vehicle.

"2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredo - I lost control of my Jeep traveling 57-60 mph. I nosedived into a ditch, flipped over, and rolled sideways several times down a rural hwy, coming to rest upside down in a deep ditch facing the opposite direction in which I was traveling. Each roll my head slammed into the window. I did not have the strength to save myself. After the first hard slam I was just a flop. My daughter, her friend, and my 3 year old granddaughter was in the back seat. None of my air bags deployed. It's been almost a month and I still have a headache. I can't remember my phone number, people's names, or how to get into my accounts, and I'm still picking glass out of my head. Even after the several hour glass picking at the hospital. 
      My neck and shoulder makes horrible noises, and I can barely see out of my left eye. I was wearing my seat belt, but that did nothing for my head. I just bought a new vehicle, but I panic every time I think about leaving in it. I find myself sitting in parking lots for hours trying to get through panic attacks now. I'm terrified of driving now. I don't want to do it. Thank God the little one was asleep and covered up. She rolled with it. And the older kids were banged up, sore and cut up from glass. We are still all so happy to be alive. Most disappointing thing is that I paid a lot for that Jeep at 5 Corners in Cedarburg, for its safety features and they failed me badly.",0
"I buying Jeep Patriot 2014, 6 month ago I start heard noise first. The brake, when I back up make noise the pads. I brought the car to Jeep Chrysler. The mechanic told me that noise is normal, for me not, because is brand new car. So now I have squeak noise in the suspension, so I found out in Google cars noise problems. They show exactly the noise and the problem and where they need to fix. The car its not bad for the price but so many noise for brand new car. I hope this can help to anybody.",1
"This is my first Jeep after owning only Toyotas, but the last 2 Toyota trucks were nothing but trouble so I made a change and couldn't be happier. I have almost 3000 miles on the Jeep GC, it's a blast to drive from smooth ride to awesome features it was worth the change. I had it in to the dealer twice for alarm install and receiving hitch and both visits went smooth. My only complaint is the sales department wasn't that knowledgeable on service maintenance. I will say that problems happen how the Dealer and manufacture handle them can make or break us as consumers on buying there product again, and laws should become tougher so we the consumer are protected.",1
"I bought my jeep in August 2014. I first had problems with it September 26, 2014 with the transmission. The dealer fixed the issue and said things were fine. On November 8th, the lights came on and it wouldn't drive. Had to have it towed again. I stated I did not want this car. The dealership stated they talked to Chrysler and they would not do anything. On December 29, 2014, I was driving the engine and another light came on and the car hardly moved and would not go into reverse. The car is at the dealership and I am waiting to hear if Chrysler will now admit it is a lemon. The car appears to have problems every 2,000 to 2,500 each time. I am extremely disappointed and upset with Chrysler. I owned a Jeep Compass from 2011 to 2014 and had no problems.",0
"I bought my 2011 Jeep Liberty new which has just over 50,000 miles on it. I am a female in late 50's so no off road or rough driving. But already I had to replace a Idler pully belt and today a water pump. Not a happy camper.",0
"Do Not Buy a Jeep! I purchased a 2014 Jeep patriot about three months ago. There is a problem with the brakes. When you apply the brakes they squeal. The dealership told me that Jeep changed the composition of the brake pads to a less expensive material. This stuff makes terrible noise. It wakes up the neighborhood when I go to work in the morning. You can't take this Jeep to any place to go hunting. You can pull into or out of a parking lot without people noticing the poor quality of the vehicle. Most people believe that I am not maintaining the car. It has less than 10,000 miles on it. I took it in once and complained. They changed out one set of pads. Now the other side is making noise. Driving this vehicle is very embarrassing. I don't want the Jeep anymore. The old expression was that is a hulk of junk, now my expression is that is a hulk of jeep junk. Buy a Ford.",0
"2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit 53k - I owned other jeeps with a good experience but now that Fiat owns them and quality is in the toilet. Engine light on less than 3000 miles, won't start, computer problems, and that is just a few. It spent 3 months in shop of the 7 months I owned it. I filed for Lemon law and Chrysler bought the car back. It is a very good looking car but has no quality at all. Bought toyota 4 runner with 25k miles and not one issue. Stay away from Fix it again tony aka Fiat who owns Chrysler. Their products are worse than the junk from the 80s. Mercedes Benz lucked out dumping this company!!! Oh and let's not talk about the lack of any service at the dealerships either.....I spent 53k and treat you like crap. Go buy lexus toyota etc - now there is service. Hope they figure this out. I am sorry for all the other poor suckers buying this junk.",0
"Wrote a yr ago and it's worst. Transmission from 1st to 2nd gear skips and when it catches gear, rear end wants to fall off truck. Still having steering problem. It vibrates for 61 mph to 68 mph. So bad. The dealer and Chrysler have locked me out for any further attempts to have issue resolved. They will do that for you can't pursue lemon LAW. Navigation is always resetting on its own while driving. And at acceleration it won't move. It has about a 4 sec delay on take off. Almost got killed by trucks on highway when I try to shift lanes on take off. Please people do not buy Chrysler. I am saving you money and stress. Worst SUV I have ever experienced. Rather take the bus.",0
"I used to own a 2010 Jeep Patriot. I have driven Jeep for 21 years until today, 12/8/14. The vehicle in question was not paid off and not even five years old. Both ball joints went bad in the vehicle and had to be replaced. This is unacceptable for a vehicle this young. The first ball joint was fixed under warranty. The second ball joint went bad not even a full year later. I contacted Jeep about the issue and faxed them all of my paperwork from my mechanic. I was then strung along for over two months and finally got an answer that they would not reimburse me the part and labor for putting in the other ball joint. The customer service representative that handled my case I found to be condescending and aloof. 
      So for Jeep to save a couple of hundred dollars they are willing to let a customer go who was willing to stick with Jeep for life. I figure within my lifetime I would have bought at least five more vehicles from Jeep. Well no more. I have formally broken my relationship with the brand and went with a Japanese competitor. To anyone who reads this stay away from Jeep because they do not take care of loyal customers! I do not want to see any other families spend hard earned money on a product that breaks and is unreliable as the Jeep Patriot.",0

"So the lighting bolt light and esp light comes on pushing the gas pedal and seems the jeep is not getting any gas and it starts to shake really bad and idle like it's about to die...... I believe we have found the solution. We had the throttle body assemble replaced on Friday and as of Monday we have not had any problems. I did call the corporate office for jeep to verify that there was not a recall because apparently, according to my findings on the internet, this is an issue with jeeps. They told me there was not, but if I still have the same issue after having this repair done to call them back. Thankfully the jeep has been running great!! Hope this helps and solves the problem for anyone who is having the same issues.",1
"2007 jeep compass sport - A few weeks ago after hitting a bump, the lighting bolt light came on and the jeep starting shaking and sounding like it was about to die. When trying to press the gas, the jeep seemed like it wasn't getting any gas and would shake really bad. Even just sitting in drive or reverse, the idle sounded like it was about to die. We took the cables off the battery for about 5 mins, put them back on and the jeep ran fine for about 3 weeks. Today it did the same thing so we got some gas treatment and it kept doing the same thing. When we tried pressing the gas, the jeep would start shaking really bad and sound like it's about to die. After some thinking we decided to take the cables off the battery again for about 5 mins and sure enough we turned the jeep on. And sitting in drive and reverse, the idle was fine. And we drove around the parking lot and no lighting bolt light, no shaky idle and it seemed to run just fine. Not sure what magic happens when we take off the cables to the battery but it has worked twice for us so far. Good luck because I have researched for hours and I've found people with the same issue but no solution. I'm sure this is not a permanent solution but it is a temporary fix.",0
"2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit - On November 17th, after about 30 seconds driving forward, the car shifted from 2nd gear back to first gear. The car practically skidded to shift back to first. I was thrown forward in the car. Luckily, I wear my seat belt. It would not shift out of first after that. The engine light came on. I had it towed to the dealership where I bought it. They said something is wrong with the transmission. They said they could not fix the transmission, but would replace the entire transmission. They said with a car this new, they do not have the knowledge to fixing the transmissions. They replaced the transmission and drove it 200 miles. They said it is fixed. 
      I picked it up on a Monday, November 24 and drove it home. The next day, I had the problem again. When turning on 4 lane road (2 in one direction and two in another), the vehicle started to go across the intersection. It appeared to try to shift to 2nd, but the car stopped moving (like it was in neutral). I had to start blowing the horn as oncoming cars were coming at a high rate of speed. I could have killed. I immediately call the dealership. They picked the car up and drove it back to the dealership. They ran numerous tests on the car and could not duplicate the problem. They called and told me the car was ready.I have severe reservation about getting back in a vehicle that I could have been killed in and drive it away when I know, the dealership knows and Chrysler knows, they couldn't duplicate the problem and they didn't fix anything. So, basically, I will be driving a ticking time bomb that could blow up at any time. My wife, kids and grand-kids could be in jeopardy and other drivers on the road. I paid over 50K for this vehicle, only to find myself stressed out over this fact. I cannot get back into this vehicle knowing nothing was corrected and I was almost killed.",0
I purchased a 2014 Jeep Patriot new in July of 2014. In August I had to take it back in because the hood was lifting up and looked as if it were going to come off at freeway speeds. The windshield wiper smart switch also quit working. I was told that the hinges on the hood weren't very secure by design at the dealer but they replaced them anyway and it still wobbles going down the freeway and they replaced the smart switch. On November 21st I took it in again because there was a grinding noise coming from the front end. The dealer informed me that I had a defective transmission and they had to order one. On November 24th I took it back to have the new transmission put in and was told that it would be done on the 25th. When I called on the 25th they told me that the mechanic had stripped out the threads on a mounting bolt and had to put a heli-coil in it and it wouldn't be done until the 26th. I called on the 26th and they told me that one of the front drive axles was also defective and they had to order one. They were closed for Thanksgiving on the 27th so I called on the 28th and was told that the part was not in yet. It is now December 2nd and I still do not have a vehicle which I need to do my job so I have not been able to work for over a week!,0
"Car Continues to have problems after multiple repairs. Jeep has recall P41 (from Sept 3, 2014) that parts have not been made available for. 2006 Jeep Commander Issues: Sept 2013 -- Stalled, Shut Down, No Start. Piston Replaced Est. Cost ($1000) -- Repaired at Independent Auto Repair. Car stalled/shut down while driving approximately 25mph. Car restarted after about 5 tries and was driven “home”. No restart.

April 2014 -- Stalled, Shut Down, No Start -- Est. Cost $500 -- Repaired by Independent Mechanic. Starter Replaced/New Battery (approx. mileage 86,000).
      (My 66 yr old mother driving alone.) Car stalled while driving at approximately 25mph. After about 10 minutes and several attempts car restarted for a short distance (about 1 mile) and stalled again while driving. Car was towed “home”. Independent mechanic replaced battery and solenoid/starter. June 2014 -- No Start, “Transmission over Temp”-- Est. Cost $800 -- Repaired by Independent Mechanic. Jeep would start for very short period, over-heat and shut down. Would restart after cooling. “Transmission over Temp” light on dash. Hoses and water pump replaced. Blower motor replaced (a/c & heat hadn't worked in over a year). Replacing blower motor did allow a/c & heat to work BUT only on high.July 2014 -- Stalled, Shut Down, No Start (Towed In) Est. Cost $600 Approx. Mileage 92,000 - To Dealership. Dealership can’t find any problems. Had Tune-Up. Replaced spark plugs, etc. Vehicle was hesitating while driving. Engine light on. Dash lights would come on and shut completely off while driving. After car was shut off it wouldn't restart. Windows wouldn't work or if they finally engaged would go up and down sporadically. Car horn came on by itself and wouldn't shut off until relay was taken out. Windshield wipers went haywire. Jeep was TOWED to dealership because it wouldn't start… Therefore, it wouldn't run, but the dealership couldn't find anything wrong with it. Tune-up was done and the Jeep, somehow, ran.Sept 2014 -- Stalled, Shut Down, No Start (Towed In) Est Cost $600 Approx. Mileage 94,000 - To Dealership. Starter Replaced, New Battery. Car started hesitating while driving. Dash lights would all come on and then all shut off. When coming to a stop or slowing down car would lose power. At stops, would have to keep foot on gas to keep car from stalling. While coming to an intersection to make a left turn on a green turn arrow car wouldn’t engage to excel. My 7 year old daughter was in the car. I feared we were going to stall in the middle of the intersection of a busy street. All the dash lights came on and shut off repeatedly as we coasted around the turn. Car re-engaged and we pulled into a parking lot. Shut the car off. Went into Walmart. When we came out car started. Engine light on. Being only 1 mile from home we drove home. The next morning car wouldn't start. Got a new battery. Car still wouldn't start. Had it towed to dealership. Dealership replaced solenoid/starter.Sept 2014 -- Hesitates, Lights on dash on and off, Engine light on, problems starting. Drove to Dealership. Dealership can’t find any problems. Again, dashboard lights came and all shut off. Jeep is/was hesitating while driving and not engaging/changing gears while driving. Also, periodically accelerates randomly while driving. Dealership suggests replacing control module ($1300) and having wiring harness diagnosed ($600 for diagnosis not to fix it -- est. cost to replace wiring harness $1500 to $3000). But, they do NOT know what is wrong with the Jeep.Oct. 2014 -- Hesitates, Random Acceleration, Dash lights all on to all off. -- No Fix. Vehicle continues to have problems. As I cannot afford to keep replacing parts or diagnosing issues I drive it as it. I have 3 children that I will not drive in the Jeep any further away from home than a mile or 2… and will only drive with the children in the car on side streets or back roads. Therefore, my children do not go anywhere except the local park, to school, or to a friend’s house that lives nearby. They do not go to any store with me that is farther than 1 mile away, or that main roads have to be taken to get to it.

Chrysler issued recall P41 (Faulty Ignition) on Sept. 3 2014 but parts are not made to fix the problem YET. 2 Months from issued recall ""we"" are still waiting for Chrysler to make and distribute parts. Chrysler issued recall on Sept 21 (maybe 23) for recall of TIPM but only for SOME of the vehicles affected. 11/21/2014 Jeep lost power at 35mph. Re-engaged. 11/25/2014 Jeep lost power at 25mph. Re-engaged. 11/26/2014 Jeep lost power at 35mph. Re-engaged. Called Chrysler and was told there is nothing they can do about recall parts as the parts are not ready. There is no sense continuing to take the vehicle to be serviced as the problem does not seem to be able to be diagnosed properly. It does not seem to be able to be fixed.",0
"My lumbar support periodically gives me and other drivers a ""rabbit chop"" to the left kidney while driving down the road. Periodically, when you adjust the electronic lumbar support on the driver's, it will ""pop"" and thump you in the lower back. 
      Too bad, even though this has happened to multiple drivers during the 6,000 miles I've owned the vehicle for, since the dealer can't duplicate the problem, my experience doesn't count. If this was a ""rattle"" that I was hearing, or a ""shake"" that I was feeling, I'd understand the need for an ability to duplicate the problem requirement to fix. But a kick to the back? That's not opinion, that's fact. If I kill myself in this car one day, check the seat. Chances will be good that this was the real cause of the accident!",0

"The trim around the windshield of my Patriot does not lay flat. It looks like it should be tucked into the groove at the tops of the windshield on both sides. It sticks up and causes a whistling sound. I have had the service department look at it and was told that ""they're all like that"". I have contacted Chrysler Customer Service and also was told that there is nothing they can do because it is not a design flaw because they are all like that. Also the trim along the roof on the passenger side was warped. When they tried to replace it, they discovered that the body under the trim was all jagged so I had to take it to a bodyshop to have that repaired. My salesman admitted that the trim is ""wrong"" and offered to ""glue it down"".",0

"Transmission keeps shifting into neutral. Check engine light goes on. I have to pull over and restart to get the Jeep to have power again. There is something wrong with the Trans, shifts very hard not smooth at all. Who designed this piece? Did damage to the rear end and I think it was the trans shifting so hard that it broke things in the diff. They had to rip it all apart but did comp the rear end. The dealership said everything was fixed. I had to pay for the trans to be serviced 20K miles early and pay for the car rental. 
      I feel like they should have comped everything, their parts are failing. Then parts (Flood Lights) were stolen off my Jeep while getting serviced, what Next? The next day after getting the vehicle back the Check engine light came back on and the car shifted into neutral while on the freeway. This has been happening since about 35K miles, now at 40K. This is a dangerous situation and someone is going to die driving these vehicles with these trans shifting out of gear. Very sad for their top of the line jeeps loaded. I love the look of these vehicles but the auto transmission sucks! I wish I would have bought a manual. Please Recall the Trans before you hurt someone!",0

The local Jeep dealership has carried out various works to a total cost of nearly 1000 euros, but cannot cure problem. They are now suggesting further work of around 10000 euros but are not sure if this will solve the problem or not. Jeep seem to have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it.

"A number of times, the transmission felt as if a clutch was slipping. This happened first thing in the morning a number of times. The dealer changed something he called the valve. A week later - the same thing happened while climbing Mt. Washington, NH. I had to do a dangerous U-turn and had no engine braking all the way down. After an hour, the problem cleared. The dealer actually told me that there is no engine braking on this car... Chrysler said that if the dealer doesn't find the problem then they will give me the car back. Basically - they are calling me a liar. KEEP AWAY FROM CHRYSLER!!!",0

I bought a New Jeep Grand Latitude and at 295 miles two weeks to the day after I brought It home the transmission went. The Jeep Service said that it needs to have the transmission replaced. Chrysler will pay with the warranty but I was told this repair will greatly reduce the trade in value of the vehicle. I haven't even made the first payment yet! I don't want that Jeep. I will take a new one or nothing. Chrysler so far said no. How do I get outta this?! I don't want a Jeep that's value has been reduced through no fault of my own. The vehicle has other issues that I reported the day after I bought it. Service at Bedard's said can't be anything wrong because it's new.,0
"Bought a brand new Jeep Overland and the brakes went out on the highway, almost cost me my life shortly after Chrysler recalled the brake booster. All four 20 inch rims also started to pit but Chrysler would not replace. All in all it is a very sharp looking vehicle inside and out but that's all you get as Chrysler does not stand behind their product. There are number of other things that have also gone wrong with the SUV but I won't get into detail. You have been warned. Stay away from this company if you can!",0
"The seat cracks constantly, yet intermittently, in the lumbar area. After replacing the same part 3 times I contacted Jeep customer assist. They proved to be 100% worthless, calling constantly and repeating only the information I had originally given three months prior. I asked for some research to be done, knowing that others on line had similar issues. After writing to the corporate office I finally got someone to listen. Chrysler paid for me to have a third party modify the seat back mechanism. The problem is that the part is too short and in a certain area it slides off the plastic and causes the cracking sound. It can be fixed and they will pay, but you must be tenacious.",0

"I have a 2008 Jeep Patriot. Two years ago the transmission fluid light came on and immediately my speed went to around 20 mph. This was in a freeway construction zone. We could not get off the road and limped along at 20 mph until we could get into a parking lot. How we survived that I don't know. Traffic was zooming around us in restricted lanes. It was taken to a nearby dealer who could not look at it until the next day. And then they could not find it. They would not even drive it.
      Back at home I took it to a local dealer and after 6-7 weeks of them having my car, Chrysler agreed to a new transmission. One year later when it was hot, it did it again. I find in cold weather season this is not so bad but when temps hit 80 I cannot drive faster than 55 or the transmission fluid overheating light comes on. Today July 27 2014 temps was 102 and my 92-year-old mom and I sat in the boiling heat on the side of a highway because it happened again. Not just once today. TWICE today.If someone wants to have a class action suit, let me know. Because Jeep maintains there is no problem. I will never own another.",0
"Bought new 2014 Jeep Patriot. This vehicle was operated according to break in options in Jeep manual. The check engine light came on at 800 mi. Jeep was taken to dealer and light turned off. Mechanic stated that there was a BULLETIN? I left with the Jeep. Again at approx. 1500 mi. check engine light came on. Jeep was taken to dealer and light was turned off. The explanation was they had no idea what was causing the problem. A Chrysler REP he said? was at the dealer and told me the engineers were working on the problem? I told them I bought the new car for peace of mind not for worse problems than I had. The REP told me to drive it and don't worry.

I asked the Jeep customer service for help and was blown off after several contacts. I was told that ""We fix problems, not help people buy new cars."" The personnel at Jeep lied to me several times and played games with my complaint. I was referred to three different case mgrs. All I asked was for help with Tax and registration fees that I had paid twice in less than a month. I intend to somehow find a contact for someone in management.

They indicated there was no noise. The noise is worse and I went to a new service department and they indicated there is a piece that is missing in the seat belt. Since it is not there, the item is not covered. Really!!! Did you ever think that maybe it wasn't there from day one?? Of course if the piece was there, it is cover but since the piece is missing they will not cover. Nice job, Chrysler.",0

"Bought a 2014 Jeep Patriot on March 21, 2014. I loved it. Less than 3 months later, it starts missing and stalling with baby in the car. I rushed it straight to the dealer. They said there was an issue with the computer and the new one should be in the next day. I never heard from them. On the 3rd day I called, lady told me they had found a valve that was sticking and it would be there the next day. I had to work the weekend so I called that Monday. They said the computer was replaced but wasn't talking to the car so they had a specialist coming from Chrysler to see if they could fix it and he gave the number for us to get an advocate from Chrysler. 
      We felt like this should not be happening with a new car with less than 5,000 miles on it. Told them we feel we got a lemon and want a replacement. Nothing extra just the exact same car or a warranty that covers the issue for the time we have the car. We are at week 3 and they still can't fix the car. The guy at the dealership said he had emailed people due to their inability to fix it. It's just sitting out back and I am stuck in a loaner half its size with bald tires that sucks the gas. Chrysler's response: I have to continue paying on it. They will not replace it or any other compensation. And if I want a rental that is comparable to what I had, they will pay $25 a day but that is all because Enterprise does not carry their products.",0

"2014 Jeep Cherokee latitude Lemon - Problems since January. Newest problem needs cylinder head and was overheating. Not including the tranny wobble out of 1st and 2nd gear if it even moves. I feel very unsafe driving it and opened a ticket with corporate. Contacting lawyer, they had my jeep for over 1 week, no loaner. I have called them 2 times. Shouldn't they call me and get authorization to work on my car??? Super upset because it did drive well in the snow!
      Updated on 02/22/2015I had to get a lawyer. There is a laundry list of things that went wrong with my 2014 Jeep Cherokee. First, the second day I had it the check engine light came on. The dealership said it was the oxygen sensor, but it wasn't bad enough to change. That happened 3 times before they decided to change it. When the light came on I would get horrible gas mileage, but that's apparently not an issue to Jeep. The remote start doesn't work when the check engine light comes on which makes sense, but when you have to wait 2 weeks for a service visit in the dead of winter, not cool. Next the touch screen failed and they had to order it. Couldn't drive it heat in winter with my kids. The manual controls won't work if the touch screen malfunctions. Then after the first week the transmission was constantly acting funny, hesitating, and the mechanic would go on a test drive with us and couldn't deny our complaints. Then the head went on the engine, it overheated. It took over 40 days to diagnose. They gave a hard time about a free loaner car. I forgot to mention they keep greasing the suspension because it makes a grinding noise since about 400 miles. The transmission is still horrible, the updates seem to be made up. I tried trading it in and Bayside Jeep in Queens would not return my calls for a trade. A hand full of time the jeep wouldn't start, would appear to be dead, then 20 min later it would start. Unsafe in stop and go traffic, because it lunges forward and won't continue. I hear a loud clunk when that happens. The transmission or engine makes a weird gurgling noise. I got a lawyer because I was unhappy having a new jeep with replacement parts in the engine. It's a huge deal, I should have gotten a new one. The lawyer got them to buy my jeep back at full sales price, but I'm still losing rebates which = losing my trade in. I also had to pay for millage because of NYS Lemon Law. I don't have good credit so when I turn it in I will get back about 500.00 to start over. It takes another 6-7 months for NYS to refund tax/title/DMV fees. So I don't feel whole, and I have no idea what to get. Before this I a bmw, but it was rear wheel drive, and before that the had a 95 cheep grand cherokee that was great and still on the road. They don't make cars like they used to. I'm at a loss for what to purchase next, I've been burned by this experience.",0

"2014 Jeep Compass in the service department constantly for stall starting and engine ticking noise when turning it off. Chrysler states that they are unable to detect the stall starting. I have 3 videos to prove it and they're stressing me out. My Jeep has gone to the dealer over 4 times for the same issue and the only thing that was replaced was a solenoid for the ticking noise when shutting off that is still there. All I'm hearing is if it happens again. I live nearly 100 miles from the dealership one way. 
      The dealership and Chrysler representative lied like they put a black box on my Jeep to detect the issue and asked me to bring my Jeep back to the dealership by a certain date to have it removed. I get to the dealership just to find out no box was ever placed on it. I'm fed up and stressed to the max with the run-arounds and in the midst of all this from the beginning, dealing with a dying mother that passed January 25 and still mourning her, and dealing with Chrysler is too much.",0

"I bought a used 2007 Jeep Compass from a private party and a few moths later with only 47000 miles the transmission started making a whining noise. I brought it to a Dodge Chrysler dealer and they told me it needed a new transmission at a cost of $3840. I complained to the dealer and spoke with Chrysler customer service and they wouldn't help out with the cost. A transmission shouldn't fail in only 47,000 miles.

The compressor lasted the rest of the summer, but this year it has stopped functioning again. I cannot afford to replace the compressor each year!

I was told that Chrysler has a problem doing repairs until all parts are tested and then will fix needed parts as Chrysler feels necessary. It has been over a week for parts to be sent to dealership. I am patiently waiting to hear from dealership. I paid over $46000 list price for vehicle and Chrysler is in no hurry to repair plus no vehicle was given to me to use during this period. Chrysler is not responsible for your transportation during repair and the dealership did provide me with a vehicle.

"Daughter was in an accident where she said that she gave the Liberty a little gas and it jumped forward. She rear ended a Saturn. She hadn't driven the vehicle much since she was only 16 at the time and I put it off as inexperience. We had a gas cap error appear on the information center and after 2 trips to the dealership, they found out that a hose had a hole worn into it by the wiring loom. I sealed the hole temporarily and cleared the error code. I noticed that when I revved the engine and held at a constant RPM of 2000, it would rev to 3000 RPM and fall to 1000 RPM without any fluctuation of pressure on the gas pedal. When I revved it to 2000 RPM, again it went back up to 3000 and I removed my foot... it did not quit revving. I turned the Liberty off and took the seal off the hose. Same revving pattern. Took to Landers McLarty in Bessemer and the service manager is now aware of the issue. STAR(?) ticket is to be opened with Chrysler.",0

"I have a 2006 Liberty Limited which I factory ordered fully loaded and have had continual problems with the power windows. In the first 2 months my driver's door window would not go up straight. I went to the dealership and had it repaired. Within a month it happened again. I had it repaired again. The entire mechanism was replaced and again it did the same thing. In the first 13 months I only put on 4700 kms so as you can see I never drove it much.
      At this time we moved from Ontario to Alberta and a wonderful dealership in Alberta repaired it but I found out at this time that Chrysler came up with some new mechanism system to run the window. The old systems never quit or had these problems but Chrysler had to reinvent the wheel. Over time I have had to get the driver side window repaired 5 times. Then all of a sudden one day the passenger side window just fell down. Had to have it repaired. Then I received a letter from Chrysler that they were extending the warranty on all window repairs to 7 years. Should tell you that there is a real problem if they have to extend the warranty. I also paid for extended warranty and that was a waste of money.Then all of a sudden one New Year's Eve the passenger side rear window fell down. Again went to a dealership and they did get warranty on it. Now the extended warranty was up on June 15, 2013. On July 1st 2013 the driver side rear window fell down and would not operate. This was the only window that hadn't been repaired yet. I went to a Chrysler dealership that I had never been to and they were refused warranty by Chrysler Canada. Now this dealership (Southtown Chrysler - Edmonton) who I never bought the vehicle from or ever been there before was so nice to me that they offered to not charge me labor if I paid for the part. This was fantastic service from the dealership and Chrysler doesn't deserve to have this quality of dealership. The dealership cared but Chrysler didn't.Now why should the dealership be out for Chrysler's poor design. I have since at least done other repair business with them but I will never give Chrysler business again. I contacted Chrysler 2 times about this issue. The first time they responded by telling me tough luck as the warranty was up. I could see if it was a year after but this happened 2 weeks after the warranty was up. I hardly use this vehicle and if had have happened 15 days earlier they would have repaired it. I sent them another email in response to their answer and in 4 months they haven't even had the courtesy to respond. I have decided to file this complaint so other people will know about their poor customer care.I hope other people listen and don't waste your money on their products or any of their extended warranty products as they also have a pile of loopholes and aren't worth the money.",0

Within the first month after purchase, a mechanism within the front driver's side door broke causing the window to slip inside the door and become unusable. The dealership repaired the part free of charge as the vehicle was ""new to me"". In 2012, the same mechanism broke again. This time, I was told by the dealership that this is a common problem but I was forced to pay for the repair as Jeep has not yet recalled the mechanism.
      Yesterday, December 21, 2013, the mechanism broke again this time inside the passenger's front side door. I have called the dealership to schedule the repair but currently my window is being held up with duct tape. I do not think I should have to pay for the repair as this is an ongoing issue and obviously the cause of a defective part. Jeep should recall the component and/or develop a mechanism that does not break so easily. I have already filed a complaint with the NHTSA and Jeep headquarters.",0
"I bought my 2010 Jeep Liberty the later part of October 2013. I was extremely happy. It drove great. I loved the looks. It was very roomy, and comfortable. The beginning of December 2013 the alarm system will go off for no reason. The dome lights will come on for no reason, then go out. And a couple of days ago the engine started acting like it's going to die, then it's reeves back up. Today December 13, 2013, I was taking my daughter to school. I approached a traffic light that was red and cars were stopped. I began breaking, slowing down. When I was about 50 feet from the stopped car in front of me the engine reeved up like I had stomped the gas. It lunged forward causing me to rear end the car in front of me. My daughter will be 16, and was sitting in the passenger seat. Upon impact she lunged forwards striking her forehead on the dash board. My lower back is killing me. The woman I hit was not injured. Was wondering if this has happened to other owners? And if there was a defect in the jeep?",0
"I purchased a 2012 Jeep Patriot. It drove fine for the first 7,000 miles. From then on, I heard crunching and grinding whenever I would go over smallest bumps and speed bumps. Then, I brought it to the dealer. It was my struts and control arm. I do all highway mileage. At 11k, I feel a shake and wobble in front end. I brought it to dealer at least 10 times and complain to Chrysler that the dealer says they acknowledge an issue but can't figure it out. I am angry. I have a huge blowout on highway with my two young babies. I did not even hit anything and this is at 21k. They open a ""star case"" on it and some technician says it's my axles. They are blown. 
      I spent $400 on new tires and several trips to dealer wasting my time, and drove it 11k+ before they fixed it. It was fine for maybe a month plus, but now I hear grinding and clanking, also something loose. Plus the set button does not work sometimes on steering column. Very sluggish pick up during acceleration, hesitates when accelerating. I had to have power steering pump and serpentine pulley replaced at 20k. I HATE THIS JEEP and biggest mistake in my life. Now I am out of warranty slightly and I have to pay for it. I will NEVER buy anything American made vehicle again. Poorly made and very cheap. Worst choice I could have made buying a BRAND NEW VEHICLE.",0
"I have a 2007 Jeep Commander that loses power, no matter how much you push gas car will not go, then after a few minutes car regains power, and it seems to happen every few months.",0
"Wife liked the looks of this jeep so I bought it for her. First Chrysler product and last I buy. I never thought I had to inspect inch by inch before leaving dealership. Both front seat backings were damaged or with defects. Dealer simply says, it is under warranty. Okay, no problem. While driving back home to other Elko, Nevada, wife notices passenger visor mirror is shattered. Dealer says it is under warranty. One week later, wife experiences all warning lights on cluster flashing and speedometer blacked out and inoperable! We call dealer extremely upset and they say it is a recall that they just forgot to tell us! But it's under warranty...not one apology! I could not convince wife into purchasing another foreign vehicle then but after this experience, Chrysler products will not even be considered! Thank you.",0
"I own a 2007 Jeep Commander Limited 2WD, 5.7 Liter Hemi. The vehicle will lose power at unexpected times and this has happened on multiple occasions and at various speeds. The vehicle will lose power and buck forward as if it has been rear ended by another vehicle, but the engine will resume without having to be restarted by the ignition. However, during the hesitation, you can not accelerate, all power is lost. The vehicle is still under warranty and I have experienced this problem from 42,000 miles to 79,000 miles which is the current mileage. 
      It seems to happen every 3 months, putting mine and my family's life at risk. The dealership stated they can not fix the problem since the check engine light is not on, it doesn't throw a code, and they can not get the problem to duplicate on their test drive. There needs to be a safety recall on this dangerous situation before someone is hurt or killed!! I have contacted Consumer Affairs by email and encourage other Commander owners to do the same if you are experiencing this problem. www.consumeraffairs.com",0
"Hello, our beautiful Jeep Liberty with 57,500 miles has a broken spring loaded draw curtain to cover the luggage area. It has completely quit retracting and seems to be coming apart. I am the only person to handle this and I'm not rough on it. I need it working to keep my golf clubs out of sight and now cannot do it. The great dealer here in Slidell, La says they can fix it for $250.00 (with a new unit)!!! I want information on how to take it apart and fix it and cannot get a answer from the Jeep co.",0
"At least 10 years have gone by with continual complaints about a well known, costly repair for failure of blend doors in heating and cooling blower and failing window motors. At what point does JEEP repair this problem. The piece of equipment used is junk and this is well known and has not been resolved in way too many years. For a part that couldn't cost more than $10 to add to these areas to resolve the problem, this is very sad that they would not fix this and add cost of part to price of car instead of owners having to replace this part that has been known for failure and costing on average $700-$1200 to pull dash to fix blend doors and window motors are min of $50 with you fixing yourself, times the number of them that fail, and all will eventually on power windows. The pieces of cheap plastic used in these areas should be a liability for the manufacturer and they should have been forced to recall these vehicles for this constant repeat, year after year manufacturing of a defective part not intentioned to last.",0
"First of all, I want to say that up until this last purchase, I have been a loyal Chrysler customer since the 60's and have purchased about 10 of their vehicles including this 2011 Jeep. My wife and I traded our 2001 Durango 4x4 for the Jeep to be able to continue occasionally exploring back country areas in the Carolinas and Tennessee with the option of a removable soft top. Everybody knows that Jeeps are supposed to be ""Trail Rated"", yet they sell a vehicle that if used off road (just gravel roads) that it will burn up the transmission due to excessive fluid heat. If we did extreme off-roading (mud bogging or rock climbing) like you see Jeeps doing on TV, I might accept having to install additional equipment. 
      I'm told by Jeep Customer Service that if I want to use my vehicle this way, I have to pay for installation of an additional transmission cooler. Why didn't the ""Engineers"" incorporate that into the vehicle in the first place? I understand they reconfigured the standard cooler into the A/C condenser vs. the Radiator. Did they ""Trail Test it""? Are they willing to lose loyal customers over a couple hundred dollar part? They do install the factory cooler if you get the tow package, but I didn't plan to tow anything with my Jeep so it didn't concern me that the one I bought wasn't equipped with this package. Since I've dealt with this particular dealership for over 20 years, I've called and asked for the owner to respond by phone to see if he is more honorable than Chrysler.",0
I bought the Jeep in 2012 and it has been back to dealership more than 17 times. I have tried and DID everything I could. I can't enjoy my Jeep at all.,0
"Steering vibrating - Well 3 times at dealer service. Their answer is “We do not know what it is, sorry.” Bottom line I started LEMON LAW proceedings.",0
I brought my Jeep Liberty in for an alignment due to excessive tire wear only to find out both ball joints are shot and about to come apart. Called about the recall and was told mine did not fall into the recall.... REALLY!!!!!! Mine was mfr in June 2006 and the recall was for all before March 2006. Jeep has a history of using inferior parts then won't stand behind it.,0
"I bought my 2013 Jeep Patriot about 5 months ago. I loved it up until about 10K miles when I first started having problems. It has the CVT style transmission in it, and has now overheated and left me on the side of the road 4 times now. This latest time I sat on the side of the road for 21/2 hours in a remote area where I had no cell service. I have determined that it happens just about every time the temp is over 90 degrees outside - happens frequently in southern Louisiana and I have sustained between 70-75 miles an hour for more than 1 hour - I commute 1-1/2 hours each way as I live in Mississippi, and the majority of the highway speeds between here and there are 70 mph. I have been fighting with Chrysler for almost 2 months now. I was ecstatic when I got a call from corporate last Friday telling me they would be happy to buy back OR trade-in my vehicle. Now the corporate guy here is telling me they absolutely will not buy-back my vehicle, they will only trade. I have been unable to find another Chrysler vehicle in my price range that suits my needs since it must be MSRP to MSRP. I am still actively fighting, and considering getting a lawyer at this point.",0
"This vehicle has a Mercedes 6-speed manual transmission, which you would assume would be an excellent transmission. It completely failed with slightly over 60,000 miles on it. No one will rebuild it due to the cost of tools and parts, so a new transmission from Jeep is the only solution. Chrysler basically told me to go away, as they had no intention of helping me with the problem. Whatever happened to that legendary Jeep that was bomb-proof and ran forever? This vehicle is ""trail rated"" - think I want to take this piece of junk on a back road in the Colorado mountains? Chrysler has no pride in its vehicles. Any wonder why they went into bankruptcy?",0
"I bought my 2004 Jeep Liberty almost 2 years ago. Aside from the constant light show on the dash, I loved the car! I started losing power when accelerating, at first occasionally but becoming more frequent over a month. I took it to my regular mechanic a couple of times but they couldn't find the problem. I ended up losing power completely and had it towed to Jeep dealership. First, I was told the water pump was loose and ""shook things up"". I needed a new one. They also did an ""injector service""(?). Tech drove it thinking it was fixed but he suddenly realized the car was a hazard when it all but stopped on the highway. 
      We are now @ $800 and climbing! A few hours later, he discovers a problem with a cylinder head. Here's the catch. They told me it was cracked and needed replaced but told my extended warranty co. it was warped. So when talking to warranty co., they would say warped but dealership would say cracked when talking to them! Who do I believe, the warranty co. or the supposedly trained tech that knows these things? Of course I believe the tech and tell them it needs done whether the warranty covers it or not. Aside from the fact that the service manager lied to me several times stating he was on the phone constantly with warranty co., he lied when telling me it was cracked! Warranty won't pay stating it was not a necessary replacement! It WAS warped and could have been machined down at a much lower cost! So after my Liberty being at dealership for 3 weeks (which I still can't figure out), I get to pick it up tomorrow! At last count, the total was almost $3400! That doesn't include the rental I needed! Always had VWs, then went to Subarus. With my business, I need 4 WD, though, which is why I went to Jeep. Never again! Can't trust the company and can't count on the cars!",0
I bought a 2007 Jeep Compass a little over a year ago. Having problems with the CVT transmission. Any other Compass owners having any problems with transmission overheating and high RPMs but cannot pick up speed?,0
"I bought my Jeep Patriot new off the lot. In fact I bought one that wasn't even on the lot. They had to ship it in from up country. I fell in love with the look and feel of it as soon I saw it. I've put 90,000 km. on it which is a little more than normal and I haven't had one bad experience with it yet. As long as you don't count going to the dealership for maintenance. But I solved that too. I just do it myself now. I obviously can't do everything myself but I do the majority. I've always wanted a Jeep, but could never afford the $35k price tag. That is until they made the Patriot. It's still the same old Jeep style and attitude but with a little more road etiquette behind it. I know I wouldn't be taking it rock crawling, but since I've modified to its max, I can go just about anywhere. Through rivers, anywhere you take your F-150, Nissan Xterra, Dodge Tacoma, I'll be right there beside you. I'm 110% satisfied with my Jeep, and I wouldn't trade it now for anything.",1
"I purchase this 2009 Jeep a year and half ago. I have had nothing but problems with it. I had to replace the brakes when the dealer claims they were just replaced and can't forget the rotors, struts in the front, alternator. I went to Virginia on vacation and 50 miles outside of Richmond, I had no power in the Jeep. The Jeep was still running but when you push on the gas, nothing happens. We stood on the side of the road for an hour to let the Jeep cool down and the Jeep started up with no problem. I was going to the Cape and the Jeep stalled again. No lights came on. When we turn on the A/C, the Jeep stopped moving and we had no power at all. I took the Jeep back to Harr Ford and they claim that they couldn't find anything wrong and there wasn't anything wrong with the Jeep. I ask them,then, ""Why does this Jeep keep losing power?"" No one had an answer.To Be Continued... going to another garage.",0
"I purchased a 2006 Jeep Liberty for my daughter going to college in May 2007. Within a week of ownership the driver's side window just dropped. We brought the jeep back for repair and were told that the regulators were faulty. To make a long story short three subsequent windows have had the same problem multiple times. This has been an ongoing and constant problem. Since our daughter was at college far away we had to make the decision to have 3 of the windows permanently shut because even when Jeep did fix the windows they just broke again shortly after. 
      We have kept the Jeep in mint condition however now the 4th window has fallen...Chrysler/Jeep support basically told me that this is not a safety issue so there is no recall. They told me I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED EXTENDED WARRANTY. OK FOR A PROBLEM THEY CREATED. Never will I buy a Jeep or Chrysler car again. As a matter of fact I will no longer buy an American made car again.",0
I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty and about a year and a half ago my window came crashing down suddenly. After taking it to the dealer I found out that the motor was broken and the window regulator was cracked which I was told holds the window in place. Just last month the same window I had replaced came crashing down again. I had the regulator replaced again. Now today the other rear window has come crashing down. I have filed a complaint on the safety of the windows and I believe a recall should be made. These parts are $300 each and every time they need to be replaced. I believe everyone who is having the same issue should be making a claim.,0
"When I purchased my commander I started having problems with it the next day and it was one thing after another. When I was driving down the highway all the lights on the dashboard were flashing on and off and stalling. Took it to dealer. They replaced the wiring harness, didn't fix it. Took it there again for the same problem. This time I had 10 top Jeep techs take the whole inside of my Jeep out to expose the wires. They went wire by wire and there is a control module in the driver's side door and once they replaced that it never happened again. Now I have only had this Jeep for 2 years and I have had the transmission replaced, wiring harness, front control module, power steering pump, ignition switch, front differential, and I cant keep brakes or rotors on it to save the life of me. The problem with all of the Jeeps is everything is computerized and the computers they put in them are CRAP. I will never ever buy another Jeep again.",0
"We have a 2007 Jeep Commander with the lifetime, unlimited mile, unlimited time warranty from Jeep (Chrysler). For the past year, it has stalled repeatedly without warning. It just dies while going down the road which of course results in a loss of all power assist for steering and braking leaving the driver to muscle it out of traffic. It will restart but only after putting it in Park and turning the key completely to the off position and then restarting. It has been to the dealership multiple times, for a total time in the shop for a total time of about two months during the past year and they have yet to diagnose, much less, fix the problem despite getting Jeep engineers involved. We got the run-around from Jeep who eventually dropped the case and said we could start over with a new complaint. What value is a lifetime warranty on a vehicle that the dealer and manufacturer is incapable of repairing? The dealership has done what they can, but Jeep offers us NOTHING but words.",0
"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Patriot in August 2011. I like my Jeep, but the problem I am encountering with the CVT Transmission is frustrating and concerning. In less than a year of having my Jeep, I began to notice a whining noise and the RPM getting stuck as if the transmission was not shifting. When I took it into my dealer’s service department, they said they couldn't find anything wrong. The assistant service manager suggested it was the wind I was hearing. A couple of months later, the same issues were happening regularly, but now the transmission temperature warning light came on. I again took it to the dealership. This time, I was again told they checked it out, couldn't find anything wrong, and they said they couldn't diagnose it unless the light was on.
      The next time the issue occurred, I was traveling to visit my parents 45 minutes away. The temperature warning light came on about 40 minutes into the drive. Once I got to my parents house, I decided to take it to the Jeep Dealership there. Unfortunately, when I started the Jeep, the light was off, making the trip to the out of town dealership pointless. In the last two months, the same issues have occurred, but on two occasions, my Jeep went into LIM (limp in mode), which forcibly slowed the vehicle down and required me to pull over on the Interstate for the transmission to cool down. After the first time it went into LIM, I called Jeep Customer Service to see what suggestions they had. The customer service representative with Jeep was nice, advised they had never heard of this problem, and instructed me to follow up the dealership.Before making yet another appointment with the dealership, I decided to do some general research on CVT Transmission in Jeep. I was totally surprised to see consumer comments of the exact same issues, especially after the Jeep representative said Jeep hadn't heard of this problem. One of these reviews suggested recording the issue. Within a week, it happened again! This time I recorded the noise, the temperature warning light coming on, and having to pull over. I took the video to the dealership. This time, the same assistant manager said, ""Every Jeep with CVT Transmission has that issue.""I asked about switching out the transmission. He advised there isn't a way to convert the transmission. He also said Jeep hasn't released a fix yet. So, my not even two year old Jeep, which is still under the manufacturer warranty, is defective with no fix for the issue. In the mean time, I can't drive my Jeep out of town and feel unsafe driving it. To top it all off, the CVT Transmission was a $1,000 upgrade! I feel like I have no options, but to retain an attorney and file a complaint under my state’s lemon law and the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act.",0
"I own a 2005 Jeep Liberty Sport. I have had to replace window regulators at least 5 times. Usually the dealership took care of it but I had to pay for a few. And now, in 2013, the last one replaced has broken again. But this one was already replaced by what I was told was the improved window regulator. But just like the old ones, it had about a 2-year life span. But the dealership only gives out a 1-year warranty. Just for this reason, I do not recommend a Jeep Liberty unless the window regulators have been upgraded from the cheapest plastic to metal.",0
"Problems with new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee - The transmission clunks really bad at slow speeds and is very jerky on downshifts. The dealer justified the problem but Jeep denies anything is wrong. This vehicle has only 500 miles on it? Also, the navigation screen has just gone blank on several occasions but of course won't do it when at the dealer for service. The dealer is very cooperative but Jeep is not. Really making me question my first ever Jeep purchase?",0
"My husband bought me the 2004 Jeep Wrangler Sahara brand new. I have been driving it, plowing with it, towed other cars with it and pulled people out of snow banks with it. I have never had a problem with it. Some of the complaints I see on here are just plain stupidity. Read your owner's manual before you drive it. Learn what 4x4 high and low are used for before you just engage it and drive down the road. For the one legitimate jeep complaint I saw (water leaks), go on Jeepforum.com and some super nice people will tell you many different ways to fix it, some with videos.",1
"Jeep Grand Cherokee 2001 - I have been waiting for several years to be contacted by Chrysler regarding the potential problem with the rear gas tank exposure, as the gas tank blows up when you are rear ended by another vehicle. Many deaths have occurred and we are still waiting for the safety issue to be resolved! Please let us know any status of the rear end gas tank issue. Many thanks.",0
"I needed a RHD Jeep. I went to TN to get one asap. I had 2 to choose from that were new. Since they had black interior, I wanted the one with the tinted windows. I did not like the large mud tires on it and said so about 5 times. He did not want to change the tires; he said he would have to spend $300 to recalibrate them to 16"" tires. So, I paid more for the ""better"" tires as he stated. I found out that the tires slung rocks onto all 4 hinges and beat the paint off. They sold me $10 touch up paint with $6 shipping and handling. I bought mud flaps. This stopped the 2 top hinges from much more damage.
      Now I have ordered Mopar running boards in hopes of stopping more damage to the lower hinges before I touch up the paint. It costs $315. They offered to sell me one for $615 with installation. I hope my husband can install them. I feel this is a design flaw. I told both Jeep Corp. and the salesman that. Neither of them agreed. Now I have noticed that when I drive by the mile markers on the interstate, 3 miles measures 2.7, 4 miles measures 3.6 on the Jeep, and 5 miles measures 4.5, so I estimate if I go 10 miles only 9 miles will show up on the Jeep.",0
"I purchased a 2011 Jeep Patriot new in August 2011. At 4000 miles, I pulled out of a parking lot and my Jeep would not go faster than 1-2 miles per hour. The RPM's when pushing down the accelerator to the floor would go past 6 and into the red, but the vehicle would not go. It sounded like the vehicle was in neutral with the gas pedal all the way to the floor. I turned it off and on several times and it was fine. I took the vehicle to the dealership and they couldn’t find anything wrong with it and nothing showed up when they hooked it to their computer. This same problem has happened 7 times from April 2012 to April 22, 2013.
      The last time I took it to the dealership on April 22, 2013, their technician at the plant diagnosed the problem that the floor mat must be in the way of the gas pedal and that the engine is not getting fuel. Seriously? If the RPM's are at 6 or higher... then the engine is getting fuel. I am sick to death of this problem and no help from the dealership. It’s ridiculous and pathetic! Dealership is telling me there is nothing they can do because their computer does not show anything is wrong. Tech at Jeep says to fix nothing until it duplicates this problem while the dealership is test-driving it. Help!",0
"My Jeep Liberty 2005 all of a sudden would not start. My husband, who is a mechanic, researched the problem and tried to buy the part from our local dealer. We were told that the part was not serviceable and we would have to buy a re-manufactured steering column for $800.00 + core charge. Catch was that over 800 people were ahead of us on a waiting list. We researched online and, thanks to my husband, found the part needed. It was an ignition actuator pin that was under $40.00. It solved the problem. $800.00 vs $40.00, not a question. For others out there, the part number is 924-704.",0
"I would like to inform you about problems with my 2010 jeep. It only has 40000 mi. on it. First of all, I purchased the extended warranty with $100 deductible. Nov. 2012 was the first prob. - a recall for a guard that could collect debris and catch fire. Chrysler fixed that prob. - I applaud them for that. The next prob. was when driving down the road, the dash lights and ABS ESP skid control lights came on also lost cruise control. The extended warranty fixed that with $100 deductible. That was fine. In March 2013, it was the same thing - dash lights acted up the same as it did in November but they say it is not the same thing. This time, they say it is corded wires that could cause fire. Okay, this may be true although how it is not related to the module that caused the same lights to light up and have same exact affect as before, I do not understand. This cost me another $100. 
      We have been with Chrysler products since 1969 but yet to buy one without problems. I am getting fed up! I guess the joke is on me for staying loyal and true so long with Chrysler. My wife worked for Chrysler for 33 yrs and Chrysler provided us with a living so I felt it only fair to buy their products. It's not so much now that we are on a fixed income. Whatever the problems which I don't understand - same light, same exact problem but they say it is not the same. If more problems happen, I will just paint ""lemon"" on the jeep and drive it around like that. Anyone that stops and asks questions, I will explain the ""service"" that I got. Thanks for listening.",0

"I bought this 2006 Jeep Liberty Limited new in January 2007. On March 19, 2010, the driver's rear power window regulator broke and the window will not go up. I brought it to the dealer to have it fixed. Luckily, I have extended warranty and just paid a $50 deductible. Today, Feb. 19, 2013, the driver's rear power window regulator broke again and luckily the extended warranty is still good until January 2014. I have to pay another $50 deductible. Even the service advisor said the Jeep 2006 Liberty do have a lot of people having problem with the rear window regulator.
      Based on this history with this Jeep Liberty model year having problem with the rear window regulator again and again on so many owners that bought this Jeep Liberty model, it should be a manufacture defect and it should be recalled. If I did not have extended warranty, it would have cost me $250 to have it fixed. Who knows how many times the power window regulator will break down for years to come?",0

"I purchased 3 new 2005 Liberty from 2 different dealers at the same time. As the single owners and used in our business, they are on the road 24/7 and are now at 200,000-250,000 miles. From day one, we have complained to the local dealer to no avail, who blew it off and never made any reports. When filling the tanks with gas on each Liberty, they spill over every time before the gas hose nozzle shuts off. It does not matter what gas station you go to. They all do the same spill over down the side of the car and onto the rear left wheels.
      The issue is none of our other cars do that. Fire is a real danger each time. We have to guess at about how much to fill the tank so it does not come up the next so fast before the pump can shut off. We operate several other cars at the time and have no problems with the auto shut off. We perceive the gas tank neck is too short or fills too fast trigger the shut off at the pump. There must be a design defect that spills gas over the fender about a pint each time you try to fill the tank at the full level. All 3 Jeeps do the same scenario. It's a 2005 design defect. A real safety hazard exists.",1

"2007 Jeep Patriot - The engine will not go over 2,000 rpm. I've tried everything. This vehicle sucks!",0
"I recently purchased a used 2007 Jeep Commander with a 5.7L HEMI engine. Before I bought the Jeep, I took it to a Jeep dealership and paid $150 to have a full inspection done. They passed the Jeep so I bought it two weeks ago. In the last two weeks, the Jeep has stalled three times whilst in motion! Last night, it stalled going 75mph on the freeway with kids in the car! This is just not safe! I called the NHTSA and they opened a case for me, but that's all they did for me. 
      I called Jeep Customer Care, and they just told me I need to take it to a dealer and pay to have them diagnose it. I said, ""I just paid $150 for that."" But no, they want me to pay a new fee for a new test. If you look online, this is obviously a very dangerous and very common problem with Jeep Commanders. (I wish I knew before I bought it.) How can Jeep get away with not recalling all of them? How can only certain years be eligible for recall? This is very unsafe. What will it take before Jeep takes action? A death? I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do.",0
"My wife was driving our 2010 Jeep Liberty and pulled out from a red light. The Jeep would not stop accelerating and she was going 60mph in a 25mph. She was pushing the brake with one foot and holding the gas pedal up with the other foot to try to get it to stop. It wouldn't stop until she put it in neutral. The brake should override the gas pedal but didn't. This Jeep had the APP sensor replaced due to defect 11 months ago and after being towed to dealership, I was told it was the floor mat that came with the vehicle from the dealership. It was towed back to our home where it still sits undriven. I can't believe after two incidents they act as if we are making this up. There seems to be issues with Jeep's drive by wire system and the APP sensor is an issue. Why not leave the old cable system alone? It worked fine for 50+ years.",0
"On August 29, 2012, I brought my 2010 Jeep Liberty (26k miles) to DarCars Jeep in Rockville, Maryland because my Sky Slider would not close. My Liberty was in the shop for 80, yes, eighty days! The shop replaced the Sky Slider two times, Jeep engineers flew out from Detroit, and then the manufacturer of the Sky Slider built a new one on the factory floor. Yay, it appears to work but I am selling it, I refuse to own a car from a dealership that cannot stand behind their product. Not only has Chrysler Jeep refused to take ownership of the defective Sky Slider they are refusing to cover the 77 days I had a rental. So, I pay a monthly car loan for a car I cannot drive then have to pay $2k in rental fees on top of it.
      I have written letters to Customer Relations (following the warranty guidelines for complaints) only to be told they were transferring my problem to another department. I still haven't heard from anyone at Chrysler Jeep. This is my second Jeep - my last Jeep. Jeep has refused to stand behind their product. Jeep's dealership (the face of Jeep to the public) continuously ignored me during the 80 days my car was there. I would have to call three to four times a day to find out the status of my Jeep. When I asked if they could provide me a contact at Chrysler Jeep they said they would handle everything. Who is going to handle my $2k in rental? Single Moms, don't buy a Jeep. Get a car/truck/SUV from a company that actually works for their customer and stands behind their product because if it was up to Jeep I wouldn't have gotten to work every day, my kids to school and their activities.",0
"I purchased a 2008 Jeep Compass from Massey on Friday, October 26, 2012. On the way to work the following day, something happened inside the transmission that caused major damage. After the sun was up, I looked at what I could and called Eric, my salesman. He told me to bring it back to be checked over. I drove the vehicle back into the dealership and dropped it off on Saturday, October 27 (less than 24 hours after purchase). After numerous phone calls, I was informed that they would not warrant the vehicle, stating I was doing burnouts or something and ruined the transmission (Matt). Trying to use the chain of command at the dealership, I was informed by the owner Faith Massey that they indeed would not stand behind their warranty and to get that vehicle off the lot.",0
"I have had my Jeep Wrangler Sport Unlimited 4-door since September 7, 2012. The first heavy rain we had here in San Antonio, Texas left the driver side floor with a small puddle of water. The next screwed up thing that happened was the zipper broke on the rear window on the driver's side. I took in the Jeep to get the leak fixed; it still leaks. I contacted the dealership (Ancira Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram in San Antonio, Texas) and found out that the service department has to find someone to re-sew the zipper. They have to find someone who will do this within the price Chrysler gave them. I paid a lot of money for this Jeep and the last I want is to have my zipper sewn back on! That's **! I want my window fixed correctly! And if the whole top has to be replaced, then replace it! It's your screw up and you need to fix your screw up and if it's going to cost you, too bad! Don't forget Chrysler - we bailed your ** out of trouble and you owe us! Get your ** together and fix your problems!",0
"Pre mature wear of rear brakes 2010 Jeep Renegade  - I came in for my oil change. I have 12000 miles. They came and told me my rear brakes where worn down and I needed a brake job for $400. I had it done and got on the phone to Chrysler to file a complaint. The rear brakes should outlast the front by 3 times. The fronts are ok. I see many others with the same problems but on 2010 & 2009 vans. They agreed they should have not worn out and sent me a check for the repair done. They could not assure they would not wear out again in 12000 miles or less. The service manager said a lot of them have the same problem. I think it is a real safety concern. 
      I went to a speed shop and they told me it happens often to Chrysler products as the brake system has a poor design and cannot handle the weight of the 2009 & 2010. He told me next time to replace their rotors with double cross drilled rotors and that solved the problem for others. I think this Jeep is unsafe now because of the bad brake wear down and all they can do is issue a refund instead of solving the real problem. Now I have to worry about brake safety and have a pair of rotors waiting for the next time they wear out in less than 12000 miles. I hope others with the same problem will report it to Chrysler so they can make changes and resolve the problem that many are having with premature brake and rotor wear.",0
"I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty Limited which I purchased new. It has always been garage kept and never abused. At 77,000 miles, the rear differential needs to be overhauled according to North Tampa Jeep dealership. I filed a complaint and was given a case number by a lady named Jan at the Jeep Consumer Affairs Corp. I took my Jeep for a diagnosis at the aforementioned dealership, which cost me $104 out of pocket at the suggestion of Jan.
      Jan contacts me a day later and tells me Jeep will not cover the $2,300 repair because that is normal wear and tear. I asked Jan how many rear differentials go out at 77,000 miles and she could not answer me. My Jeep is not a 4-wheel drive nor have I towed anything with my Jeep. What happen to ""Jeep Tough.” It's wrong that Jeep won't cover the repairs - no, they will cover my out of pocket the diagnosis for $104.This is not my first new Jeep, but it will be my last Jeep. Jeep will not stand behind their vehicles in or out of warranty. This is very rare that the differential just happen to be out in my Jeep. Jan apparently has no supervisor above her. Her number is **. Voice your opinion on my behalf if you think Jeep was not fair with my complaint. Thank you.",0
"Brand new loser cars from 1996 to 2012: I've been a faithful customer to Chrysler vehicles for over 17 years and every product that we have purchased always resulted in having a serious problem(s). We would have the vehicle serviced and traded up and purchase a new vehicle. The trust in your car products and materials has been irretrievably shattered. I purchased a brand new 1996 Chrysler Sebring which had consistent problems, traded up, purchased a brand new 1998 Chrysler Concorde that had transmission locked up, paid the car off and purchased a 2003 fully loaded Jeep Liberty. What a travesty. 
      Here I am again, old faithful, believing this vehicle will be different psych. With every vehicle I purchased, things never got any better, only more repair bills. Currently, I'm at Russ Darrow on S. 108th Street with outrageous repair costs on my Jeep including consistent ABS brake light problems, unresolved engine light problems, replaced air compression motor & pulley drive system, belts locked up, transmission leaking, water reservoir and of course, it's nobody's fault. After keeping up with all my maintenance checks on all my cars with the dealership, I still can't keep a vehicle that can run successfully past 70,000 miles before requiring major repair. This is ridiculous. At this point, I am no longer interested in purchasing another Chrysler product ever as long as I live! I will be following up with a complaint with to the BBB and anyone else that will hear my complaint.",0
"I have a 2008 Jeep Liberty with an extended manufacturer's warranty. On Sept. 17, 2012, while traveling on the interstate, I accelerated to pass a vehicle and the pedal stuck. This has been happening randomly since the first incident. I removed the floor mats to make sure that was not the issue. The dealership was able to duplicate the problem on their first try. This is not covered under the ext. mfg. warranty as it is considered ""an accessory"" (yes, I quote) even though it is listed as ""Miscellaneous Electrical System Repair"" on the dealership's service order. They want $385 to fix this issue. Chrysler Customer Care said ""due to your car's status, and you being the 2nd owner, there's nothing we can do."" First I don't see how an accelerator pedal is an accessory and secondly do not see how this should be my liability. I'm extremely frustrated and angry. Anyone else have this problem?",0
"I purchased a 2010 Jeep Compass in April 27, 2012 with 27,000 miles at the time of purchase. I fell in love with the car. I asked the GM for a Carfax. I did not get the Carfax until after I purchased the car. After I purchased the car, the next day, when I drove the car home, the gas gauge was not working. I called the GM, I took the car back, put it in the shop for a week, then the gas gauge was fixed. After that, the engine light came on, which they fixed. Three weeks later, it was back in the shop as there was a knocking under the car and the engine light came back on.
      When I picked up the car, they said that they had to replace the sign section. On June 12, the car was back in the shop as it was still having the knocking noise under the car. I reminded the supervisor of the noise and he said that he did not hear anything. On July 4 through July 30, Don Jackson had my Jeep for 30 days because the air went out. When I received my car back on July 30, the knocking noise was still there. The GM informed me that the car isn't new.I took my car to Don Jackson Jeep on September 17, 2012. I had an appointment to get my car serviced. I stayed at the dealer from 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM. The tech named Michael came out and informed me that the owner and the GM are working to get me another car, that there is something wrong with my car, that I can drive the car home and they will call me back on that evening - there was no call back.I called them on Friday, September 21, to see what is going on. I left a message but there was no answer. I called again that Monday, September 24. I learned that Michael no longer worked there and I still have not received any call back from them. I called again on September 25 and 26, left messages for the GM of Don Jackson Jeep to call me back today, September 27. Still, no answer.I have received 3 letters stating I was denied credit for a car loan. I did not agree or authorized their credit application and Don Jackson Jeep is sending my credit application to a different finance company. My credit score has dropped due to their inquiries and I recommend that I get a car to replace my lemon car with equal or greater value without a cost to me. Please feel free to contact me.",0
"No fender for Jeep Patriot in South Africa - I've been without my car for 5 weeks as West Rand Panel Beaters were not able to find/source a fender in S.A. They have referred me to Albert **, Parts Sales Executive of Chrysler Jeep Dodge Fourways and I've been told to log a complaint as the part is currently being shipped in from U.S.A. How can a brand as big as Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler not have such common parts in S.A? I'm really frustrated. I work for FNB Cellphone Banking and I know what service is and this is a load of **.

"Brand new car broke down - New car overheated in the week it was to be repaired! During this time, no one even apologized and offered to give me another car in return! Friday, I took it and it turned out that the cause of failure has not been arranged and the car overheats again! I depend on my car, and a week I had to sit home and not work! I do not know now how long do I have to wait! I called customer service, Jeep and nothing good has happened! Please help! I am paying now for what I don’t have!",0
"While driving on vacation, on the 2nd day, my 2008 Jeep at 41,138 gave out on the transmission. I had to stop in MS State for repairs costing $3,699.13+135.60 car rental. Upon returning home, I called Chrysler who is willing to pay only $1,500 with no explanation or were concerned as to why the Jeep did what it did. I have been at this since August 14. Today, I am told the check for $1,500 is on the way but I have asked them to reopen the case as I am still not satisfied nor was I given any reasons except that the Jeep loaner has any warranties. It seems the Jeep had three years, 36,000 and no more. My question was whatever happened to power train warranty of 80,000/100,000?
      I find Chrysler staff incompetent to do their job in dealing with their customer and has no lack of concern over this early transmission issue with the Jeep. Mind you, they acknowledged it is an early problem but because they feel there is no warranty with the car, they were not going to further review why the transmission failed. They never called the dealership where it was repaired to this day. I have reported them to the TX AG and NHTSA/DOT and will continue to post this issue on any website that will alert any consumers on this automaker. Now that the case has been reopened, I will wait and see what the outcome will be the second time around. There was a day when I asked for the Chrysler corporation's phone number. The operator gave me to their roadside assistant line.I am very angry and very frustrated at the way I have been treated. By the way, they not only asked me for the repair bill. They had the gall to ask me for my credit card statement to show that I really did pay for the repairs of $3,699.13. How do you like that for treatment by Chrysler Customer Care? I would like all Chrysler owners to review their warranty and those that are thinking of buying any Chrysler products, read the warranty book before buying their cars.",0
"I bought a 2012 Jeep Liberty Latitude on 8/13/12. My sales experience was great, I must admit; however, I have had this vehicle 3 weeks and have had it in the shop 3 times for the same issue! They did nothing the first time, cleared the codes, told me to bring it back if it happened again and they would fix the problem. This is after being there for 4 hours. 2 days later I have the same issue. I took it back to the shop and 6 hours later I am told they still are not sure why it is happening after they put 25-plus miles on it test driving it and said they rotated the tires and need to see if I am having a control module issue or a TPMS issue. 
      They said to bring it back if it happens again. Two days later, it happened again and so today I dropped it off at about 9 am. At around 4 pm, I get a phone call that they need to keep it overnight and they will set me up with a rental. They cannot find the control module they are looking for. It’s not where the book says it is. Now, I am really aggravated. I bought a brand new vehicle so I would not have these problems and yet in 3 weeks they have had the vehicle 3 different times and now overnight! I’m calling to complain to Jeep. I’m not sure it will do me any good; however, I believe this will fall under the Virginia lemon law.",0
"I am experiencing an engine stall problem. I bought the car (Jeep Commander) in the UK for 136 thousand. A similar car has been recalled in the US, but nothing is being done in the UK. I don't know where to complain, and I think it is a manufacturer's fault.",0
I was driving to see a friend and the 2006 Jeep Commander stalled. I had to restart the Commander and then we were on our way. We also have an issue of the dash lights blinking when we hit a bump or rough roads.,0
"Jeep does not stand by their product! Sorry everyone for my rant, but I have to go off about Jeep customer service and how awful they are! We have had a Jeep Liberty for 6 years which we bought brand new. We have had to replace every window twice, one - three times, the air compressor three times, the relay switch, the battery three times, the cruise control doesn't work (and hasn't for 4 years!), and the heat doesn't work when it gets really cold (so when you need it!), and now the car just dies for no reason despite regular maintenance! 
      Jeep customer service’s response to every single one of these claims (with the exception of the windows since that is something every 2006 Liberty is experiencing) is ""Not our problem!"" All I asked them to do is take their piece of crap car back! Would they do it? Nope, it’s not their problem. They said you can try to get out of under the car at your own discretion. So, tell me, if their cars are so great, why don't they want them back? Because they are awful cars! Don't ever, ever, ever buy a Jeep! They are awful and will not last. Do not buy a Jeep!",0
"The problem began initially in 4/2010 when the vehicle had 53,165 miles on it and the engine would idle roughly, the ESP/BAS indicator would come on, the check engine light would come on, and the traction assist indicator would all come on at the same time. As soon as all the indicators would light, the car would handle poorly, not shift properly, and at times simply stall out on the highway. I brought the car to my local Jeep dealership and upon inspection, they found that the intake manifold had melted and come apart; thus, it needed to be replaced at a cost of $485, which was fine considering the car overall had not given me many major problems. So, I proceeded to have the work done. 
      A couple of weeks ago, the same problems began happening again (the engine would idle roughly, the ESP/BAS indicator would come on, the check engine light would come on, and the traction assist indicator would all come on at the same time), so I brought the car back to the same dealership. Upon inspection, they found that once again, the intake manifold had melted and come apart, thus it needed to be replaced at a cost this time of $685. Mind you, the car now has 96,057 miles. My main concern is that the intake manifold lasted only 42,901 miles and had to be replaced once again. I voiced my concerns to my service advisor and he stated that the first time the upper manifold had gone bad and that this time the lower manifold had gone bad. That may very well be the case but if you look at the invoices, the part numbers are exactly the same (53032774AA). I understand that the dealership can only do so much, so I am now appealing to you as it seems that the intake manifold for my 2006 Jeep Commander has a factory defect as it literally melts and begins to come apart especially with the extremely hot weather in South Florida every 40,000 miles or so.I wrote a letter to Chrysler and received an email asking me to call their customer assistance center. I called and was basically told that there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager and Daniel refused to let me do so saying that he had the final decision on my claim. Needless to say, I am getting rid of this crappy car and I will never spend my money on a Jeep again as they do not stand behind their product as some of their foreign competitors do.",0
"While driving my two young children, my 2010 Jeep Commander has been stalling while driving. The car completely shut down without warning. I have been working with the service department but they can't seem to repair it. Instead of making sure that I am safe, they continue to replace parts without knowing if it will fix the problem. It is very scary when this happens and I'm afraid for my life and my children.",0
"The 4-year-old 2008 Jeep Commander has rust and two big spots on the hood. The dealership in CT won't fix it as it’s not under warranty. So, if you expect your paint to last more than 4 years, you may want to look at other cars.",0
"I have a 2011 Jeep Wrangler 4-door. My soft top leaks which causes a horrible, moldy smell inside the car. Every time that it rains, I have to take all the car mats out of the jeep and dry the rugs with a towel. I then have to go to the back area where there is a storage compartment and scoop out the water that puddles up inside it. I will then keep all the windows open once the sun is out to let the car dry out. The smell still remains for days after. I was stuck in a rainstorm and water was leaking in all around the top of the door. My left arm and leg were both soaked by the time I got to my destination. I am taking the car to the dealer to be evaluated. I asked them if they have been getting many complaints about this and they said no. I don't believe them because I even got a letter from a lawyer who is putting together a lawsuit on behalf of Jeep owners because of mold and electrical problems, which are brought on by the leaky roofs. I hope they do the right thing for me. I am glad that this car is a lease and I will get rid of it in another year. Never again.",0
"My wife and I have owned Jeeps since 1996. In 2009, I purchased a 2009 Jeep Patriot for her.

"2012 Jeep Liberty automatic transmission has a loud ""clunk"" when up-shifting or down-shifting. It sounds like it's coming from transmission or drive shaft u-joint. I took it to the dealership and the technician replicated the problem on the Jeep as well as another Jeep on their lot. The dealership contacted Chrysler and was told that Chrysler was aware of the problem, but has no ""fix"" or ""repair"" to correct it. They stated that it may be a software problem with the transmission ""control module""(?). This has happened ever since the Jeep was new and it now has 5,000 miles on it. One of these days, the transmission and/or drive shaft is going to being lying on the road. And, all this time, Chrysler admits that they have a problem!",0
"I purchased my 2007 Liberty used in 2009. I immediately began having trouble with the windows. The mechanisms were faulty and all the windows fell, one by one! Although the warranty had ran out, Chrysler replaced all four. Now, it's the air compressor! They said the compressor, dryer and lines all need replacing which is going to cost an outrageous $1,100.00! Ugh! I will have to get a loan in order to pay them for the work they are supposed to be doing, which has not been done after a week in the shop. 
      I waited a week, called and checked on my Liberty. Well, now they can't find the parts! All the dealer’s list has having them on their shelves, but they actually don't. This past February, I actually thought about trading it in on a new Honda Civic. Yes, I am feeling a hard kick in the backside right now for not doing it. Let this be a warning to all those that are looking to go with a Chrysler product. Buyers beware!",0
"My radio has a 30-gb hard drive in it. The idea is to be able to load music and pictures and music. The problem is the radio doesn't recognize the USB port, making that option useless. I made 2 attempts to have it fixed. There is no fix and they have no plans to correct the situation.",0
"I took the car to Advance to see why the engine light keeps coming on and why the car was blowing heat. They hooked it up and said that was a small leak and that it could be the gas cap. We fixed the cap and went on. After a we drove and the car got to half a tank, the engine light came back on again. Now back to the air conditioner. We have been back and forth with this. I took the car to the place that fixes my Lincoln, and they saw there was a leak coming out of the jeep from the air conditioner. He told me since it was under warranty, to take it to a jeep dealer. I took it to Five Star in Macon, and they said there wasn't a leak. They put Freon in the jeep and made note of what I said. 
      Two days later, the car was hot again. I took the car back, and they said there was a leak and they needed to order the part. They fixed the jeep, and then, it went out again. I had to go out of town and I had to ride with no heat. On top of that, my children had to ride in it the entire time without any air. That is dangerous to anyone and mainly children. I drove around in Atlanta for a week because of the scheduling and being able to come back so they could fix it. They explained that if I got a rental, they wouldn't cover the days that the jeep was fixed. I just dropped the jeep again, and if its not done right again, what do I as a customer do? This is crazy that we were forced to ride in 117-degree weather and then some. As a customer, I am so angry and dissatisfied with the service that I have gotten.",0
"The a/c stopped working in my 12-year old Jeep. My regular mechanic couldn't figure out what the problem was, and suggested I go to a Jeep dealer who might be able to figure it out. I went to Manfredi. The staff acts like they are doing you a favor by letting you pay them a lot of money to not fix your car. Terrible customer service. They rush you in to a service rep who doesn't even bother to make eye contact. They'll tell you they are going to call you with an estimate. Don't expect to hear from them. You have to chase them down and then they act like you are a nuisance for bothering them. They replaced the accumulator for $700 and the a/c worked for four hours. 
      I returned the car to them on Monday, and it took them 5 days to figure out the problem was a leak in the evaporator, which they conveniently blamed on my original mechanic. They said they would fix it but it would be at least four hours labor (at $99 p/h) plus parts. Rather than put any more money into the old car, I told them I would pass on it. I now have a new accumulator that I didn't need and the a/c is still not working. No one could explain why the evaporator leak didn't show up in their original diagnostic.I thought about fighting to get the $700 back, but realized I would get nowhere. I had planned to buy a new Jeep in the fall anyway; the old one will go to my nephew. But I will never deal with Manfredi again. They can keep the $700. I'll give my $25,000+ to another Jeep dealer.",0
"Major car problem, don't buy a Jeep. I purchased a 2012 Jeep Patriot in December of 2011. I was in the process of moving 900 miles over the 4th of July weekend 2012 when the car just stalled on the inter-state. Neither the highway patrol person, the tow person nor myself was able to get it to start. I had to have it towed and my U-Haul trailer towed separately (at my expense) 20 miles away to the nearest Chrysler dealer, where it sat for 3 days before anyone could look at it. Meanwhile, in order to continue my move, I had to borrow my son-in law's vehicle with a trailer hitch because there is no rental agency that will rent a car with a hitch to tow. I drove to my new home and now have to drive back 800 miles to pick up my car. Will Jeep reimburse me for my time, the gas for 2 extra trips, the hotel or even the meals? No, Jeep says that I should have gotten a rental even though I couldn't get a rental, so no luck. The service department where my car was checked says that they could find nothing wrong but that they were told by Chrysler corporate office that there have been other instances of this happening with no apparent cause. So I'm supposed to drive 800 miles and pick up my car and just 'hope' for the best.",0
"I bought a lemon! I am so disappointed in Jeep. I don't know where to start. This SUV is costing me more than a mortgage payment. I take very good care of this car, and in return, it kills me! I have 49,000 miles on this 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and the air conditioning went out in 2009. The cooling pump went out last month, and now, the ignition is gone! I need a phone number to someone who can help me. I'm dumping this heap of crap and going back to Honda. I saved forever to get the car of my dreams. Now, it's nothing but a nightmare! Anyone have 1,220 bucks to pay for the latest repair? You're killing me! Please, give me a number! This car was bought at Global Auto Mall in North, Plainfield, NJ.",0
"Ok, I had an issue with my jeep stalling as I was driving. There's no noise, it ran quietly, but it just stalled. After a little while, I got it started and I went straight home gassing it to get there, then I parked it. After a couple of hours, I went back out to start it and it fired up like no problem occurred! But the next time I got in it, it started; and it was heading down the road, and it stalled on me again in the middle of an intersection endangering my life! Thank God, I had help after an hour or so; and I got it pulled into a parking lot to be towed later. We were told it was probably the fuel filter or pump going bad. So we forked out $200 to get it changed. Did that change the problem? No. It started up again. I took it down the road and it stalled out again. So with this going on, I did some digging on the internet and found others were having these issues.
      A lot were saying that the PCM module is bad. So I called Jeep to find out about a recall on the PCM module. They said I had to take it to one of their service places to get verification that this was the issue. They couldn't get it to start and said I needed to change an SKIM module ($375.00). It's more out-of-pocket. The reason the SKIM module got burned out, by what the mechanic said, was because of the power control module. So now that 1 month or so has passed and my daughter has a heart condition and my mother is 3 hours away having quadruple bypass surgery, I don't have a vehicle to get there and be with her. And I finally got a response from Jeep Daimler Chrysler that it isn't under warranty to be fixed. Even though it's their malfunctioning part that was put on the vehicle when made, they don't want to be accountable for it. So either we pay the $800.00 for the PCM module or I don't have a reliable safe-driving vehicle. How can manufacturers get away with this?",0
"I purchased a 2012 Jeep Patriot Latitude in February 2012. I immediately noticed problems with the wiper blades coming on, dash lights began to dim, radio light display unable to see. I set a service appointment with dealer purchased from. Their review of problem was no problem could be located, even after I typed a detailed list of the items mentioned. Well, here we go again. I set the service appointment again, as the problems have gotten worse, now the AC will not cool and with the wiper, dash lights, radio display are still not working properly. So, I will see what the service department says tomorrow. Unfortunately, I paid cash for the thing, and what a mistake that was. I am 76 year old, gray-headed female; tell me out there, will I need an attorney to get the dealership to stand behind the warranty? Has anyone else had this type of electrical problems with their new 2012 Jeep Patriot?",0
"Was my Jeep painted at 4:45pm on a Friday? And the BBB is useless - First said, I love my Jeep and want no other car. This complaint is solely on shoddy workmanship and inspection practices. At purchase, I did notice bumpy paint on the door hinges and on one hood hinge, I was not concerned at time; I was excited to get my Jeep. My boyfriend made the comment that I need to get it looked at because he thought these were air bubbles and would eventually begin to flake. Well, one of them finally flaked; I took it to the dealer. I had seen a Jeep just like mine the week before with the same paint flaws. It happened to be the same color as my Jeep so I thought it was a defect in that particular paint color. Well, the dealer said it was rust and they have seen several vehicles in multiple colors with this same issue. They said the factory painted over rust, rust?! 
      The dealer took photos and submitted them to corporate with estimates and was shot down each time. At one time I asked my contact, “Since I brought my Jeep in at just fewer than 50K miles, you think they (corporate) may be stalling for me to hit the 50K?” He said it does make it harder to get things done “after the 36,000” is up, but we will see. Well, I guess since it is my fault that the paint finally flaked after 36,000 miles, the Chrysler Corporation does not feel they are in need of fixing something that should not have left their factory floor in the first place. I even shelled out $3K+ for the lifetime service and power train warranties, still nothing. No wonder people hate buying American goods. Our eyes for detail stink especially if you get an inspector at 4:50pm on a Friday reviewing what is about to be shipped to a sales floor. I will be submitting this complaint to the BBB, and various consumer watchdogs. Thanks for your time in reading this. The above letter is what I e-mailed to Chrysler yesterday and it was probably scoffed at because as I contacted the BBB today, via my phone, I got this automated message that told me that Jeep was ""one"" of the dealers that did not participate in the BBB’s Auto Line Program and that I should consult my owner’s manual or press 1 for the directory of the auto service manufactures, **? Companies can choose if they want to receive BBB complaints or not? I thought the BBB was there to help resolve the issues and instead it is directing me back to the corporation that does not want to resolve the product defect in the first place? Attorneys, possible class action suit as I have seen and heard of other Jeeps with this issue?",0
"On or about May 16, 2012, I began experiencing a horrible ""mold"" type odor emitting from my AC unit of our 2012 Jeep Liberty. On May 21, 2012, I brought our 2012 Jeep Liberty to the service department of the Faricy Boys Jeep Dealer in Colorado Springs, CO. They kept the vehicle for two days, diagnosed the problem and replaced the evaporator core. I picked up the Jeep and immediately detected a rubber type odor. I contacted the service adviser and was informed that the odor was the coating on the new evaporator core and would disappear in a couple of days.
      On June 1, 2012, while driving to work, I experienced the same odor and again returned the Jeep. I spoke with the service manager, who agreed the moldy odor still exists. He suggested possibly misting the vehicle to get rid of the smell. This was unacceptable and would only mask the cause. The Jeep was left at the dealership again with a request for a loaner vehicle. The service manager informed me that it was not their policy to provide loaner vehicles. We are making monthly payments of a new vehicle purchased by us to provide necessary transportation. We now do not have use of the vehicle due to a defective AC systems or component and are required to submit to the policies of the Jeep dealership. Jeep engineers have been contacted by the mechanic and have suggested contaminated antifreeze. This Jeep is an absolute lemon and we want it returned to the dealership.",0
"Remote Start for Our Jeep Wrangler - We have had so much grief with the Remote Start for our Jeep. It was installed and taken out several times because when we engage it, all the dashboard lights go on, the engine races, we are able to take the key out and it is still running. We step on the brake as we were told to do and still all dashboard lights are on and the engine is on and revving! After the car finally shuts off, the check engine light stays on. 
      I spoke to Joe from Finance to see if we could have our money back since Howie took the Remote Start out and the Jeep was working fine with no problems. Joe was very rude and condescending to me. He insisted that we should have never had it taken out and must have it installed again. My wife called Joe on the phone that same day and he was just as rude and condescending to her. Joe told her that this was not a piece of candy we could return to the candy store two months later. So, at Joe's insistence, Aaron had Howie reinstall the Remote Start. Since then, we have had the same troubles again! Today we videotaped it to show them this was not a lie or something out of our imagination. Mr Manfredi, we bought 2 cars this year, a Dodge Avenger and the Jeep (February and March), both with Remote Starters. My Avenger's remote starter works perfectly. The Jeep has been a nightmare that seems to have no end. Supposedly, Tony is now working on it. Why can't we have it removed? We are moving to Florida in mid-June and will be driving the Jeep down. We are afraid of what might happen! Please. Please help us solve this craziness. I am sorry to have to come to you, but we are not getting any satisfaction from anyone else. The cars are under my wife's name. Aaron has been a gem through all of this but says his hands are tied when it comes to solving this. It would be greatly appreciated if you could take a look at this and get back to us. I hope I downloaded the video right. If not, I have it on my cell phone.",0
"The water pump on my 2009 Jeep Liberty went bad at 35,000 miles. It is 2 weeks out of warranty and they will not fix it. To top it off, when the case manager said that they will not approve the fix, she would also not let me speak with her supervisor or anyone else. Apparently, they let their lower level case managers make the final decision. A water pump should not go bad for 150,000 miles on today's vehicles. I am starting my anti-Chrysler/Jeep campaign today. I will never buy one again. It is a shame that this is what American car companies have come to. They can't design and make equipment that last past 35,000 miles without breaking.",0
"We purchased our 2007 Jeep Commander with less than 30,000 miles and the car only had one owner. Several months after purchasing the car, we had several instances where the car would just shut off. We took it to a local Jeep dealership a couple of times and they said they could not find anything wrong. Six months after we bought the car, it left me stranded in December at 10 pm on a major highway. I had to have it towed. The water pump went out. I was able to pull over as soon as the engine light came on. We had the repair done, but the car always had a slight vibration and just did not seem to have the power it once had.
      We took it to the dealer three times after that. The first time, they said they could not find anything wrong. The second time they adjusted something and the engine light, that had come on, went off. They said everything was okay. After two days, the engine light came on again. We took it back and they said one of the coils was bad, so we replaced it. Two weeks later, I left work and the car was vibrating so hard when I started it. I thought the engine was going to blow right there. I turned the car off and had it towed to the dealership on 2/17/12 and as of 5/22/12, it is still there. They replaced the engine and the new engine overheated due to a defective part. We were advised a new part was ordered, but we are still waiting.We went to get the VIN off of the car about a week ago to turn off our satellite radio since we were not getting to use it and a rat had built a nest in the dashboard and chewed our owner's manual. They have had our car for almost 3 and 1/2 months. We have been dealing with Chrysler's customer care along with the dealership, but that has been a disappointment at best. They give us dates of when the part will arrive after we call, but they don't follow up on anything. If we don't call, we get no information. I have owned a Ford Escort that I bought new and drove it for 13 years until someone hit it and it could not be repaired. I have a 2000 Honda CRV that I bought new and after all these years, I am just now having to repair the air conditioner and some other minor things due to wear and tear over the years (the Honda now has 180,000 miles).I have bought several other used cars which I paid only a few thousand for and have never really had any problems with them. This is my first experience with a Chrysler product and I will never purchase another Chrysler again. After doing some research, I now see the issue with the car shutting off was a known issue with a module and they knew it all along and lied to us about it rather than trying to fix it. They might look good from the outside, but the craftsmanship and the service were terrible.",0
"I have a 2012 Jeep Rubicon that is sitting under a tarp at the dealership I purchased it from, waiting for a replacement cylinder head. Apparently, this is a known issue to Chrysler and instead of contacting owners to replace the heads, they are riding it out to see who all complains about it. Well, mine has cracked and two weeks later still no cylinder head. I opened a case with Chrysler Jeep customer care and have a case number. Finally, I talked to my case manager after four days of calling and he tells me it will be another week before the dealership even gets the new one and refuses to escalate my complaint higher. I have a $38,000 vehicle and I can't drive it. What am I driving? A Ford Focus. Really? Not even comparable. Beyond angry.",0
"I was pulling out of a parking lot onto a busy highway, when my 2008 Jeep Wrangler started honking and the lights started flashing. It stalled for a few seconds, then I started driving again. I made it 1/2 block to the stop lights, at which time, it did it again and stalled completely. I was able to coast through the stop light and turn onto a side street, where it stopped in a very unsafe area. 
      I immediately called for help and couldn't even get to make my hazards go on. We have since had it towed to a dealership, and we are waiting to see what they come up with. 1 month ago, the stabilizer bar went, causing us to be thrown into oncoming traffic over in Detroit. We had that fixed (quite a cost) and found out this is also a common issue with these jeeps. From reading on the internet, both these things are common problems, but Jeep will not own up to these things. These trucks are horrible and unsafe! We bought ours new, and we have never gone 4x4ing or abused it in any way! We still owe 2 years of payments on this piece of junk, and we are afraid to drive it, because it is a death trap!",0
"I had top and bottom ball joints go bad on my 2003 Jeep liberty and the dealership in Slidell was going to replace them because there was a recall on them. Chrysler claims there was no recall. At first, they said I should have waited for the part to come in at the dealership in Slidell. The part never did come in and if my son wouldn't have changed the part, who was going to pay for the accident? Then they claim it was taken care of in 2006. If they would have changed them in 2006 which they didn't, don't you think six years is a very short life span for ball joints? Why does the government keep bailing these car companies out when they are cheating the American people? I am very unhappy about all the lies and I think they should pay for the job.",0
The Electronic Shift Modules are faulty on 2006 model Jeep Commander Esmeralda. The manufacturer is aware of the problem and refuses to recall the product or make part available outside of the dealer. This simple fix has cost me hundreds of dollars to fix twice. I'm on my third repair and the dealer will not admit faulty craftsmanship.,0
"I have a 2003 Jeep Liberty and I was having problems with top and bottom balljoints. On the internet I saw there was a recall on them. When the dealership who said there was a recall tried to order them, they still never came in because the dealership can't seem to get them in. My son had to change them because they were so bad. We couldn't wait for them or I would have had an accident. When I got hold of them at the corporate office, all they did was lie. They said that they were changed in 2006. Does anybody see anything wrong with that? Since when do the top and bottom ball joints go out in less than 6 years? They also said there wasn't a recall. They just won't own up to their mistakes. I am not at all happy with Chrysler. They should pay for the ball joints, not me.",0
"I am the sole driver of my 2007 Jeep Sahara. I never took it out bogging and is extremely clean. I get teased all the time why I don't get it dirty. Power train warranty was 100000 km or 5 years, whatever came first. I'm up at 108000 and it will be 5 years in 2 weeks. This is my third Jeep, and have owned two Rams, so I consider myself a good Chrysler customer. Well to my surprise, my transmission is ready to let go. Two Chrysler dealers in my area said they have never seen anything like this before and told me to contact Chrysler Canada and they might be able to bend the rules since this is a very rare incident and that my Jeep is such in good shape. Well, they pretty much slammed the door in my face. They will not do anything for me. I was going to trade her in for a new one this summer. Well I can tell you my mind has been changed. I will pay close to $2000 that it will cost me, but this will be the end of my Chrysler purchases forever.",0
"I have owned 3 Jeep Commanders 2006 and we have recently purchased a new Compass. I have decided to keep one of the Commanders. My family and myself have taken care of the Commanders from the beginning even though after the first year, the plastic door handles cracked and just fell out on the floor making it very hard to open the doors, we're always wondering when it will quit working. At first, I believed it was some fault of ours but after three 40,000 dollar cars and they all did the same thing, I decided to keep one and went to the dealership to pay and fix my own. They quoted me a price of $550.00 a piece, which is not fair as this is the third vehicle we have had to do this. I love these SUVs, but the doorknobs and the seat belts also will not hold up making it impossible to take all the kids at once. $330.00 a piece to fix the seat belts. There is a big manufacturing problem and I would like some help as we have purchased 4 Jeeps, 3 at one time.",0
"I am very disappointed in my purchase of a 2004 Jeep Liberty. After only 9 months, the engine and transmission went completely out. First, I had seals on the crankshaft start leaking and lots of noises from the tranny. Then all at once, the Jeep stopped working. I had it towed to a Jeep dealer here in Salt Lake City, and I was told it would cost me $4600.00 to have it repaired. Now, I read on Consumers Report that the Jeep Liberty is a death trap. From all the complaints, I think we should all get together and file a class action lawsuit against Jeep/Chrysler and get our monies back.",0
"While out of town on a road trip, my car stalled on the interstate and cut completely off. The inside lights would not work and the dashboard lights began to flicker. It restarted and I was able to pull over at a gas station. Once stopped, a burnt smell and smoke began to come from the gearshift inside the vehicle. 
      I was coming back from out of town and was 2 hours away from home. I was completely stranded with my family and was fortunate enough that the event we were at out of town had a charted bus and I was able to contact them and give us a ride home. Now, my car is 2 hours away from home and I am going to have to pay to get it towed to a dealership. This is completely and utterly dangerous! I looked up my symptoms and I have seen hundreds of complaints of the exact same things happening but no resolution from Chrysler or the dealerships. Consumers should not have to be responsible for manufacture’s defaults. At this point with the hundreds of complaints about the same issue, it is a default!",0
"At 68 miles, the check engine light came on. I returned to the dealer and was told the oxy sensor was bad, but it was okay to drive. At 300 miles, that did not work, and I ordered a computer and was told the car was okay to drive. At 1000 miles that also did not correct problem, so I left the car at the dealer. Two weeks, the car is still not fixed and Chrysler is not sure what will fix it. Customer Service keeps putting off the option to buy the car back. It is now 24 hours since I was last contacted by Jeep. They keep coming up with one more thing to put off resolving the problem. We bought a new Jeep Compass with 2 miles on it and have not had car for two of the 4 weeks we owned it. Even the dealer agrees that the car should be bought back.",0
"The Jeep was purchased in Utah where I have had nothing but problems from the beginning. It started with bad tire pressure sensor, then rear plastic window cracked, which is cracking again. Then a water leak started on soft top, which I have been to the dealer at least six times for them to replace seals and it still leaks worse today. Then the complete clutch and clutch release bearing went bad at 20,000 miles, which started to make noise again two months later and is going out again. Then the A/C didn't work, half doors flex out a half inch while driving on the freeway. They said it is normal. Then the front end rattles, the tailgate rattles loud and the traction control goes off for no reason on dry pavement, which makes the gas pedal unresponsive. It happened five times, then it knocks and pings abnormally, burns a quart of oil every 3000 miles. 
      The brake pedal clicks, then the rear brake pads completely wear out while the same time, the front brake pads have no wear at all. Then the zipper on the window doesn't work, stereo speakers make loud popping noise. Most of all these defects still are happening. The answer I got from traction control malfunction was ""life's a risk"". The answer I got for the front end noise was ""turn your radio up"". I have never had such a bad experience with a vehicle or unprofessional dealers in my life. I also want to mention how much of my time is spent at the dealer trying to get them to help me. I bought this vehicle brand new and I feel like I have been robbed.",0
"My wife was coming to pick me up. She got in the 2012 Jeep (Wrangler) and started it up, then put in reverse and then the jeep took like full speed and the parking brake was on. It went over the hill and slammed into the neighbor’s garage and the thing is my jeep had less than 2,000 miles and we only had it in a month.",0
I recently had to have ball joints and rods replaced in my 2008 Jeep Patriot with 43000 miles on the vehicle and finding out from several mechanics and forums that this is a very common problem with this vehicle. Chrysler/Jeep used inadequate parts with little regards to the buyers safety.,0
"After work, I was heading home. I was taking the off-ramp to exit the highway when I lost control of my TJ Jeep (2000 model). It spun around and the side of my Jeep hit the concrete medium. When I got out, I inspected what had happened and was missing my back right wheel. It got thrown/rolled about 100 feet further down and the wheel was completely intact with rim, undamaged tire and a portion of the rear axle still attached to it. The rear axle just snapped off. The car was in good condition and there was no reason for the axle to have given out like that.",0
"All four lift plates failed (between 2009-2011) on my Jeep 2006 Liberty and I had to have them replaced (lift plates broke and my windows would not stay up, I was required to repair the defective parts). I received a letter from Chrysler saying they had an extended warranty to cover the lift plates (no mileage restriction, good for 7 years from vehicle's in-service date) and that repairs were entitled to reimbursement. I submitted all of my receipts and required information to Chrysler. After much back and forth with the customer service reps from the Jeep customer assistance center, I was informed that they would not reimburse any of my costs associated with the lift plate repairs (total cost out of pocket for the four windows $717.85). No explanation was given as to why my claim was rejected despite my continued requests. My last request for a detailed explanation was filed about 2 weeks ago and I still don't have a response.",0
"Well, it started when I bought my 2007 Jeep Compass in 2006. Over the years, I have spent over $7k on ball joints (3 times), wheel hubs (2 times), struts, shocks and now transmission is going after 127,000. I have taken care of this vehicle (oil changes every 3k miles) and now it's going to cost me $3100 to replace an entire tranny. Jeep cannot help nor respond with any answers. There should be a serious recall on all 2007 Jeep Compass.",0
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty was rode off when the driver lost control and it went off the road and into a ditch and hit a brick barrier. The air bags did not deploy, as the impact was enough that the vehicle was unrepairable. I am disappointed knowing that there was a safety issue in that the air bags that are equipped to save lives did not deploy even though the vehicle hit front on. No one was hurt badly as a result but knowing that the one thing that we ensure when we buy our vehicles, that being safety was at risk, is certainly disappointing and could have been fatal.",0
"My husband and I purchased our ""Dream"" vehicle in 2009 and have had nothing but bad and dangerous experiences with the vehicle. It all started while driving on a very congested highway when the Jeep went over an uneven patch of road. It began to buck and lose control. We were shaken and scared, as my husband veered the vehicle to the right side of the highway. We made an appointment with our local dealer, and they found nothing wrong with the Jeep. 
      This happened a second time, and again, we took it to the dealer where this time, the tie rod was replaced and we were given four new tires and an extended warranty for our troubles. Months later, while driving yet again on the highway, the vehicle began to do the same thing--shake and convulse, and the brakes would not work properly. We have contacted Chrysler Corporation and have spoken to several employees who want us to continue taking the Jeep in for service, except one gentleman who basically told me to just deal with it! We believe Chrysler Corporation is very much aware of the problems with these vehicles and that they are just playing it off and ignoring the potential danger. We do not feel comfortable in trading this vehicle in and having someone else come after us and purchase this ""extremely dangerous"" vehicle. Is Chrysler Corp. waiting for us to become a statistic and our children having to file suit against them for our deaths? It is a shame that such a multi-million-dollar company does not take their customer complaints seriously and stand behind their products. But I guess, once the vehicles are sold, we are all on our own. We will continue to fight for what we feel is right morally, legally, and human!",0
"I bought a used 2006 Jeep Liberty just over a year ago.  It had 37,000 miles on it.  I had to have all the window regulators fixed at the dealership, which was covered under warranty.  The brakes squeak.  The back window clicks, and makes a noise every time you turn the car on.  It will not close correctly, unless you use the key pad to open the window.  A couple of months ago, my check engine light came on.  I took it to the dealer, to be scanned for trouble.  They told me it was something internal, $50.00 later.
      They wanted more money to dig into the problem.  I brought the car home.  My husband took some of the motor apart, only to find out that it was slugged.  We had to remanufacture the engine, and $1,000.00 later, we’re still having issues with the car.  The check engine light is still on.  The car runs rough at times, and sometimes it has an acceleration problem.  I had the car checked out again, and I am being told it is the PCM, which is still covered under warranty.  Trying to get a dealership to cover this, without being told that it is 12 other things for thousands of dollars.  I will never buy a Chrysler product again.  This is the worst piece of ** I have ever purchased.",0
"I pulled out of my parking spot while gently accelerating the gas pedal when my 2009 Jeep Liberty shot out of control. I attempted to break however, I was unable to stop the vehicle despite taking my foot off the gas pedal. As I was coming upon a busy intersection, I contemplated bailing out. Rather than doing so, I put the vehicle into neutral and pulled the emergency brake then turned the vehicle off. Once I was calm, I turned the vehicle back on, noting again unintended acceleration with the electronic throttle control light blinking. 
      I eventually had my car towed to a dealership where they said they need to replace the throttle plate but were uncertain why this occurred. I contacted Chrysler and told them the issue and my persistent apprehension in driving this vehicle again. They reassured me they would not release it if it was not safe to drive. Although I was unharmed, I fear that this vehicle is unsafe to drive. After reading numerous similar reports, I am appalled that situations such as this continue to occur with this make of vehicle.",0
"I have put a ton of money in my front end. Practicably rebuilt it, I'm not in any state to waste any more money. My brakes have been replaced about six times. I have only owned this jeep for about three years. I need answers right away on the recall parts please. My jeep Laredo is a 2000. Please help. I transport elderly around town and I'm nervous. I care about their safety. Thank you.",0
"After a 60,000 mile service, I drove from New England to Florida, 1560 miles. Gas mileage dropped from the usual 20-21 mpg to 16 mpg. I had the local dealer diagnose the cause. No problem they say. Updated the computer, otherwise all is gut. Now getting 13 mpg around town, 15 at steady speed (65) over 150 mi trips. Checked the computer read against manual mileage calculation. They agree. No smoke, steady, smooth idle, good engine response as usual. What the heck happened?",0
"Jeep Commander 2007 Stalling Problem for 4 Years: The Commander will start stalling 1st time after 30,000 work is completed. It will stall once every two weeks or so and escalate to several times a day. When I take it in for service, unless they can duplicate the issue, they make us take it back. So, we are, basically, driving it until it will stall daily. We have nearly (my wife and my daughter) been in two accidents due to the stalling, with cars coming at us in excess of 60 miles per hour. Eventually, we will get to the point that it will stall and all the lights will cut off and it will turn back on while driving on the highway at 55 miles per hour. We have filed 2 suits with Chrysler ** and **. They are this point putting the pressure on our service company, Prince Frederick, MD Jeep, and they have done everything they can. Chrysler is acting as if they have never heard of my situation and the danger they are putting my family in. 
      However, I can find investigations on my year and model on Consumer Affairs and USDT Investigation EA07-007 and PE07-009 as well as a ConsumerAffairs.com report dated 5/01/07 pertaining to this matter. We are so worried as what to do. I can not drive with my daughter and my husband drives all the way, too, into DC from Dunkirk, MD and I worry about his safety. I just want a safe vehicle for my family and they use us as there guinea pigs to drive until it is in a bad state and very frightening. We have lots of hills and people drive very fast in this area which makes it more frightening to stall. My daughter is too afraid to get in the Jeep and she cried last time we nearly were hit on our way to take her to school. Please help us. We don't want to trade it in so another family could be hurt and be in this situation or a teenager!",0
"My 2007 jeep commander wants to stall when starting off.  It remains locked at 35 mph, until I shift it to neutral, and back to drive.  The dealer cannot find the problem.  I fear that it will get me into an accident at some point.",0
"I financed a new 2007 Jeep Commander Sport. The first of many visits to the dealer was reinstalling the software. Then, we experienced on occasion, when all the gears on the panel lit up, and our truck wouldn't drive over 20 mph, which we recorded. I took it to the dealer, and never duplicated the error (software got updated). A couple of months later, the passenger speaker had a recall, and the dealer fixed it. A few months later, we noticed on cold days the idle would drop, as it was going to shut off. Also, on stops, the idle would go up, as my foot was on the break pedal. This got me worried. Once, a pedestrian walking in front of me thought I did it to scare them. I took it to the dealer. At this time, I knew the staff at Long Beach Chrysler Jeep personally, so they tried duplicating it. Of course, it wasn't. Months went by, everything was cool, I guess, then there was another recall on the side air bags. Before I go on, I forgot my wife was in involved in an accident, as she was leaving her parking spot. To get on the street, a driver clipped her tire, and pushed her forward six feet onto a parked Lexus. No airbags were deployed. They inspected something like the black box, and said she was traveling at a certain rate of speed to deploy. Whatever, my wife was at fault. The problem ended with the self idling after the last software upgrade.
      At 30,000 miles, I needed to service the transmission. I thought about taking it to a local shop. To my surprise, my truck didn't come equipped with a transmission dipstick. The dealer, or someone with the latest tool could only check it. At this time, I had moved to Bakersfield, so my choice was to take it to the local Jeep dealer. They noticed there was a leak on a seal. My warranty covered it, but had to pay a $200 deductible. It was smooth sailing, until my turning signaler started acting up in November. It was broken, so I had to replace it, and again, I had to pay a deductible.A month later, I noticed outside air coming in through the vents, but my fan cycle was off, and air was in recirculating mode, so no air should have been noticed. I took it in, in January 2012, to see if there was a recall, or maybe something got disconnected. The Bakersfield Jeep dealer would charge a diagnostic fee, and if the part was covered in warranty, they would waive it. They found the actuator needs to be replaced, and it's not covered by my warranty. They gave me a discounted quote for $850, but got me for my diagnostic fee. I knew it was a problem with the outside air coming in, so when I took it in, I told them it must be some kind of damper, that opens and closes like a door. Why couldn't the dealer tell me that only major AC components were covered, before they took my money. So now, my warranty is expiring, and I'm shopping for an extended warranty service outside the dealer. Since I have a pre-existing problem, a new warranty will not honor it. Unless it's another component that leads to that problem.Another issue I experienced about 2 years later after purchase, was my passenger mirror needed to be replaced. The long beach dealer fixed it. Prior to that, my gear shifter got stuck, and needed to be fixed. The dealer fixed it. Within the third year or so, I was living in the valley, and it gets hot. I turned the AC on, and a real foul muggy smell would come out of the vents. I took it to the dealer, and they had report that the condensate drain was plugged up. The dealer fixed it and even cleaned up my AC vents with some fancy spray. I'm finally going to be done paying it off in a few months, and have no plans of ever buying a Chrysler/Jeep vehicle. For what it's worth, now I think I'll have to buy an extended warranty elsewhere. I hope my issues get resolved with whatever service contract I purchase, and hope it's not the actuator that the dealer said was faulty. I'm not planning to get rid of it for now, I will drive it until years of newer warranties are expired.",0
"I write to you with deep dissatisfaction caused by my first impression of your service levels. I bought my car couple of months ago mid of December from your show room in Riyadh Dabbab Street. The first time I drove it, I noticed that the Forward Collision Warning was indicating that its not functioning in the computer screen located in the dashboard. The sales representative informed me that this might be a small programming issue that could be solved by visiting the servicing center in Khurais Street. During the first week of driving the car, I found out that the car also flags unnecessary breaking alarms on the computer screen. Also, the cruise control function gets disengaged within seconds of operation and driving.
      I visited your servicing center and a check was made where they found there is a defect in couple of parts that needed to be changed for the Radar and the Cruise Control functions to work. I was informed that the parts will be requested and in two weeks the parts will arrive and I will be contacted to bring my car to replace the parts and fix those two issues for both functions to operate.The fact that this was my first experience with a new car that had been bought and is considered the top of the Jeep Brand line was very disappointing. Usually, manufacturing defects surface within the first thousands of kilometers drive. In my case, it was the first seconds of driving the car out of the show room. However it gets worse...Although I was promised that I will receive a call in two weeks time, which never happened, I visited the servicing center for the second time approximately two weeks after not getting any update or the promised call. I was told that there is another part that still pending and needs to be ordered. I was requested to wait for another month. I expressed my dissatisfaction, knowing that such type of parts would not need more than two weeks to be ordered from the factory in the US if needed . I also suggested to the service manager to use DHL services and charge me the delivery fees if it's not within the UMC policy to request parts through international couriers. Two weeks is usually the normal experience with my other car parts ordering process where unavailable parts in the region would take maximum 15 days to be ordered from the factory. I was told that I could take my car back home and I will be called again when the second part will arrive. From my previous experience and the bad first impression I encountered, I refused and preferred leaving it to be serviced for other issues believing that the main old issue will be sorted as per my expectation.Two weeks now and my car still held with your servicing center without any update from your side. Today, I called your servicing center following up on the issues raised and again, I could not get any expectation or feedback as when the parts will arrive, replaced and my car can be delivered as I was expecting (fully functional) when I first bought it.I would kindly request you to review the circumstances of this compliant and find a reasonable solution that will insure a proper management of your customer's expectations is a key deliverable to promote the well known and respected Jeep Brand. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",0
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Patriot and the check engine was on.  I had it put into the purchase paper work that it need to be fixed upon my purchase.  I had my dad pull the code on it and it was a P2004 intake manifold stuck open.  
      I informed the dealer of the code and they said that they will get it fixed and they had to order the part.  The dealership had my Jeep for three days and when I got it back, the light was off but the next day, while driving home from work, the light came on again.  I again had my dad pull the code and he said P2004 intake manifold stuck open.  Upon further investigation of the engine, he also stated that there doesn't seem to have been any work done on the engine.  What can I do?  I cannot afford to put almost $1000 into a vehicle.  The dealership is being uncooperative as well.",0
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty brand new. It will be 5 yrs that I have had it in Dec. It has less than 60,000 miles on it and I have had so many problems with it. First off, the 1st yr was good. Then it just snowballed from there. A spring broke in the lifters; this was covered. Then my check engine light kept coming on. The car would stall. I was told it was an emissions problem. It cost nearly $500 to have it fixed. 
      Then the ABS light started coming on constantly. Starting the car up in the driveway, the ABS light would come on. Sitting still at a traffic light ,the ABS light would come on. I took it to the dealer to have it checked and told them exactly what I stated. I was told that they needed to know more. They didn't know why it was happening. Then this summer, my driver side window stopped working. I took it to the dealer and they told me, ""Oh, that's not covered. It's the window regulator, only the lifters are covered."" After fighting with Chrysler about this, they said if I paid 90 dollars, they would pay the rest. I did not get it right to the dealer. I come home one day and there is a message from Chrysler saying, ""Oh, that deal was only good for 30 days and you didn't get it done. so it's null and void.""At no time was I told there was a deadline on the deal. Yesterday, I went to move my car out of the drive so my husband can leave for work. As I put the car into park, there was a loud clicking noise. I went to turn the car off and the key didn't turn all the way and it's stuck in the ignition. I took it to the dealer and they tell me that the shifter cable is broken and ""no, it's not covered, it will cost me 330 dollars"". I bought a new car so I would not have the problems of a car ""nickel and dime-ing"" me all the time. Boy, did I get screwed. I have had better used cars that totally lasted a lot longer without breaking down.I am very angry that I have had to put all this money into this car. I really believe that this car has a lot of defects. I have read numerous complaints about people having problems with the windows, etc., yet nothing is being done. So what do I have to look forward to next? I just can't believe in the time that I have had this vehicle all that has gone wrong. I could maybe understand it if it were a lot older. I'm totally dissatisfied with Jeep and Chrysler for that matter. And it proves to me that the quality of the cars the are being putting out are way below standard. They say you pay for what you get. Well, I guess I pretty much paid for poor craftsmanship and a defective car.",0
There is a recall notice out there for those of you who have problems with your window regulator. My wife's sister had hers fail (2009 Jeep Liberty) and paid $450 to have it repaired. A recall notice was generated and she was paid for this repair. Check it out.,0
"Currently, new power train motor mount, car is stalling and stops. Chrysler changed my dealership. Antwerpen treated me poorly and sold a defective vehicle with rust and all. Currently, the car is at Tate in MD. All I'm asking for is an extended warranty. Many more parts have been changed. The trouble is that the dealership can't duplicate problems. They have to use on star. Even then, I  was told by Mr. ** that they can't duplicate problem. I have an extended history of service with the vehicle. It requires its own file box. I need assistance in order to obtain an extended warranty.",0
"While backing out of my usual parking space at the usual cautious pace, as I placed my foot on the brake, the Jeep (V8) suddenly chirped all four tires. Fortunately, I reacted by undoing what I just did, removed brake pressure (scary), then moved my foot left back onto the brake and stopped the vehicle. So, I've advised my wife to not drive the Jeep, and if any car suddenly accelerates, remove your foot and quickly replace it properly on the brake. Also, I advised her to slap the shifter into neutral and turn off the key. Remember, the Audi story years ago (we had one). The same situation happened. I got my foot partly on both the brake and accelerator and it chirped the front tires. In both cases when accelerating, there is less vacuum pressure due to the wide open throttle, so brake force is reduced, requiring many more pounds of force to stop. So, we need to remind our families that it's easy to do, and be ready to in due what you just did. By the way, now my Jeep lift gate is dented from car wash guys pushing the car from the wash line.",0
I have a 2011 Jeep Compass with 2.4 liter engine. The vehicle has 500 miles and we are only getting 7-10 miles/gallons in the city. I cannot get any assistance from the dealership. They just tell me to wait until summer and see if it improves. Anybody have some of the same problems?,0
"I just leased a 2012 Jeep Liberty. Jeep on their own website says that every radio system on the Jeep Liberty comes with Sirius XM radio and a 1-year subscription, as does the new car window sticker, and as did the salesman who leased me the vehicle. However, poking around all the channels on my new ""Sirius XM radio"", I find that there are channels missing. Upon deeper research, I find that I actually have a ""Sirius Select"" subscription, not a Sirius XM subscription as promised. And upon further checking I find that I cannot just upgrade my subscription on my own to get Sirius XM channels because Sirius XM requires a “different radio than is offered with the Jeep Liberty!”
      If Jeep had said, ""Our Sirius XM (the manufacturer) radios come with a free 1-year Sirius Select subscription,"" that would be one thing, but they did not. I have been on the phone with Sirius XM, and many times with the Jeep dealer and with Jeep corporate. Today the Jeep sales manager called me and basically said, ""Sorry but we are not liable for that."" The assigned Jeep case worker told me first that they would give me free oil changes. When I insisted they keep their word and give me Sirius XM radio as promised, she then came back and said they would cover half of the cost of the Sirius XM radio. If they aren't responsible, why would they do that? When I tried to nail the case manager down about exactly how much that is and if that included the subscription, she said she didn't know. Obviously she is going back and forth with the dealership, which is not owned by Jeep but is an independent dealer. I also looked into getting Sirius XM internet radio, but again that still does not have the XM stations I want, so I can't cover this on my own without spending hundreds. But I shouldn't have to do that anyway. The issue isn't just a few channels. The issue is that Jeep is not providing something that is promised and is listed on the sales receipt. I don't want to make a huge deal about this. All I want is what I was promised. How about it, Jeep?",0
"For the second time in less than 2 years my rear window regulator broke. First time it cost me $350.00. Now they want another $170.00 to fix it, plus it cost me $65.00 for them to tell me what was wrong with it. I told them to tape it up and forget it. I am not working at this time and cannot afford the company's incompetence. I cannot believe that with so many complaints on this that the company has not recalled this defective component in their vehicles. Am I angry? You bet. I am looking for a different vehicle today, forget them. I loved my vehicle but cannot afford this problem every time I turn around.",0
"The dealer was called and he told us that we were 129th on the list for a speaker transformer. The right side of the vehicle has no sound. After inspection we were told that the speaker needed a transformer. I called a dealer in Florida when the date the transformer was supposed to arrive here came and went. We were supposed to have it by January 24. After speaking to Florida I was told that they didn't know if any were going to be coming in because they didn’t have a supplier. So they sell you dead equipment and they can't replace it. We have so much trouble with this Jeep. The motor has been replaced, plus the transmission, the heater blower, the seat heater and the list goes on and on.",0
"I started my 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport to warm it up and after 10 minutes, the gas tank exploded. If you have one, I would sell it now before this happens to you. I will never buy a car with the Jeep name ever again! If my family would have been in it, I would have Jeep's ** right now. They should really be investigated for faulty manufacturing as I hear more and more horrible things are happening to almost every model of Jeep that is out right now.",0
"My mom had purchased a brand new 2003 Jeep Liberty sport in 2003. Everything was good with the car for a while except it idled high and then the fan went out. When we had that replaced, the ABS light came on and really has never turned off. The mechanic had unplugged wires and messed with fuses, but it never was fixed. There also was a recall on the lower ball joints, which took forever for the dealership to send to us. Now here is the interesting part, we live in a remote area of Alaska and it does get cold. Last Wednesday, I went out and started the jeep and it ran about 10 minutes before we heard this loud boom in our house. I looked outside and the car had blown up and was on fire back by the gas tank. The car is a complete loss, the whole inside was burnt to hell, there was nothing left. The fire department said the case was an equipment malfunction. They think either the gas line or tank froze and then cracked or something. I have read online about the gas tank problems other Liberty owners have had and that is really scary. I am just thankful no one was in the car and no one was hurt.",0
"I would like to let it be known that Jeep compass is very unsafe. I went for an oil change to find out my steering wheel is ready to go out of control. The Jeep is bought on 2008 and only driven to and from work. The local driver said it’s loose and want to charge me over $1,000 to fix not only that has terrible blind spot which is unsafe. I had a Caviler for 13 years and never had something like that happen. There should be a manufacture recall.",0
"I took my 04 jeep in for oil leaks from front and rear oil seals. They removed the transmission. Now, the transmission shifts wrong and hard. Also, transmission has a hard time engaging and disengaging. Also, my windows and door locks don’t work again. I put the Jeep up on a rack and found the transmission vent tube hanging torn ground wires that were not disconnected when transmission was removed along with missing tarns oil pan bolts. All this so-called work was done by the Jeep dealer in Hilo, Hawaii.",0
"I own a 2006 Jeep Liberty that I purchased new. I had several problems with the window regulators breaking and the windows falling down or failing to roll back up. The first few times these were replaced under warranty. After my warranty expired, my back two windows broke and fell down. I called to find out what this would cost and was told about $400 per window. I did not have nearly $900 to shell out to have this fixed when there is an obvious problem with these windows in this model year. 
      Last year, I found out Jeep decided to extend the warranty on these windows for model years 2006-2007 for 7 years. I called my dealer to find out about this warranty and was asked for my Vin number, they ran the number and told me my car did not qualify as it was past the cut off month - mine built in March '06 and they said it was for anything after May '06 and later. The letter says nothing about this! They said I could have them fixed and pay for it and then try to get my money back from Chrysler Jeep. I am a single mother and don't have that kind of money to get these fixed for a problem that Jeep is very aware of! This is very unsafe as your car can easily be broken into if the window starts to fall. All someone has to do is push down, reach in and open the car. I currently have wedges stuck in between the glass and door to try and keep these up. It is ridiculous. I can't use my windows and I will never be able to sell this car or trade it in with this problem not fixed. The cost is too expensive that no one else will want to pay to have it done. I am stuck with this car that was poorly designed that Jeep is very aware of and now will do nothing about it.",0
"I have a 2008 Jeep Patriot and my car continues to stall. While driving down the highway with my baby, a 2-year old, the call stalled and I had to use the momentum from before hand to steer over to the emergency lane. Upset and shaken, I called to tell my fiance because all this began after having a routine oil change just four days earlier with only one day of driving in between.
      In either case, I'm in the emergency lane just moments before a possible rear ending. The car now parked and turned off. I waited five minutes before restarting it. As soon as the car was able (meaning it kept stalling within same day), I took it back to the dealership. They told me the oil is fine and that now my check engine light and oil indicator light is on. I'm baffled. It wasn't before. They asked me to pay them over $400 to diagnose and perform preventive services that weren't needed prior to them changing my oil.I left with intention of contacting corporate FTC (1-877-) and NHTSA (1-888-). To my distress, these events happened four more times before I made it home. My home is a five-minute drive from the dealer. I am petrified to drive it. I am so scared that if and when it happens again, I won't be able to get to safety before something horrific happens. As I read similar complaints to that of my own, I see that Jeep has made this a recall issue for Cherokees and Compass only and that is what baffles me. If this issue is occurring with Patriots as well with different year makes and nationwide, isn't that at least worth looking into considering the safety issues it poses?",0
"I have a new 2011 Jeep Patriot. The car does not even have 2K miles on and the brakes squeal. The dealer has already replaced the brakes, and the problem continues. It's been a week, and the dealer is still waiting to hear back from Jeep. I guess my life is not important to Jeep.",0
"Let it be known that the life of an importer of Jeep Liberty CRDs to Canada is humiliated into a great deal of time wasting trouble. Dealers in my city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada don't like importers. They call us “curbers.” A bad word. The Chrysler service departments don't like the Liberty CRD. The latest problem is when I must go to my local dealer to get the daytime running lights activated. DRLs are mandatory to satisfy the Canadian Auto Registrar.
      Dealers charge $90 for the Canadian module and they charge $90 to activate the module, which looks like a relay that goes into the left hand side dash fuse box. The US module plugs right in beside the Canadian one and when the programming is finished you unplug the US relay module. (It buzzes if you leave it in). Today the dealer took my CRD into their shop. I signed the waiver and in a half hour I get a call that they cannot get their computer to get into the Liberty’s computer. This means no DRL and no to any updates. I got back into my CRD and noticed the air bag light was on. I tried plugging the US module back in and also tried disconnecting the battery for reset.Nothing works. Dodge City service department Saskatoon, SK is stating no responsibility and will not hook their computer up to my ECU unless I agree to at least $2,000 minimum work order. The Jeep CRD and a Canadian importer are victims.",0
"I have a 2007 Jeep Commander. I went to drive it today, and again, it would not start. The car has had its battery replaced already, and this has happened a couple of times since I've owned it. I have had many ""electrical quirks"" such as lights blinking and going off. It also has completely turned off on the turnpike on a hill. There was no power in the vehicle, and the left lane traffic is extremely dangerous. The jeep does frequently lurch forward when at a stop, when the engine is still running. I keep looking for recalls, and found none, but others I know with Commanders have had the same issues. How many complaints, before they are made to fix the problems at their cost, not mine?",0
I had an accident on 1/4/12 where I hit another vehicle going 35 mph. My vehicle was imbedded in the back end of the vehicle I hit. My air bags didn't go off and I was told that it was due to the deceleration of the vehicle. I never even had a chance to hit the breaks. The man I spoke with at Chrylser was rude and condescending. I would like to think that if I buy a vehicle with air bags that they would work if I needed them. I do not feel the least bit safe with the thought of having to drive around in this vehicle especially with my children.,0
"I engaged the 4 wheel drive on my 05 Jeep Liberty Sport edition, which is an automatic, and now, while in 2 Hi, the ""Part Time"" indicator light is on, albeit the vehicle is obviously in 2 wheel drive, I can tell it is no longer in 4 Hi or 4 Lo. And when I engage 4 Hi or 4 Lo, the indicator turns off. 
      Any ideas what the issue might be? Is it the Powertrain Control Module? Is it the Transfer Case Position Sensor, or harness? And can I work on it from underneath the vehicle? I have done my research both locally and online, and I have found multiple forums with patrons posing the same problem I have.",1
"I bought a 2004 Jeep Liberty (used) with 30,000 miles on it. The first year, I had to replace the transfer case. Next came the PCM computer, not counting the endless times I had to replace so many sensors. I live in the city where these jeeps are built. I will never buy another Chrysler product.",0
"I have a 2006 Jeep Commander. Everything from leaking grab bars to the brake system is broken. The door handles busted out. The grab bars leak every time it rains or you wash the car. You can be driving and all the dash lights come on but it has died while driving on interstate 75 at 70mph. stalls at lights, stop signs, esp. bas lights come on. The smell from the wet carpet and floor when it leaks is unbearable. When questioned the dealer about mold, the response was no way this car is built to last and withstand the wet. Dealer had the vehicle from Sept 14 to Jan 7 and only replaced door handles at my cost. This car is a safety hazard and I am afraid to drive it. It only has 67k miles on it.",0
"How many people have to report that Jeep products have engines that are defective and are ruined by the valve seat dropping?! We just spent $4000.00 on a 2002 Liberty and the dealership said, ""Hey we fixed those valves in the new one."" Well how does that help all of us that got stuck with the old engine? The rings were made with powdered metal that ends up shattering. Please look into how often this happens. Jeep should reimburse people.",0
"I am writing seeking help. I have failed to receive any acceptable resolution to my problem. Please see below my submission to the NHTSA. Please contact me at any time so we can reach a quick and mutual resolution.
      The rear window regulators in the 06 Jeep Liberty are failing at an alarming rate. Ours has had both break once and the drives side twice now. I have contacted Jeep with my frustrations with zero help. There are countless claims online, with friends, acquaintances, and even my local jeep dealer (Easton, MD) that all support that this is not an isolated issue.I have again been told that there will be no recall because this is not a safety issue. I disagree strongly! When driving down the highway and the window regulator fails, the window drops. What happens if there is something leaning up against the window, a child in that seat, a pet? The risks are huge to the safety of the vehicle occupants and others on the road should something fall out.The other thing that is very alarming is that everything is beginning to present itself at a similar time for the vehicles showing signs of the problem. Jeep claims it is due to plastic parts failing due to not enough use? This makes no sense. The rear window has no support and falls inside the window. It is currently held up with packing tape.To support my claim that this is an issue affecting a large number of people and clearly not an isolated issue, please see the web sites listed below.",0
"2005 Jeep Liberty 3.7L: Both rear windows fall down.  The regulator goes out.  I spoke to several mechanics.  It happens all the time to 2005-2006 and 2007's.  This is not a recall item on Jeep’s website.  On Jeep forum, one consumer said ""Bad regulator, not a safety issue, so no recall.”  If this is what Jeep/Chrysler told him/them, this is just wrong.  Why would they put a lock on the rear window and a child safety lock on the rear door if not for ""safety""?  There are hundreds of forums with thousands of complaints about the Jeep rear window regulators.  Jeep should have a recall notice for these vehicles.  And if they will not repair, at least they should permanently fix so that they do not operate and just stay up.",0
"Jeep Liberty 2004. After replacing a battery a week ago, I had a stall problem. I mentioned the battery because of a noise I heard before it died that I did not take much noise in but relates to the stall I had this week. I was coming home from work in congested traffic and started hearing a ""whirring"" noise. I heard it several times and noticed it was coming from my dash. This is also when I noticed the dash lights (radio and odometer lights were flickering). I also noticed a slight lose of power. As I came up to a light and stopped, the Jeep stalled. I quickly pushed the hazard lights, put it in park and restarted it. No problems since. I am concerned about driving it. What if I had been driving and not stopping at a light? I was in bumper to bumper traffic.",0
"I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty that I bought used in August of 2009 with only 16,000 miles on it. One month after I purchased my Jeep, the front passenger window regulator went out. I got online to see about the cost of repair and found out about this widespread problem. I couldn't afford to pay for the repair so I had to tape the window up. In April of 2010, the rear drivers side window went out, so I taped it up. Yesterday, the rear passengers side window went out and now I am fed up. 
      I called Chrysler Corporate (800-xxx-xxxx) today and complained that I now have three windows that do not work and do not have the money to fix them and I'm driving around with taped up windows. I told them that I know for a fact that this is a widespread problem and I know that the regulators are made of cheap plastic that will not hold up to the repetitive motion of windows being rolled up and down. The customer service lady then asked, ""What is it that you are asking Chrysler to do?"" and I said, ""You are going to fix my windows. This is a serious security problem as someone could easily break into my car."" After she asked me a bunch of questions and put me on hold several times, she then came back and said they were going to expedite the problem and give me a case number and have someone call me. I hope they follow through and actually make the repairs. I will throw a fit if they try and make me pay one penny. I will not do it!",0
"I have a 2007 pre-owned certified Jeep Liberty under 80,000 miles. My car wouldn't start so I had it towed to the dealership. I was informed that there was a rod in the steering column that attached to the ignition that shirred off. The part is backordered on 398 vehicles and there are none being made. How is this acceptable? Chrysler needs to support their vehicles! I am without a car. My car is my office on wheels. My car is now sitting at a dealership and I am paying about $80 a day for a rental! This for a 2007 car! Chrysler needs to do something about this!",0
"It's a 2007 Jeep Compass with 42,000 miles. This has been the worst car ever! This will make the second time the clutch is failing, both times within less than 12k miles and a little over a year. First time it happened I knew it could have not been my driving ( I never had issues with clutches before and I bought it brand new). The dealer replaced the t/o bearing and clutch plate. The dealer was in shock because they had no clue what caused the clutch and bearing to shatter.Now I am at a second time, out of 3/36 warranty and I am ** because the dealer did not know what the root cause of my problem was. The sad part is that this is not the only problem with the car. It has had multiple issues that the dealer can never catch it doing. I mean it is awesome when it decides not to start. No battery click, no starter engaging, no cranking, nothing. Then 10 mins later, oh it starts fine.",0
"My jeep would not start when I went to go start my 2005 Jeep Liberty. Jeep would not start. I brought it into a jeep dealership and was informed that a piece on the steering column broke off, and that this is a common thing with this jeep. I am told I need to replace the whole steering column. When we went to go order the column, and we discovered that 400 people are waiting for this steering column.
      As of 12/28/2011, these 400 people are all on a waiting list for this part that is back-ordered. I am wondering why there has not been a recall on this steering colomn. I am without a vehicle for I don't know how long.",0
"I contacted the two listed below back in November 2010. Both locations asked if I bought the vehicle from them. I told them no and they told me they could not help me. I was told the same thing by Bob Baker Jeep in Carlsbad, CA.
      Why is it that none of these dealers have any interest at all in helping a Jeep customer? Do you have the address for the corporate office where I can send a formal complaint?",0
"I purchased my 2004 Jeep Liberty in 2006. I have been lucky not to have any problems until three months ago when the rear driver's side window unexpectedly fell. After doing some research (and holding it up with duct tape), I have found out that I cannot simply purchase the regulator slider that is faulty but I have to purchase an entire new motor and regulator with a new window since Jeep has redesigned said parts after finding out their previous design was faulty. I can aptly fix the problem myself but cannot purchase the single part because Jeep no longer allows selling it. This is absurd and a recall should definitely have been issued. I will never buy Chrysler again.",0
"My wife and I bought a 08 Commander three months ago.  When taking it to my mechanic to have an oil change performed, he saw a leak coming from the engine block.  I contacted Chrysler and was told to take it to a dealership to have them diagnose the issue to see if they could help cover it.  The dealership found a crankshaft seal leaking which I have replaced at the time, granted the vehicle only has 30,000 miles on it.  Chrysler informed me that they cannot cover it because they can’t tell if it was pre existing when we bought it or not.  
      I will definitely remember this when my 05 Ram and Jeep need to be replaced when I find a different make to buy.  They fail to realize that the main issue is that stuff is failing in the engine and transmissions of all their vehicles with low miles.  The US tax payers helped bail the auto industry out and they can’t help the people who purchase their vehicles by backing up what they sell.",0
"I bought a certified pre-owned 2007 Jeep Patriot with 17,000 miles on it in April 2008. Within two years and low miles, we had to replace both ball joints and now the entire transmission. I have since done research—shame on you Jeep Chrysler. And shame on the government for not forcing a recall on these matters. First of all, bad ball joints can cause accidents. Second, how often does an automatic transmission go out after four years? We have kept up on all the maintenance and never abused our vehicles. I just can't believe there are so many people out there with the same problems as I. No wonder the car industry is going bankrupt; they won't stand by their product. In these days and times, a person can barely afford to buy a vehicle let alone put out for such costly repairs.",0
"My 2004 Jeep Liberty keeps stalling. While driving, the jeep stalled and would not become idle.  This was right in the middle of a busy intersection, with our kids in the jeep.  We were told by a Jeep dealership that the engine computer has shorted out, and needs to be replaced.  The cost is $1,100.00.  They do not offer a new computer, only a rebuilt one that is available through the dealer.",1
"I ordered a 2012 Jeep Liberty Jet from the factory.  The engine ticks loudly, while in idle, and never stops.  At 50-60mph, the engine shudders, vibrates and has a roar to it, sounding and feeling like the wedges you go over, to slow your vehicle down.  It has 700 miles, and these are from going to the dealerships, and independent mechanics. 3 dealership trips, and 2 trips to independent mechanics.  Chrysler refused to do anything about it.",0
"I own a 2006 Jeep Commander, that I bought new. I have all of my receipts for everything, my truck has been well maintained, except for the fact that it has leaked since the beginning. I have had it serviced 7 times for the leak, and yet, I have a huge puddle in my passenger area, yet again. I don't know if there is mold in it, but they assure me that there isn't. I cant be sure. The car has also stalled for no reason several times. They can't explain that either. I don't know what to do with this truck. I have spent a small fortune getting it fixed over and over again, for the same problems.",0
"I have a 2006 jeep commander. I bought it 2 years old from dealership. I am experiencing a problem. When I go through the smallest of puddles, my belt must slip and I lose my ability to steer properly. Like having to power steering. I have brought it to my mechanic and have now brought it to jeep. No one not even jeep knows how to fix this. There has been references made to an undercarriage shield, yet jeep says my car doesn't have one made for it. The service department told me to avoid going through puddles at all costs. Do you know how impossible that is when it rains. So I have a Jeep Commander and I can't go through puddles.",0
"We have a 2008 Jeep Patriot and it was purchased new.  Within the first year, our sunroof started leaking.  We took the car to the dealership three to four times before they finally replaced the seal on it.  They kept saying they were bugs or leaves in the tracks.  It wasn't until I threatened to get a lawyer that they replaced the seal.  Our liner has spots on it from the water damage and the mechanic's hands.  We have now owned our car for three and a half years.  It has 46,000 miles.  This last month, it has started leaking again!
      We noticed water on the passenger side flooring (a puddle) and could not find water anywhere else.  After looking online, I thought it was possibly a clogged hose from the defrost.  We took the car to a mechanic who has confirmed that it would not be a problem and suggested that we go to a body repair specialist to find where the leak is coming from.  After looking at the car and the large puddle in our car, it looks like it is coming from somewhere around the rear window.  I have called Jeep and the assigned case manager will not commit to fixing it.  They want us to pay the dealership to look at it and then they may possibly allow us to have a copay to repair this.  How can they get by with this?  It appears that this is a common problem.  We feel that our car is ruined!  You can hear water under the floor!  Help!",0
"2003 Jeep Liberty Freedom Edition (original owner). 
      I have replaced the motor on my left rear window on three separate occasions. The first time was covered under warranty, but it was out of pocket the second and third time. It's expensive and apparently a consistent problem with other Jeep Liberty owners. According to the dealership in Davis, this part has not been recalled.With the first use of my car for the day, a metal grinding sound occurs when I brake (lasts for about 3-4 brake uses and then goes away). It's very loud and embarrassing, though I was assured that my life is not in danger. I was told that this is due to debris from the elements (air, dirt, etc.). I am the original owner of this Jeep Liberty and this has never happened in 8 years, until now.From a standstill and then pressing the gas pedal to drive my automatic Jeep, my car jerks (I can feel it and hear it) as if I were driving a stick shift car in the wrong gear. Dealer does not know why.My car has turned off three times when I stop at a red light (stop light, etc.) and I have to restart the Jeep. Sometime it turns on. Other times, I wait and then try again and it turned on. I just took it to the dealer where I was charged a hefty diagnostic fee. However, they could not tell me what the problem was. I am paying a fee, yet they can't determine the problem for my car turning off while I am in moving traffic.Does anyone know if it is ""legal"" to charge a diagnostic fee when the dealership can't determine the problem? I would accept the fee if they were addressing the problem; however, they are not.",0
"I purchase a brand new 2009 Jeep Liberty in August 2009 from Manhattan Jeep in New York City with the understanding that there was at 36,000-mile bumper to bumper warranty and an unlimited powertrain warranty. As per the warranty, I had my service routinely done at Riverdale Jeep in Bronx, NY. At 34,000 miles at 10:00 pm while on the NJ Turnpike with my 3-year-old son in the car, my car started overheating. I pulled over, popped the hood and smelled radiator fluid. I looked at the bottom of car and noticed radiator fluid dripping from under the car. I thought I had a radiator leak. 
      I called my husband and he brought me radiator fluid, we put in the radiator fluid and the car turned on, it was not overheating so we attempted to drive home (to be looked at in the morning at jeep). The car started overheating again, I pulled over in the gas station re-popped the hood brought more radiator fluid poured it in and noticed it pour out of the bottom of car. There was a mechanic who looked at car and noticed the water pump was totally broken. The mechanic indicated that this should not happen until about 100,000 miles. The car was towed to Little Ferry Jeep and they called me stating that the water pump was broken and that there was engine damage due to the broken pump but that they were voiding the warranty. I told them not to touch my vehicle and called a tow have my vehicle brought to my Riverdale Jeep dealer where I do my services.Little Falls Jeep changed the water pump without my permission and left a warranty hold on the engine damage that was directly caused as a result of the broken water pump as per Riverdale Jeep. Riverdale jeep was unable (even though they indicated that it should be covered) to cover under warranty due to Little Ferry changing the water pump and putting a void on my engine repair. Sonny, the mechanic at Riverdale Jeep in Bronx, NY explained to me that the engine damage is a direct result of the broken water pump that Little Falls took out of my vehicle without my permission. Sonny also indicated that since the water pump was totally broken, none of the coolant would have gotten to the engine and that the overheat light or sensor would not have told me this until a couple of minutes and that is why I have engine damage. Three cylinders need to be replaced, not the total engine as Little Falls would have led me to believe.Now I am paying $3,300 to Riverdale to fix damages to my engine that resulted from the defective water pump which all should have been covered under the lifetime powertrain warranty. The car is less than 2 yrs old. I want the $3,300 back and my powertrain warranty re-instated as per the purchase agreement.",0
"The Jeep Liberty 2.8L CRD has a flaw in its design.  The EGR valve is a high failure item in the 2.8 CRD.  One of the modes is set to ""fail ope"", with no accompanying ""Check Eng"" light.  When the EGR fails open, unregulated air flows into the intercooler, causing complete failure, and then allowing the turbo to receive unregulated air, leading to its failure.  This all happened in less then 3 miles last week, on my 2006 Jeep Liberty 2.8 CRD with 87,000 miles on it. $5,200 later the car is running, but what a bill for a poor design, with no bypass line. For wanting a $150 EGR valve, the motor was lost.",0
"I bought my 2007 Jeep Patriot brand new. About a year later, my jeep stalled at a light. It was raining and started right away so I figured maybe some water had gotten into a hose or the engine. It didn't stall after that for another year. Since then, it stalls every time it rains! I am so fed up with Jeep not recalling their vehicles for known issues. It seems like someone has to die and a lawsuit has to be filed before they do anything to fix their problems. I am so tired of having to invest money in this car.
      At around 60, 000 miles, I had to replace both ball joints. Even with an alignment my car still vibrates at high speeds. The transmission struggles when accelerating. I've had to replace all my rotors! My driver side window squeals as it is rolled up. There was a mysterious leak thru my trunk that resulted in water being accumulated where the spare tire is. Took it the dealership and they replaced the rubber gasket but the damage was already done. I service my SUV regularly so I wouldn't expect so many problems. I use fuel injection additives to make sure the fuel system is clean. I change my spark plugs on time. I never had this much problems with my 2000 Galant.",0
"My wife went to an automated car wash.  When the wash was done, she put the Jeep in drive and the vehicle took off on its own.  She could not get the Jeep to slow down at all.  Using all her force on the brake, she could not slow the vehicle down.  She ended up flipping the Jeep several times, totaling the vehicle.  Thank God there were no pedestrians or other vehicles involved.  She was lucky that she was not killed.  She has several broken ribs and lacerations and was badly bruised.  She’s never been in such pain.  I think that Chrysler needs to look at this situation very closely.  It also seems that the government should be stepping in also seeing how many of these incidents have now happened.  Could someone please help us with this on whom to contact about this?",1
"The wiring that goes to all the lights are up under the dash near the brake pedal. After driving the jeep for some time, all of a sudden the lights quit working. After having it checked, the brake pedal had rubbed against the wiring and rubbed them until they completely came apart losing all connection. Therefore, the lights, signals and everything quit working. I had it repaired, but still the lights only work part of the time. The mechanic at the Dodge place told us it was a wonder it had not caught on fire.",0
"I have a 2007 Jeep Liberty with a 3.7 engine. Last month, I had to put in over 1800.00 in engine repair because of carbon build up on the cylinders and valves. Since the time of this repair, I have been digging into this issue and have found out that Jeep is aware of this problem but has chosen not to address it. Searching the internet has produced numerous instances of the same issue I am having. I have also talked with the people at the local Jeep dealership. They also admit (unofficially) that there is a problem and my Jeep is one of many that this issue has and is happening. If you are having or have had this issue also please send me an e-mail",0
"I purchased a 2002 Jeep Liberty in April, and I have really enjoyed it until recently. It only has 73,000 miles on it. And one day I was leaving work and heard a clunk sound. When I got home, I opened the hood and checked the oil. It was completely gone, and it was less than 3000 miles since it's last change. It started to make a rattle sound, and so I took it to two different mechanics, one Chrysler and was told the entire engine needs to be replaced. I had refilled the oil and haven't lost any since, and now I find out that this has happened to many people and Chrysler replaced the engine and model and is not helping those that need the repair done.",0
"Ok, I have a few gripes and one really weird scenario for ya. I too have replaced the window motors on each door several times and have the problem code referring to the emission leak that cannot be found on a 2003 JGC. But the weird thing that happened was that my wife walked up to what she thought was her car and unlocked it with the key fob, and when she got it open, she realized that this was someone else’s car. 
      The alarm went off when she opened the door and she could not turn it off using her key fob. Now her remote will not open her car either. Funny, huh? So for the guy near Charlotte, NC with SC tags, that's why your remote doesn't work now! The car still works fine and I think I can reprogram the alarm system even if I have to take it to the dealer. Strange that we could unlock that guy's car though. I know there are a finite amount of codes to go around, but what are the odds? I'm lucky that mine works still.",0
"This is about the 2006 Jeep Liberty recall of heater/AC blower motor.  The recall was performed and the motor was replaced.  After replacement, the # 1 and # 2 speed fans/blowers were no longer operable.  I contacted the dealer who replaced blower motor.  I was told this often happens after blower motor is replaced as resistor blows.  It is not covered under warranty or recall, even though the direct cause was due to recall replacement of blower motor.  The estimated cost will be $150-$200 to repair.",0

"I bought a 2008 Jeep Liberty. I purchased it off of the used car lot, however, it only had approximately 3,000 miles on it and had never been previously owned. I have been having problems with my driver's side window not being able to go down most of the time. Although when I did get it down, it would always go up. Finally, it stopped altogether and the switch actually broke off completely. I spoke with a person at a Jeep dealership about this. He quoted me a price for the part then let me speak with the labor department. When I spoke with them regarding the labor, the man did not have to look up the price. He knew right away down to dollars and cents. After reading about the same problem over and over, it seems like this is obviously a defect on Chrysler's part and this needs to be recalled.",0
"I bought a 2008 Jeep Liberty and took it home for one day--it had multiple issues. The stability control was messed up and so was the brake assist. I couldn't even drive it. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. I took it back before the financing even went through. For vehicles priced this high, there shouldn't be issues. My credit took a hit because they sent it through so many companies all at once for a vehicle. I will never buy a jeep!",0
"The steering wheel of our new Jeep Liberty is too thick to get my very small hands around. It is also made of a smooth material. This is a bad design.

"While driving down the freeway in the left lane, about to pass a tractor/trailer and another vehicle plus a tractor/trailer directly behind me, my '05 Jeep Liberty suddenly fully accelerated. As soon as I passed the T/T, I cut to the right and on to the shoulder of the road while breaking and turned off the key. Once my heart stopped racing, I turned the key to the on position and noticed a new warning light. The ""Electronic Throttle Control"" according to my owner's manual. After about 5-10 minutes, I tried starting it again but it immediately started revving into the stratosphere, so I shut it off and called a tow truck. The next day, my husband went out and it started up fine but he isn't going to run it until it's fixed.",1
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Liberty in 2010. The first problem was with the windows. They keep coming off-track. After months of dealing with Orr Honda in Texarkana, AR, they said they were finally fixed by replacing the regulators or something like that in each of them. Less than 6 months later, the rear driver side went out. They said that I had just ran out of warranty and it would be $330.00. Then, the driver side window went out and today, the passenger window went out. I cannot afford all of these window problem. I have had people come up to me and say, ""have your windows gone out yet?"" Or say, ""I see your windows are wedged, I had to keep mine that way until I got rid of it"". Is there somewhere I can turn to with the company?",0
"I bought a brand new 2011 Patriot with only 5 miles on it in Feb. 2011. Before my first oil change, I had started having problems. On two separate occasions, I heard an unexplained noise almost as if my ball joint had broken and my wheel was about to fall off. The first time, it only happened for a few seconds, the second time I pulled over, nothing seemed wrong. When I got back in it, it drove fine. Of course the dealer couldn't do anything because there was not a malfunction light on. 
      Since then, the problems keep coming. There is a dead spot when accelerating around 50mph, I then have to mash the gas to get it past it. The transmission feels weak; the dealer won't do anything until it breaks. Then I just noticed the other day my door hinge has begun rusting already. I would expect it after about two years but not 8 months. Jeep has gone to hell since Chrysler bought them in the late 80's. I knew I should have bought a GM.",0
"My 2009 Jeep Patriot stalls out in traffic. Sometimes at a stop, sometimes on the freeway at 60mph. In July 2011, I drove this Patriot, which I have had complete confidence in since my purchase two years previous, to Los Angeles. While there, the Jeep stalled out and I was unable to start it again. I had it towed to the Chrysler dealership in Glendale. The gentleman who helped me in the service department got my Jeep in and repaired in mere hours. Originally they charged me $100 deductible against the warranty I purchased when I got the car. That same afternoon, the dealer called and said that charge had been a mistake and that they would be sending me a check, which they did.
      Less than two weeks later, however, I was in San Diego and the Patriot started stalling on me again. Rather than have it towed I was able to drive it into the dealer, though it stalled multiple times on the way. They had the car for three days and in the end, replaced the computer. They charged me the $100 deductible again, which I was fine with since the last dealer was reimbursing me. The Patriot drove fine for a few more weeks, all the way back to my home in Texas where it ended up parked for about two weeks without being driven. Then, when I was going to drive it, it wouldn't start. It seemed to be the exact same issue. In Texas I had it towed to the original dealer I'd purchased it from - Lone Star Chrysler in Cleburne. Their service department, knowing that I was soon to depart for California again for school, was attentive and though they admitted that they couldn't get the Patriot to do the same thing, they said they'd narrowed it down to two things - one being the ignition (I remember this because I had to bring my second key to them for programming). They also charged me the $100 deductible against my warranty.Two weeks later I'm back in San Diego where I am attending ministry school. The Patriot stalled out on me one evening on the way back to neighboring El Cajon, where I am living. The next day I was able to drive it into San Diego proper and to class. That afternoon I dropped it back to Midway Chrysler - the dealership that had worked on the Patriot previously. Midway Chrysler had the Patriot for two weeks, leaving me without a vehicle. They have repaired the Patriot but have wanted me to pay the $100 deductible before picking it up, which I am both economically unable to do and ethically just not comfortable doing.How long will Chrysler steal the warranty deductible from me for a problem on their car that they made? This car is an accident waiting to happen - a deathtrap. Stalling in the road can and will eventually lead to an accident that will not only inconvenience people but could possibly take someone's life. I've called the Chrysler warranty number. They have told me to continue working with the dealer. I called the dealer in Texas and they originally said that if I could get the car back to Texas that they would buy the Patriot back. I'd be willing to do that at the risk of having to drive the car another 1,500 miles, but after a weekend they changed their mind. Lone Star Chrysler in Cleburne, Texas did not want to buy back the Patriot, nor have they had any interest in helping me.",0
"I bought a Jeep Commander three years ago at this dealership. While it had a current inspection, the tires needed to be replaced immediately. The airbag light has been on since I bought the car. The heating system (and cooling) does not shut off. I was told when I bought it that the heating system was fine.There are no lights on the dash for the heating/cooling system. Now the transmission is acting up. The tack will go very high as it gets stuck in low gear. When I stop the car, turn it off and back on, it somehow must reset itself. My window controls on the driver side door no longer work in the front of the car. The seats are all badly stained. I have had this to a dealer in Warren, PA for repairs, but they have been unable to find the problems. Now, of course, my extended warranty is up and I do not have the funds to purchase another one. This car is a money pit. I love how it drives, but now I'm stuck with an unreliable vehicle that I still owe $14,000 on.",0
"I purchased a 2005 Jeep Liberty new from a local dealer in Mesa, AZ.  The day we picked it up, the water pump was found leaking and was replaced.  Now in October 2011, we have replaced the water pump seven times.  And as I write this, it is back in the shop for a leaking water pump.  The last one lasted three months.  We have had the rear differential replaced three times and it is howling again.  All the window regulators have been replaced at least three times each.  We are so afraid to drive this vehicle out of town.  We rent one instead to go to the mountains or to travel to San Diego.  Our government wants us to buy American.  Why should we?  The USA cannot build an auto like 30 years ago.  I'm very frustrated and will never buy a Chrysler product again nor will anyone in our family do so.",0
The vehicle overheats and accelerates or over revs.  This occurs even with the vehicle idling in park.,0
"This is our third time with the windows failing to open/close - regulators broken, plates, etc. Last time, they fixed the driver's rear window and passenger window. I picked it up from the dealer last night, and now the check engine light is on. It wasn't there when we dropped it off. We'll have to drop it off again tonight for them to fix it. So again, I'm without a car to get around and this is such an inconvenience.",0
"My rear passenger window has broken for the 4th time.  This time, I had had enough so I contacted Chrysler to request payment for the repair.  Two weeks later, and after the most frustrating customer service (or complete lack thereof) experience I have ever had, the window is still broken.  I am so fed up with Chrysler.  Clearly, they have a defective product on the market.  They simply don't care and refuse to issue a recall.  It is deplorable.  I have also had to replace the transmission.  And every time my battery dies, I have to get the car towed, because even after letting it charge for 30-60 minutes, the car dies the minute I put it in gear.  I am making sure everyone I know understands how incredibly horrible this company is and never buys a Chrysler product.  I'm sure glad my tax dollars helped bail Chrysler out.  Well, I am not.",0
"The back driver side window fell down and wouldn't roll back up.  Dealership charged $240 for labor and repairs.  Yesterday, the same thing happened to the back passenger window which cost another $240.  When will they issue a recall on 2006 Liberty's?",0

      The driver's side seat belt locking mechanism (orange button) malfunctioned.  The cost to repair at the dealer was $200 and it was not covered by the warranty.  ** you, Jeep!  The small hydraulic jack used too often to fix many flats since Jeep put ** soft Badyear tires on it.  The jack is stuck in up position.  The small hydraulic devices that hold the hood in open position got worn so it can no longer hold the hood open.  I had to open the hood a lot.Now, I use an approximately 2 ft. section of PVC pipe as a hood holder, which bounces around under the tiny back seat.  ** you, Jeep!  The breaks squeaked and wore out twice in nine years.  What the **?  They still squeak and it now vibrates when engaged and while stopping the **.  ** you, Jeep!  The radiator is made of plastic.

The engine leaks oil now and the ** at the dealership says that the main seal ($500 repair) needs replacing.  Yep, another Jeep trick underway.  ** you, Jeep!  I let it leak all the time and carry around an extra quarts of oil to replenish it as necessary.  ** you, Jeep!  The windshield blew out three times and the repairs were costly.

"To start, my father retired from Chrysler and we have always had Chrysler products. We have owned four or five jeeps, plus other Chrysler cars. My son and son-in-law both have Dodge Ram pickup trucks, so Chrysler is in our blood. Until now! I will never buy Chrysler. Years ago, like 45 years, Chrysler was known for not starting in rainy weather. Is this what you are going back to?
      We bought a new 2009 Jeep Liberty and not too long after we bought it, they had to replace the whole transmission. We have experienced terrible gas mileage of no more than 14 mpg, city or highway. That is awful. We would have gotten rid of it except we four down tow it and have the tow bar installed on it. We also have a brake buddy for it.Lately the key lock has not been working right, slow, and we thought it was needing a new battery. Then one morning, we went to leave in the car and all the dash lights came on and wipers wouldn't turn off. Then the car locked in park. We tried to figure it out for days and the dash finally said ""no bus"". You can't find out what that means anywhere. We finally got it out of park and drove it to the dealership. Guess what, dash board cluster was bad and to the tune of $608.00. This Jeep is only 1700 miles over warranty. We also have a 15-year-old Chev truck with 150,000 miles and never had the problems this Jeep has had, plus it gets way better gas mileage. The dealership Cueter Chrysler is the best I have ever worked with and their service is second to none. Too bad they don't have good vehicles to work on.I think Chrysler should at least pay the bill on this because it should have never gone bad in the first place. I feel I have a lemon, and being disabled and retired, I should not have to worry about this happening on a pretty new vehicle. Please let me know if you are willing to do anything for us, or whether or not I should carry on with this complaint.",0
"My Limited Jeep Liberty 2004 revs up when at a stop, particularly at stop signs and stop lights. This seems to be a problem with many jeeps after doing some search on the internet. The revving up has been getting worse.
      In addition, I just realized that I paid for the replacement of bad ball joints on my car soon after I purchased it from Diamond Dodge Jeep Chrysler in Flagstaff, AZ. Unfortunately, I have no clue about cars and I was told that I needed a replacement which cost close to $1,000 and only later, much later to find out that I had replaced and paid for something that there was a recall for. I took it back to the same dealership for the recall and they never once told me that they were going to refund me for the $1.000. I know I sound very dumb that I went along with the mechanic when they told me that my car needed two new ball joints and then later took it back in for a recall and only now finding out that they were the same issue. The terrible part is that I got it both done at the same dealership that I bought my car from and they did not tell me that they had the ball joints fixed already and that they would refund me my $1,000, instead, they told me they replaced the ball joints after they already had fixed it. Unfortunately, I can't do anything about it now as I've noticed that that dealership no longer exists, probably because they were up to no good.Is there anything I can do or anything you would recommend to me to do for both of my issues above?",0
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty rear window regulators have been replaced four times.  We do not even use the rear windows so there is no reason for them to just drop while driving.  Jeep will not do anything about this, and as I am seeing, this is a common problem.",0
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty (standard) has had all four windows changed.  It needed a new steering column because of a part built into the column to recognize the key (wouldn't start).  Also, it needed a new transfer case, and the back window leaks into the vehicle.  The shifting lever kept coming out when operating the vehicle.  The jack for changing tires doesn't lift the car up high enough to change the tire.
      Jeep dealer said that there was nothing wrong with the windows until they finally recalled them.  I had to duct tape them up so they wouldn't fall into the frame.  There was no point in locking the vehicle when all we had to do was push the window down!  My windows are beginning to sound just like they did when I had to have them all replaced the last time because the glass would fall into the door frame.I had to get a steering column from eBay because we were told by the dealer that they were on triple back order throughout the whole United States!  I also had to replace the transfer case when it blew apart in my driveway trying to move it after a heavy snow to get the driveway plowed.  I haven't even tried to fix the leak in the back window yet.  I had to get stack wood under the jack until it could lift the car up enough to change the tire.  What's next?  A five years old without off road driving and it is falling apart.  Not cool.",0

"This is my second Jeep. My 2001 Laredo experienced locking or freezing of the SUV. Very scary, driving down the interstate when your SUV freezes and you have no power or control, no power steering and you have to pray and glide to the side of the inner side of the highway. 
      This happened to me 3 times.I traded it, and bought a 2006 Laredo and thought my problems would be gone. Just the start! With 60,000 miles on it, I have the transmission light going off and the system goes into a slipping out of gear or a revving. I have to shake the gear knob to get it ""out"" of the malfunctioning mode! I have read a lot of similar problems. Besides these not-so-scary problems are the following: the seat belt light is on with the ** chime on, the air bag light is on, the check gas cap is on, and my low tire light is on. Believe me, my husband has checked all four tires with the gauge, filled them properly and there is nothing wrong with the tires! I will never ever buy or suggest a jeep to anyone! I hate Chrysler and believe me they are aware of these problems.Today, I am on my way to shop to see what they can or can't do to the jeep. Last time, when I had the tranny light problem, the shop said, ""Well, it isn't on now!"" Well, that is Murphy's law! It was on all the way down 44 miles to the service shop, but then when the ** jeep is being looked at, the light isn't on. This is a nightmare!",0
"In 2008, I purchased a New Jeep Patriot. In 2011 with only 28,915 miles on the vehicle, I had to replace both ball joints, and since the ball joint on this vehicle can only be replaced with the attached control arm, they also had to be replaced. I also had to replace two front tires because from rubbing on the defective parts, the tires were worn down to the steel belts. There is no way that this should have occurred with the low mileage on the vehicle. Jeep tells me that they have no recall on this model.",0
My Jeep's window regulators keep breaking.  I have installed four now and another just broke.  I have replaced each window now at least once.  The plastic nylon clips break and the cable winds inside the housing.  Chrysler has not recalled the regulators.  There is no recourse except to pay another $90 off the Internet and buy another one.  I don't know how they can get by with this.  There is enough complaints filed.  What is your organization doing to help?,0
"The rear power window regulator for my 2005 Jeep Liberty has broken three times. It broke in May on the first year, broke again in July of next year, and broke again in August of the following year. The window regulator replacement part seems to last only 14 months. This is disgusting and costly. It costs me hundreds of dollars. Jeep needs to compensate those of us who keep having to pay for these repairs, fix the windows or switch to crank windows in the back. Do we really need power windows in the back of a Jeep?",0
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty and I found I had bought a window monster. Not only did the regulator break, but you had to put a new window to go with it. I had six windows replaced, and two of them were the new model.
      I had 3 weeks left on my warranties when the last one happened. I argued with the service writer and he gave me a number to call. I called and argued with them and then I went to the website and sent in multiple complaints.Well, Jeep responded and sent me an extension, for the windows and regulators only, for ten years and it will go with the vehicle. So, go get them. They will work with you if you yell loud enough. I hope this helps the rest of the window droppers.",0
"The 2010 Jeep Commander had a problem with the transmission and was told it was the torque converter and was in the shop for approximately a week. It is in for a second time for the transmission and was told that it has to be rebuilt, not replaced. It has been almost 2 weeks and still no vehicle. This is our fourth vehicle from this dealer and we also have problems with our 2008 Dodge 2500 Big Horn Diesel which has been in twice for a turbo problem and still having problems. We are very unhappy and would like some sort of satisfaction. Thank you for your time.",0
"Repair Issues - An improper or inferior repair
      Problem: On the 24 Nov 2010, I came into the Springfield Jeep and Chrysler dealership because my car had ran hot the day before. They said the problem was the therostate, but they could not tell which one was not opening so they said both had to be replaced. So I left my car and they replaced the first one and they had to order the second one. I returned on 2 Dec 2010 to have the second one replaced. Then two months later, my car ran hot again. So I was told to bring the car back, but the car did not run hot for them so they said they could not find out what the problem was so I left with my car and was told if it runs hot again bring it back. In two more months it ran hot again, again nothing happened in which they could not tell me what was going on. This continued until a week ago, when my car ran hot and would not cool down and I could not make it out to the dealership who had serviced it. I was told to take it to Liberty jeep and Chrysler in Hinesville, GA, where it is today. They told me something foreign was placed in the radiator and that I need a new radiator, new engine and air conditioner unit because the problem with my car was not fixed. It had gotten so bad everything was going wrong. Prior to this, my car was serviced in Maryland where I lived --at Fred's Jeep ad Chrysler in Laurel, MD. I have a Jeep Patriot 2007, Silver which I purchased in 2008. So basically, I only had this car for two years. I am very dissatisfied with this service and unhappy about my car because now I do not have a car.",0
"The window regulators on my Jeep Liberty broke for a total of 5 times now, multiple times on the same windows. Jeep is aware of the problem and refuses to do anything about the problem. However, they just love to charge up to $500 to fix the problem for us. Just look at how many consumers have been burnt by this same problem.",0
"I have a 2007 Jeep Commander. I have been having issues with not starting/stalling. I can be driving and when I shut it off and then go to turn it back on, it will not start.  All I hear is a clicking noise under the hood by the long black fuse box. 
      The lights, radio, etc. all works--it just wont start. This only happens every so often. I have not been able to narrow it down. No one seems to be able to pinpoint what the problem is. I have had so much money wrapped into figuring this out. I went online to try to see if anyone else has these issues. I was amazed at how many complaints of my kind there are. Wow. Jeep is getting away with this. I have been stranded so many times and unable to drive my Jeep Commander.",0
"I was auto wreck on August 13, 2011 and my 2002 Jeep Liberty air bags didn't work. My jeep was totaled and I got pretty banged up. By the grace of our Lord, I'm still here, steering. I just purchased the Jeep on August 1, 2011 and when the rear tire blew, I had to go into semi-truck.",0
"On the first day that I bought the 2006 Jeep Commander, I noticed that when it rains, it leaks through the front passenger grab handles. Also, the door handles gone busted and broken. The engine died quickly, in which I had to pay $100 to fix it. ESP/BAS light, traction light, check engine light and tire pressure light turned on after a loud sound. The air-condition was making a grinding noise while on “low” and “medium” but works out fine on “high.” 
      Because the windows were cracked, you can feel the heat pouring through the vents. The radio volume will go up without you touching it and the cruise control will not work now that the dash lights are on.I went to take it back to the dealer and they couldn’t help me because the lights were not on all the time. So I took the jeep to another Dodge dealer to see if we can get somewhere with them.I have purchased the extended warranty and it currently has 65K miles. I just want the dealer to fix the jeep because I am not paying for something that I’m scared to put my kids in.",0
"I am a corporate manager for a global company in Austin, Texas and am embarrassed in front of my colleagues to have purchased a Jeep.  I am extremely disappointed in my much anticipated custom ordered 2011 Jeep Sahara  4D 4x4, VIN: BL611285, purchased/picked up on May 13, 2011.
      I have purchased a Lemon and am extremely disappointed and embarrassed with all the issues I am experiencing with this Jeep.  It has left me stranded multiple times, where I've had to pull over and wait on the side of the road.  Twice it had to be towed, the farthest has been 150 miles away from my residency.  This has affected my life and interrupted my work schedule several times.On August 15, on multiple times, Jeep had to be towed to dealership due to loss of communication with computer. Repaired on August 10.  On August 2, the second time the Jeep went to dealership due to loss of communication with computer.  Hot oil and warning lights caused me to pull over, then Jeep would not start.  Work was performed on Aug. 10, re-flash computer. On July 14,  62 days from purchase date, I brought the Jeep to shop for miscellaneous issues and concern on rough engine start.  On June 23, 41 days from purchase date, warning lights flashed on.  During this time, I saw hot oil flashing  pulled over and called towing.  Work was performed (replaced wind module sensor--this seemed to address warning light issues).I am frustrated beyond belief that I am now considering following the recommendation of my Lemon Law lawyer, in addition to reporting my experiences with the BBB, plus publicize to numerous colleagues, family and friends on why they should not purchase a Jeep from Chrysler.I purchased  the Jeep upon recommendation from family members who also recommended Jeeps to several friends, some actually purchasing from Chrysler. I'm done  and no longer have patience to waste valuable time on a vehicle that I'm literally afraid it will  leave me stranded.",0
"Two 2007 Jeep Liberty Limited had trouble with windows malfunctioning, and is still ongoing.
      I replaced the AC compressor a year ago. The Jeep does not cool effectively after less than a year. The dealership stated it will not cover AC compressor because it was under warranty.I’m not sure if they put a rebuilt compressor or a new one or if it is another problem. The dealership rode with me and stated the system is working but maybe it is an electrical problem that warrants investigation. I have 50,000 miles on it.",0
"The brakes on our 2009 Jeep Commander have been squeaking very loud since we bought it.  I have taken it in a few times.  And the dealer said it's just how they are.  I paid for brake inspection to have them tell me that every time.  This is our third Chrysler.  If this is not taken care of, I will no longer be a customer of yours.  I will let my friends and family know.  I will try very hard to push a Ford or GM product on them! Thanks. Vince :)",0
"I have not had an accident and nobody has hit me.  I have a 2003 Jeep Liberty and the airbag light has come on for the driver's side.  This is a safety factor of the vehicle.  And I would like to know why it is not a recall.  Please email me and let me know.  I don't think it is fair to make me pay for this to be repaired.
      Thank you.Jane **",1
"My 98 Jeep is an amazing car.  It has saved my life a few times.  The major issue I've had with it is that a few years ago, I had to have the transmission replaced and fixed.  Almost immediately, I blamed the shop.  Thank God for warranties.  I've had it for 5 years.  And it still runs great.  But the issue now is that the gas mileage is slowly getting worse.  I don't know if it's just crappy gas companies putting something in the gas or what.  But I live about an hour out of Austin.  And it used to use less than a quarter of a tank to get there and back.  Now, even if I don't run the AC, it uses more than a quarter.  Let me just say it's Texas summer in a black jeep with no AC, and gas prices are going up everyday.",1
"My 2005 Jeep Liberty has faulty window regulators (these are used to operate the electric windows). This is a problem with all Jeep Liberty’s – there are thousands of complaints.
      It costs 400 to 500 dollars to fix it and the part continues to break over and over. Jeep refuses to issue a recall. I just had one replaced 21 months ago and it has broken again. The window just falls into the door without warning. It is very dangerous.",0
"I was heading home from a weekend away in my 2007 Jeep Commander with 62,000km on it and I heard a weird noise coming from the engine compartment. Then I smelled antifreeze and I start losing power. So I pulled off the highway and find a safe place to park, opened the hood and noticed that the fan blades that were attached to the water pump were hitting the alternator and I also noticed the antifreeze pouring out everywhere. 
      I called road side and they told me that a tow truck was on its way, but I had nowhere to stay as I was several hours away from home and no rental car company was open to rent me a car as it was late at night. So I spoke with roadside assistance and they assured me that a rental car would be covered while my car was getting fixed. So I found a place to spend the night and rented a car the next day to drive home. When I got home the next day, I called customer service and they informed me that the rental car was not covered and that I was out of luck.",0
"In October of 2009, I purchased a 2009 Jeep Compass as a trade in from a Chrysler 300 that was too hard on gas. Now July 2011, less than 3 years later, I have just paid $4200+ to replace a transmission that was blown. I also had to rent a vehicle to the tune of $300.00+ to accommodate by business travel as I am the owner of 2 businesses that require extensive travel. I have written 3 letters in total to the Windsor Office of Chrysler sent it both by mail & fax and have had not even so much as a courtesy phone call or reply from them regarding my very urgent situation with one of their vehicle. The mere fact that none has taken the time to even seem as if they are addressing my concerns extremely agitates me. I Interact daily with rental car companies who also purchase vehicles from Chrysler and I am extremely saddened by their lack of customer service. I am a paying customer to the vehicle manufacturer and deserve to be treated much better than I have thus far.",0
"Jeep should be absolutely shamed of themselves. I too am having problems with the window regulators on my 2007 jeep liberty. Now, the drivers window has to be helped to rise out of the door as you push on the button. How can they continue to have a deaf ear. I'm telling everyone that is thinking of buying one about my experiences.",0
"I took my 2006 Jeep Commander to Odessa,Texas repair shop on June 27 to have the AC fixed.  That went out 60 miles from home on Sunday, June 26. It was in the shop for 15 days. Got it out July 11. 
      I was told two-three days and it would be ready. Fifteen days later, it was ready. No parts had to be ordered for the AC.  One part was ordered for the temp ready inside of jeep on Thursday and received on Monday morning and then it was ready that afternoon.This will be the last time we will buy any brand that you sell.  I had doctor appointments and a lot of errands to do.  It was very hard for family and friends to stop and take time to help me out.  I am very unhappy about this problem and something needs to be done about it.",0
