"I bought a brand new 2008 Jeep Liberty in February 2009; after a year and a half of purchase, my rear brakes went out. I called the service department and was told the brakes were not under warranty. I proceeded to taking it to another repair shop. I was informed that it is very uncommon for rear brakes to go out so soon. I had no other choice, but to replace the brakes without any further question.
      Now after just three-four months later, I began having more issues with the vehicle; smoking in the rear end, oil leaking and the smell of something burning and then the rattling in the rear, which ended with the rear brakes completely locking up on me--leaving me stranded at night, with my six year old son and my 18 month old daughter. I had to have the car towed to the dealership the following day. They had the vehicle for two days, stating it was the rear-end differential that went out. I was at that time asking for a rental car, which the dealership said they did not do. So, I was at that point without a vehicle, and I had to miss work for three days while it was being repaired. I got the vehicle back by the third day. The next day, while driving the vehicle to work, I started to notice a humming sound when I would accelerate. I also still noticed the burning odor in the rear end. The humming sound was to the point that even my six year old asked me why the car was making a sound. It took me a week to call the dealership again regarding these issues due to the fact that I simply needed my vehicle. I did not want to miss any more days of work. During this week’s time, the car battery went dead while I was trying to make it to my children’s babysitter and to my place of employment. This of course caused me to be late to my job once again. I contacted the dealership and brought the vehicle back in. It is now three days, and they still have my car.I received a call from Sam ** on Friday afternoon. She stated they needed to wait for a spare part for the repair, and they could not tell me when they would be able to have the vehicle finished. She also implied that the vehicle was inspected, and was perfectly fine when it left the dealership. I asked at this time to speak to a manager, as my frustration was reaching its limit. I spoke to three different people who stated the managers were all in a meeting; so, I left two different messages for a manager to return my call, which they never did. I am now again stuck at home with my two young children without a way to get around.The idea that this is a new vehicle and is already having so many problems is very disturbing to me. My sole purpose of having a new vehicle with monthly car payments is so that I do not break down like this. I feel that, at the very least, this dealership should supply me with a loaner vehicle, and have the common courtesy to at least return my call as any business should do to satisfy their customers.",NA
"We have a 2006 Jeep Commander. It was built after January of 2006; so, it does not fall under the recall. All of the lights on the dashboard of the vehicle would light up and then it would immediately shut off. The same with the gas gauge, RPM, and climate controls. The vehicle will still drive. When we have taken it to several Jeep dealers and other mechanics, no one was able to tell us what is wrong with the vehicle. We had nothing but only problems with this vehicle, including installing a new starter which seems to be a known problem, as well as the leaking through the hand grips for driver and passenger.
      It is frightful and dangerous to be in a vehicle going 60mph, plus just to have all the lights on then everything will shut off except the engine. We even had a diagnostic at home, and it does not indicate what the problem is. After the problem happens, the check engine light does not stay on. So, it is difficult to get a reading. Is there a recall to get this electrical problem fixed? What should we do since we are scared to drive the vehicle due to this problem? Please, let me know.Thank you,Kristin **",NA
"2006 Jeep Commander with consistent problems for the duration of ownership.  Now 15 seal points in the front of the vehicle have come apart and water leaks into the car from every angle when it rains having ruined the electrical, carpets, not to mention developing mold and mildew - even after we've had the carpets cleaned numerous times - we can't keep up with the rate at which it rains and floods.  Gallons of water stand in the floorboard and it drips near the brake and accelerator, on many occasions my foot has slipped.  
      It is a complete health and safety hazard.  They kept saying it was the sunroof drains and to have them blown out so I was going in once per month but now the dealership has revealed the problem and that it's not the first case, but neither they or Jeep will come forward with a solution and it's a continuous run around, going on 6 months.  We've had 3 case managers from Jeep already and they keep passing us off and we just want it fixed or out of this Jeep! No one (other dealerships) will take the Commander for what we owe because of its damage and their notorious problems.",NA
"2009 Dodge Journey had to replace both front & back brakes & pads & rotors when vehicle had just over 31,000 miles",NA
We have a 2007 Jeep Commander and have had problems with the car accelerating and the check engine light coming on. We took it to the Jeep dealer and they have determined that we need to replace the electronic shift module. I have seen multiple complaints or people with the same issue. This part needs to be recalled and fixed. Any other consumers with this problem should file a complaint with Jeep Chrysler to hopefully initiate a recall notice!,NA
"My husband and I purchased a 2006 Jeep Commander in October 2005. I didn’t have very many problems with the Jeep until September 2009. While driving on the freeway at 70 mph, the jeep stalled on me and the check engine light came on. I was able to get off the freeway and have it towed to a dealership. I was told that I needed to have my throttle body cleaned. $200.00 later, I was on the freeway. In October 2010, my Jeep started stalling on me again. I was told that my throttle body needed cleaning again. 
      The Jeep ran fine for a month or so. In April 2011, I took the Jeep in for servicing. Of course, throttle body cleaning again. Since then, I have taken my Jeep back to the dealership at least every two weeks for stalling. I was driving on the freeway and it stalled on me. I was told a piece of cloth somehow got caught near the throttle body. It worked for two weeks, and then it stalled on me again. I was told that I needed to change my mapping sensor and IACV valve. I changed those and a week later, it was back again. A week after that it was back again, all for stalling and idling RPM, I was driving home on June 15, 2011 and the Jeep stalled on me while in the middle of traffic and I was almost rear-ended by a truck. Needless to say, I have filed complaints with Chrysler and Jeep. They refuse to help me with a rental car since I am out of warranty. They haven't offered to help with repair costs. I asked them to help me get into another vehicle and that was refused. Even the service advisor at Dodge told me he didn’t think I would ever put my kids in that Jeep again. I am frustrated and need help.",NA
"I had my motor stalling in 2010 Jeep Commander. It stalled in an intersection, almost causing an accident with other vehicles.",NA
"Hi. My car has stalled on several occasions, either while waiting at the traffic light or in the middle of an intersection. I called my Jeep Dealer's Service (Farrish, Fairfax, VA) and they told me that I must have bought ""bad gas."" I also have had my 2006 Commander not start several times and I have replaced two batteries at their recommendation. It is now at the service center because for the last week it would not start until I jammed the key in the ignition and prayed. I have told them many times that I think there is an electrical short/misfire (as the dash lights blink spontaneously even when the radio is off) and they do not believe that my car will not start. They have repeatedly told me ""we cannot reproduce your concern."" I am now scared as I have four children and I am a single parent. Please help.",NA
"I want to know why it is that Jeep Liberty rear passenger automatic window motors are always breaking. We replaced or repaired the left side twice. Now the right side is doing the same thing. Both windows are now taped into place. Why can't Jeep make a manual window crank? The Jeep liberty is a 2007 model year. This is so far the only problem, but I have been told by other owners that this is a constant problem. My warranty is out now. What is my remedy?",NA
"Back in 2007, we purchased a brand new 2007 Silver Jeep Liberty off the lot.  During that time, my wife was active duty army (and still is).  In the state of Colorado when you are active duty, you do not need your title to register the car.  They only need a copy of your orders and an affidavit of non-residence.  So for the first 2 years, we had no problem registering our car.  However, in 2009, we relocated to Florida on a new assignment.  We had then made the decision to register our car down here and that is where the fun began.  We went to the DMV and they requested the title and gave us temporary tags.  When those expired a month later, we went back to register the car but they didn't get the title.  At that time, we weren't worried.
      The DMV requested it again and gave us a new set of temporary tags.  Again, we got no call that our title was in so when those expired, the DMV still hadn't received our title.  Now it was worry time as the DMV said 2 temporary tags were the max.  We started frantically calling to see what the deal with our title was.   We found out that this car had never been titled.  At this point, we were confused (around late 2009 early 2010) after numerous phone calls and even more assurances that it was being handled.  It is now 5/27/2011.  After getting off the phone, they still have no clue to the title on this vehicle.  Even to exacerbate the problem further, we got rid of our second vehicle (another Jeep, which I will never make that mistake again), as we were moving to a 2-mile by 4-mile island.  So, this is our only car with 2 young children.  And it is illegal to drive and we can't get base tags either.  So, we can't leave our house in the car!In this case, you may think they would offer a loaner or a rental to get us by while they figure out our title.  But there my friends you would be wrong, as even when asked, they denied us a viable alternative.  So here I am typing this in awe and bewilderment to the treatment I have received from Chrysler and Lithia dealership on not only their ineptitude, but on their unwillingness to offer a short term solution to a problem that has lasted for almost 2 years now, and that we have no control over.  Oh, but don't let us be late on a payment or then we would be toast.  But no, we have never been late on a payment and we still carry insurance on this illegal car.  And here’s one extra tidbit.  3 of the 4 windows have malfunctioned (which they have recalled but we can't resolve in an illegal car).  And the A/C quit working a year ago (which needs a $500 plus compressor and labor cost).  Thank you Jeep/Chrysler for finally convincing me to buy only foreign made cars, as this is my last straw with your cheaply made junk!",NA
"The window regulators break four times on my 2005 Jeep Liberty--twice on driver's rear, one time on passenger's rear, and one time on passenger's front.  My window fell down in the middle of a parking lot--I came out to the car and found it that way twice.  Other two times, it just fell when I tried to use it.  My car could have been vandalized, stuff stolen from it, or if it had been raining, been ruined inside.  I'm tired of dealing with this problem.  I am afraid every time I drive it that the windows will fail.",NA
"The faulty window regulator switch was replaced 11 times. It is now currently broken. The 13 total parts broken over its life from 2002 Jeep Liberty Sport. 
      The corporation will not assist in the cost of this part even if it has been replaced 11 times on the same issue. Apparently, there is a new improved part that they are offering and they think that they are successful with it. This is $280 to be fixed versus the $350 it used to be. I know that the other window will break again which will be another $280 for the same part being the 13th time I have to replace the part. I would like a discounted rate for replacing these parts or even for free since an estimate cost over the years to replace it has been $3,850.",NA
"We are US citizens living in Belgium and driving a European 2007 Jeep Compass. We have had multiple problems with it. Most of them have been fixed at an auto shop close to where we live. In the event of a larger problem with the gear box in the transmission, we had no other choice but to take it to a Jeep garage to be fixed. This was the closest one to our house in Belgium. When we returned to pick the Jeep up 2 days later, we were given a bill for 100 euro and we're told they were not be able to fix the problem. But they did find it was the gear box which needed work. So upon speaking with the service manager and coming to the agreement, no work was done and nothing new discovered. We were still left to pay the bill (or they would not give us the keys).",NA
"I purchased a brand new 2006 Jeep Commander, Hemi, 4x4, fully loaded.  It was the first brand new car purchase for me and the worst experience.  What a disappointment!  It's a beautiful car on the outside but beware.  It’s a mechanic’s dream and owner's nightmare!  Thank goodness I purchased an extended warranty on the ** thing as it has helped with some of the expenses.  Two weeks after owning the car, there was a bad knocking noise in the engine.  I had it taken to the dealership twice.  Of course, they couldn't duplicate the issue.  2 mechanics who heard it all told me it was the lifters.  Nothing ever got done.  To this day, it still makes a knocking noise without any warning.  Like the others, this car has left me stranded a total of 5 times.  It has had 3 batteries put in.
      The last battery change seemed to help.  But I pray every time I start my car that it doesn't happen again.  I had to replace both front and back brakes at 12,000 miles.  And I had to do another back rotor and back break change at 30,000 miles.  At 40,000, the front left wheel bearings went out.  Then at 77,000 miles, the radiator leaked and had to be replaced.  Also, the windshield wiper pump went out and had to be replaced.  But that's not it.  I can't get but 15,000 miles out of the tires I put on regardless of the brand.  I have had to put new tires on my Jeep each year I have owned it.  They are rotated on a regular basis so I don't know what the heck is going on.  The tires wear terribly on the outside and inside with plenty of tread still left in the middle.  I have had to do so much maintenance to this car for it being brand new and well taken care of.  I couldn't give this vehicle away at this point, nor would I want to burden anyone down with the expense!",NA
I have had the window regulator replaced three times on the passenger rear window and twice on the driver rear window. Driving with little ones in the back seat is a problem with the window down. Duck tape does work but it takes off the window film I had placed on due to the Texas sun.,NA
"Chrysler is refusing any type of financial assistance to my Jeep Liberty with 56,000 miles that is yet to be paid off. Even though the warranty has expired, I think it's a shame that a corporation refuses to stand by their products, at least until it's paid for. Repair cost $1,582.",NA
"Over the past couple of months, my vehicle has gotten progressively worse with intermittent engine stalls. After Googling this problem and seeing that this is an inherent problem with Jeep, I felt that it needed to be documented.
      So far I've been lucky that it hasn't stalled in the middle of an intersection. Hopefully, Chrysler Jeep will do something to remedy this problem before someone gets seriously hurt.",NA
"This is a complaint about the design of the SUV.  Last year, I bought a 2010 Jeep Commander and I am very surprised about how inefficient things were designed. They didn't put any thought into things.  My very old Mitsubishi Endeavor is far superior. At least they took the time to make the SUV with a good interior and efficient design. I am not buying another American SUV ever again.",NA

"My 2007 Jeep Commander stalled while driving on the highway above 50 mph.  Sometimes, it would not shift or would delay in shifting from low gear.  Sometimes, the panel display would show all gears light up when problems occurred.  Now, the vehicle will not start without changing gears several times--if it starts at all.

"Random acceleration and /or inability to accelerate when pushing the gas pedal as well as the windshield design is such that it doesn't deflect stones, even with a guard. I have been driving my 2007 Jeep Commander for 3 months and have 4 cracks in my windshield from stones hitting it while driving, not off road either. These problems are expensive to fix and are dangerous not to fix. Very disappointed in what I thought was a reliable vehicle.",NA

"My complaint concerns one that has been voiced by many and that is the defective product Jeep used for electric windows. Both my rear windows don't work and one keeps inching down, so I have been taping it to keep it rolled up. I had a shop look at it and they told me that it is so common, the part to correct it is back ordered for 2 weeks. Jeep should have recalled their vehicles for this! It will cost me almost $400 to repair this.",NA
"In my 2006 Jeep Commander the door latches break. Now I’m stuck in the car in fear that if I’m in a car accident, I can’t get out. I talked to the car dealer and they say that it’s because of wear and tear. Back doors are also broken and they are barely used.",NA

"I am writing about my 2005 Jeep Liberty. At around 40,000 miles I needed a new engine on one side and the other side a few months later. My window regulators continue to break in the back while my car is just sitting. I never roll the back windows down and they are seldom used. I have been charged up to $387.00 for this item and they have been repaired five times now. This should be a recall item I have never had a vehicle do these things before. I have spoken to other jeep liberty customers with the same problems. (Engine and windows)The problem with the window part is the plastic that just snaps in the cold or hot weather. $300.00 and some odd dollars is a lot to keep paying for this over and over again.",NA
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty in April 2008. The car had 14000+ miles. I brought the car back short time after purchasing because of a window problem. I was told it was dirty down inside. It happened again and I said I can not come every time. I found out the window regulator to be no good. The front driver side, then a while later, the back driver's side. They said they did a courtesy fix. But I purchased an extended warranty that the salesperson told me was bumper to bumper up to 60,000 miles.
      I also knew at this time that the window regulators were defective, and that they made a whole new window placement. I paid 100.00 ded for my insurance for a defective product. Well, now my 3rd window passenger back side ops 8th or 9th time down. It broke while I have 40,000+. I was still assuming it was under warranty as I have a great warranty, as I was told when being pushed into purchasing at the beginning and told never have to worry. Well, that was bull**.Now I was told it would cost 600.00 plus to fix. That it was not covered under warranty. I went postal. I am going to report this to BBB. also to Chrysler. The service person called me and said the manager would give me a courtesy and this would be the last one. Are they for real? This is a defect in their product and they think they're doing me a favor. I paid for a warranty. and they took my 100.00 ded last time. Do not buy jeep.",NA
A 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo keeps stalling out while driving. I have replaced a lot of parts yet the problem still exists. I have checked the internet and found a lot of jeep owners who have the same problem. I think this jeep should be recalled and all jeeps with this problem and fix them. It is dangerous. It just stalls out anywhere with no warning.,NA
"In 2006 I bought a brand new Jeep Compass. I drove it off the light, not knowing a light was an engine light problem, it took the dealership 7 months to figure out how to turn the engine light off. Then approximately one year after I bought it, the right ball joint went out. I took it back in and they fixed it. It was under warranty. Then 43000 miles and 3 years later, the left ball joint went out, but it is no longer under warranty. Because it was unsafe and not under warranty, I took it to a frame and axle place by my house. I then called Jeep corporate to ask if they would reimburse me and stand behind their product because a ball joint should not be going out in a pretty new vehicle. they refused to reimburse me. I am out $469.61 for a defective part that Jeep will not reimburse me for.",NA
"On April 3, 2009, I was told that I needed a regulator for my 2006 Jeep Liberty left rear window. Parts, labor and tax equaling $277.29. Again on August 30, 2010, I was told I needed another regulator and glass for the same window at a total cost of $357.60. This is obviously a defective, faulty part being manufactured out of Chrysler, especially since I am single and that window is rarely ever used. I would like to be at least partly reimbursed for this issue. $357.60 spent on second regulator in the only window in less than 17 months.",NA
I bought a Jeep Commander in 2007. The dash lights keep going off and then they would all come on. The air conditioning will go off while driving down the road. It does this for about 1 minute and then everything goes back to normal. I have taken it to the shop twice and they cannot find anything wrong. I have read many complaints about this similar problem and people are saying that their jeep just dies while driving causing a very dangerous situation which could lead to a very severe if not fatal accident.,NA
"I dropped off my Jeep to get fix the roof because it got stuck in one corner and they said that okay, they were going to fix it. Still after so many lies and no phone calls. Twelve days later and counting and no one is willing to help. I have no car stuck in my house, didn't give me a rental a car or at least willing to help me. It's stressful being home stuck at home.",NA
"We purchased a 2006 Jeep Commander in 2008. My complaint is headlights flickers on and off along with the dash lights. We have a basic model. Our headlights have to be turned on. Our vehicle does not have running headlights. There's no warning when the headlights will flicker on and off. This all happens while I'm driving at night. You can be driving and or the car is sitting still. I've taken our vehicle to be serviced at Jeep several times. Each time Jeep is unable to find anything wrong with the vehicle.
      They stated, ""it's running fine and we cannot find any problems"". I contacted Jeep Chrysler Group on many occasions at 1-800-. We have asked if we could get a Replacement vehicle. We do not want to trade this vehicle and make this someone else problem. It's not safe to drive. We keep getting the run around. They said we should speak with Nahum, and then he forwarded it to another department. Then they said, Bonnie is our Case Manager. Then they said, Bonnie is not our Case Manager and we were giving the wrong information.Each time we call every week and sometimes twice a week, they tell me someone will contact you. So far, no returned calls. This is really bad customer service. This vehicle is unsafe to drive. I do not drive at night because the headlights flicker on and off and sometimes do not come back on. I'm afraid to drive this vehicle. We have children in the car when this happens. People curse me out, blow their horns and just say some really bad things to me. All because they think I'm turning my headlights on and off at them while driving. I do not want me or my family to get hurt because of this. We need help and there may be someone else in this world that may be going through the same thing. Take this vehicle off the street.",NA
"The third power window regulator failed on my 2004 Jeep Liberty. I just had the driver's side replaced 4 weeks ago at a cost of $150 with the assistance of Chrysler. Both of my rear windows are inoperable at this time because I have been waiting on an after market repair from a third party. Chrysler replaces like for like using the same nylon gear, ergo, it shall fail again. One can say normal wear and tear but I am a single fellow that does not even use the back windows and they are the ones I have blocked up! It would appear, reading all the forums and complaints about the problem, that it is and has been a known design problem for years. It is very sad to know that a company can be ""bailed out"" by taxpayer dollars and continue to not correct the design nor recall the defective vehicles.",NA
"I bought a 2009 Jeep Patriot in July 2009.  A month after having it, I started to notice the gas gauge was not reading accurate.  I took the vehicle to the dealer. They told me it was a problem that Chrysler was aware of but did not know yet how to fix, and that I should continue checking with them for any updates.  In Jan. or Feb. 2010, the dealer said they were told that a fix would be available in Apr. 2010.  That didn't happen.  In May 2010, the dealer said they were told that parts were being manufactured and fix would be released in June or July 2010.  It didn't happen again.
      This time I contacted Chrysler customer complaint phone number and told them I wanted to know when they planned on fixing my vehicle, because I have had it for a year and it had a defect all this time.  They kept referring me to a case manager that they had assigned to me.  But he would never return my calls to tell me when the fix would be released to the dealers.  I called customer service numerous times and complained about the vehicle not being fixed and about the case manager not returning phone calls.  I was told that Chrysler had no more info on the problem and it was in the hands of the business office and the district manager over the dealerships.  I told them I wanted to speak to someone who was in charge of the case managers.  But they pretty much refused to that and told me it was not customer service’s problem anymore, and would not let me voice my complaint to anyone higher up in the company. I contacted the dealer again.  They said that the district manager told them that the fix would be released in the first week of August 2010, but it appears that will not happen again.  I hate to think this is what we got when we bailed Chrysler out.  They have never even offered me anything for the year.  I have sat back and waited on them to solve the problem.  But they told me lie after lie and that I must continue waiting and paying for a vehicle that I never have a clue how much gas it really has in it.",NA
"I have a 2005 Jeep Liberty that had the motor replaced in February of 2009. The motor only had about 64000 miles on it. The motor messed up again in May 2010. This time, the motor had around 42000 miles on it. The old motor was replaced with a Chrystler motor. The dealership told me the warranty was only good for 12 months or 12000 miles which ever came first. 
      I will never get a Chrystler product again because of the service I have received! My Jeep has been nothing but a big headache from the time I got it. I had the front drive shaft replaced last year. The brakes and rotors have been replaced four times in two years. The water pump was replaced last year and the timing belt was also replaced. I am very dissatisfied with my Jeep Liberty and I would not recommend one to anyone else!",NA
"Since I purchased my 2004 Jeep, 3 of the 4 window regulators have failed. Recall anyone? The window just drops unexpectedly. Luckily, my car hasn't been burglarized after the window dropped overnight. I'm a 3rd year law student and my school isn't exactly in the nicest neighborhood. I would really hate to have any of my casebooks stolen. The Jeep dealer wants $500 to fix it since my car is no longer covered under warranty. Private auto mechanics charge $200 for the part and average $90 for the labor. So there's that, plus a few bucks for the duct tape that now holds my window in place. Classy.",NA
"I have a 2005 Jeep liberty and my ABS, ESP BAS, and Traction Control lights have all come on. I have done a lot of research on the internet about this and found that it is a very common occurrence. I see that the 2007 Jeep Liberty has been recalled for this problem, and I'm wondering why the 2005-2006 ones haven't been? 
      I live in a place where it snows 6 months out of the year, and I have no traction control or automatic breaks, I cannot even drive my vehicle in the winter time!",NA
"Our 2005 Jeep, without any lift kit or modifications done to it, has the 'death wobble.' The first time it happened it was under warranty and we were told it needed to have the rotors turned. We did that. Now it is out of warranty and they want $1000 to fix it. We only have 25,000 miles on it.",NA
"I have a 2006 Jeep Commander which I purchased a short time ago. On a recent trip, my son went to open the passenger door and the interior door latch would not open the door. The part of the door panel which holds the latch had completely broken away from the panel. I also see that this is happening to the driver's door as well. It is a safety issue as one could become trapped in the vehicle. I understand that this is an ongoing problem with this vehicle. I also understand that it may be an expensive repair.",NA
"This will be the 4th window that I have had to replace/repair in my Jeep Liberty. There is a known defect in the design of the original window regulator. Jeep has since redesigned the part but it requires a new glass window as well. Each time the window is repaired it costs $600. Jeep won't recall the parts. Why? Because it is not a high risk safety issue. 
      I would beg to differ when I have my child sitting in the back seat and the regulator decides to go out and the window slides into the door jam giving my toddler access to outside while I'm on the highway. Jeep is making a nice profit for it's dealerships service departments who are getting the big bucks from fixing this issue. At $600 a pop you are looking at $2400 for the 4 windows and I can guarantee you that if you don't have the new design you'll have to replace it.",NA
"My Jeep constantly stalls.  I first started looking online into forums about this issue and found hundreds of the same issue.  Most said that the computer module was the cause.  The times I have had the Jeep checked out, the computer was to blame as well.  So, I had the computer replaced and still have the issue.  I have spent $100 replacing parts and trying to fix the issue but the problem persists. 
      At this point, I don't believe that there is a fix for it, but just a lesson learned not to ever again purchase a Jeep!",NA
"2006 Jeep Liberty window regulator went bad in the passenger rear window. It cost over $400 to replace. Apparently, this is a common defect and Jeep has not issued a recall.",NA
"I have a 2007 Jeep Compass. The first time I started experiencing problems, the engine was stalling and/or wouldn't accelerate. I talked to my brother, who is a mechanic, and he recommended to take it to the dealer, since the vehicle was still under warranty. I gave the car a tune-up. After $300 (apparently regular maintenance is not covered by the warranty), all they did was change some plugs, and check the different oils in the car. 
      Not even two months later, January 2010, my car was towed to the dealer because it completely died. The engine stalled, lights on the dashboard went crazy, and I just couldn't accelerate, and then it simply died in the middle of the road. It wasn't a major road, and it was very early in the morning.  I was taking my kids to ""before care"" at their school.  Thanks to these conditions, there was no accident involved.  The guy who towed my car explained to the dealer that he thought it was the engine, however the dealer, after checking up on my car, decided it was only a bad coil that was causing that on the engine. The guy at the dealer asked me if I had washed my engine, I told him no.  Instead of looking what had caused the coil to go bad, they simply replaced it and sent me on my way. At first the car was running fine, but soon after, I started noticing the same heaviness when accelerating. Five months later, 7/11/2010 to be exact, I was driving down I-16 (GA), and the car started stalling. I couldn't accelerate, even though the gas pedal was down to the car floor. Then my emergency signals on the dashboard started blinking. Apparently, I had a tire with only 10 air pressure. I really was concerned but being about 2 miles away from the exit to my house, I decided to continue.  When I pulled over at the gas station on the corner, the tire was fine, we checked the pressure and it was 35. I was very concerned. So, someone drove the car for me, and noticed the inability of the car to accelerate.  It was almost like the engine couldn't switch or engage, and therefore it was impossible to accelerate. On 7/14/2010, I called the dealership and stated my problem. I also called Chrysler Corporate, and explained my situation, they assigned me a case number. In the afternoon when I took the car to the dealer they said that to be able to look at my car, I will have to pay $75 for the diagnostics. I was furious, since I had taken the car twice to the dealer and they have failed to repair the problem. The issue is that now my warranty is expired, and so I am responsible for the charges. I refused to pay any money, since I believed it was their responsibility to correct whatever it is wrong with my car from the very beginning, and they have not. The dealer agreed to run diagnostics to my car free of charge. However, the dealer and Chrysler states there is no assurance they will cover for repairs, since the car is out of warranty. I feel they failed to repair my car properly, knowing I would be back, and by then the money will have to come out of my pocket. I have read that the stalling problems, the crazy dashboard, and the sudden death of the car, are problems common not only to 2007 Jeep Compass, but also to several other models, and manufactured years. This issue needs to be addressed. I am literally scared to use the car.  I keep thinking it can die on a highway with my kids inside! I have filed a complaint with the NHTSA, and other consumer advocate sites, but I believe someone will have to go through a very serious accident for Chrysler to do something real about this issue, that affects so many of its cars. While writing this, the dealer called and said they weren't able to recreate the problem, but there was a couple of software updates. They performed the updates, and told me to pick up my car. They, however, offered to let me drive the car and see how it performs. If I have any other problems to take it back to the dealer. But during this time, I have to drive the vehicle with whatever problem it still has.  The car is unsafe to drive. I have already spent $300 or more on the car. I have only one car, therefore, the time that it spends at the dealer, I have to make different arrangements, which includes borrowing a car from people, who end up without a car during that time. It is also very emotional to have to drive a car that can make you have an accident, that could cost my family, or myself our lives.",NA
"This is not a complaint about service. This is a complaint about the new auto styling concerning the narrowing of the height of car windows.  What on earth is going on? I'm buying a new car, and having a hard time choosing one, for one reason. I like to rest my elbow on the window ledge, and now it's too high. I really don't like this at all narrower window. Where is the joy of driving going?",NA
"I purchased a 2007 Jeep Liberty that has 3 broken windows. When I finally ordered the regulators, I received a message from the auto parts store. I was told that the order had been canceled because Jeep had just issued an order that said the regulators could no longer be sold due to a new and improved regulator that was now available. Only thing is, with the new part you have to replace the window as well. I asked the guy if he was seriously saying I needed to replace the perfectly good glass in 3 windows because JEEP came up with a new regulator that could only be used with a new window. 
      He seemed embarrassed, but said there was nothing he could do. Of course the regulator and window were a total of $300 or more. I guess too many people had started changing their own parts so they had to figure out a way to get a piece of the consumer. My windows are not operable. Please include me on any class action suit.",NA
"Rear drivers side window just fell down 2nd time. Dealer replaced the window and regulator on same window under warranty. Now they want to charge a diagnostic fee for something that is obvious. Had I known this, I would have never purchased the vehicle. I only hope I get better luck than some of the other people with this problem. My vehicle is at the dealer right now and I am going to show them all of these complaints. Why doesn't Jeep do a recall and fix this defect? This already has cost me a $60.00 diagnostic fee. Possibly, a couple hundred for a new regulator and window.",NA
"I have only owned my Jeep Liberty not even a month and while I was driving on the highway my window fell down. I am taking it in to be fixed tonight, but I almost was in a car accident due to the load noise it made when it fell. I was in rush hour traffic when this happened.",NA
"I have a 2006 Jeep Commander that is having a problem with stalling. I was riding down the road at 55 mph and the vehicle just quits on me. I have no power, vehicle is hard to steer. The vehicles behind me have to slam on brakes and run off the road to keep from hitting me. This is the second time this has happen in two months. I have taken my Commander to 2 different Chrysler dealership and they both say nothing is wrong with the vehicle. I have called Chrysler 10 times and no one has gotten back with me. I am afraid to drive this vehicle for fear that I may cause a major accident. Chrysler does not seem to care.",NA
"I am submitting this because I do not know in what direction to turn. I purchased a 2008 Jeep Commander on October 3, 2008. I average approximately 100 miles a day due to the requirements of my employment. Currently, there is 46,000 miles on my Commander. I first began to encounter problems with the vehicle around 42,000 miles. Engaging the key, there was a slight hesitation of 1-3 seconds prior to the engine turning over. This gradually began to progress to 5-10 seconds. It got to a point in which if I drove it, it would not start until it sat idle for at least 8-10 hours. Eventually, it would not start at all.
      I contacted Chrysler Jeep and was told that towing would be offered at cost to the consumer since it was past the 36,000 mile limit. My insurance company, Safeco, indicated that I had towing on my policy but it could only tow to a certified Chrysler Jeep dealership within a 15 mile towing radius. It was subsequently towed to the Thompson dealership since it met the criteria. The problem was diagnosed as being the wireless ignition module. I was charged $487.33, invoice #**. The vehicle ran good for two and a half weeks then began to exhibit the same problems. It eventually gave out. I started the vehicle and drove it to the Thompson dealership. It broke down there. After ""jiggling"" the key, it started and the service advisor, Richard, drove me home. This occurred on June 9. On June 14, I was informed that they could not find the cause of the problem. It should be pointed out here that my initial request was that if I was going to have a high end repair to notify me prior. I began to go online and found out the commonality of problems encountered by 2008 Jeep owners and was shocked. A recall of front control modules was often cited including the tendency for the vehicle to stall while driving. I contacted the lemon law attorneys but they would not accept because it was over the 36,000 mile limit. I contacted the Maryland State Attorney General's office and was transferred to the Consumer Protection Division. I submitted a formal complaint but was notified it would take 4-6 weeks in order for the division to respond. At this point, I was informed that they could only act as a inter-mediator.  I next contacted the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration. The procedure was duplicated. I submitted a complaint with a lag time of 4-6 weeks. I was assigned a Chrysler case manager, Andrew **. His solution was to get a second opinion. I asked, ""From who?"" If a certified dealership did not know the answers, who would? What were the logistics involved? Was I to tow the car from dealership to dealership at my expense? He said a member of their response team was to get back with me by June 16. It never happened. I called back the subsequent week and he was totally oblivious to the specifics of my case. He repeated that I needed to get a second opinion. It was at that time I requested another case manager. I was given an equally inept case worker, Kristy, **. She prompted the same response as the previous case worker but with a twist. The area district manager was to get in touch with me not later than June 29. To Chrysler's defense, they did offer to reimburse me for the front control module repairs. I have to submit my original repair documents and a determination then has to be made. I have a potential death trap. As with Toyota, I need to know how many people will needlessly have to be injured or killed before a class action suit will be initiated. The problems of the 2008 Jeep Commander are extensive and these have been documented. They are taking a lackadaisical approach when it comes to addressing the concerns of the consumer. I would imagine after they defaulted in the repayment of the $7 billion bailout, Chrysler would be more proactive in addressing the concerns of the consumer. I have a vehicle sitting in front of my place of residence. No one knows what's wrong with the thing. I spoke with the actual mechanic doing the repairs. He is really cordial and knowledgeable. He said that he has worked on the vehicle on his own time without pay. He said that he can run more extensive tests which would be costly and may not still yield favorable results. At best, he will trouble shoot or trial and error. I believe the problems are the result of faulty manufacturing. In some Jeeps, it was found that Chrysler installed faulty Mitsubishi starters. I need to emphasize, Thompson Chrysler Jeep and the service advisor, Richard **, as well as the mechanical have been superb. They are the only bright spots out of the whole ordeal. They couldn't have a more professional group of people representing the Chrysler logo; and Bruce **, who should be elevated to case manager. Much more personable than Kristy or Andrew will list my current case worker as the perpetrator, Kristy ** and Andrew **. I have no confidence in my Commander or Chrysler and will not ever buy a US vehicle again. Chrysler complaint no. **.",NA
"I just lost my third window. It fell into the door within 200 feet! This time I didn't even get a chance to tape it up! I will need to get ""the little piece in the door"" replaced again.

I will need to pay for another window repair with no guarantee it will not happen again. It’s like feeding popcorn to someone in a theater!",NA
"In 2006, I purchased a new Jeep Commander. Before the incident, which I will mention here, I often told people this was the best car I'd ever owned. I really enjoyed the 5.7L Hemi engine and 4-wheel drive with Quadra-Drive II transmission. I experienced one major problem though. In March 2009, when the Jeep was exiting the drive chute of the local car wash, one of the attendants jumped in and started the engine. Immediately, the vehicle surged forward. The attendant bailed out the open door, leaving the Jeep to fly forward. I literally mean ""fly forward"" since it hit a curb, jumped a foot or two high and flew over an adjacent depressed roadway. It was ""flying"" about eight feet vertically in the air and 39-feet horizontally before it landed on its rear wheels. 
      The car then continued unpiloted between two rows of parked cars in the parking lot of a restaurant at about 25-30mph for another 150-200 yards before knocking over a light standard and becoming stuck by straddling a raised earthen berm with all four wheels suspended. If the vehicle had not been stopped by the light standard and berm, it would have entered onto a busy 4-lane highway. The car wash attendant received minor injuries in the bailout. Fortunately, no one got in the way of the runaway Jeep or serious injury/death would have occurred. The Jeep was seriously damaged, including a bent frame, but ultimately repaired and I've been using it without incident since. I continue to enjoy driving my Jeep, but I am now leery of a repeat incident. I still love her, but I know that since she strayed once, she might do so again.",NA
"I took my '03 Jeep Liberty for a bad window regulator on 06/03/09. They failed to tell me about your complaint department and charged me $367.70 because the car had 56,411 miles then. On 02/10/10, the car went to Moore Jeep for same problem and was fixed under warranty with 57,456 miles then. (No charge to me). On 05/19/10, the car went to Moore Jeep for the same problem and was fixed under warranty with 57,923 miles now. (No charge to me). You can see the pattern here. I am wondering why this was corrected with 57,923 with no charge; 57,456 with no charge. And at 56,411 miles, Moore charged me $367.70. I don't know if Moore Jeep or Chrysler owes me. Someone owes me $367.70. Please contact me on how to expect payment. I have all this documented with my bills. If I can look this up online, I am sure you can too. Thanks again.",NA
"Windows on the 2007 Jeep Liberty are not working. The windows have to be replaced and cost a lot of money. That new vehicle shouldn’t have to have windows fixed this soon because of something the factory did. I’ve owned a Jeep for the last 6 years. I’ve bragged about mine to everybody. I have even encouraged a few people to buy a Jeep, but this is a rip-off. Everyday factory workers can’t afford over a thousand dollars to replace these windows.",NA
"I bought my 2006 Jeep Liberty used at 43,000. After driving it off the lot 5 days, a window regulator broke on it. Cost me over $300.00, which they told me I had to buy the window also. That was March 2009. So December 2009 a second regulator goes bad. The dealer tells me that they have had some problems with them and Chrysler will pay half. I was happy about that, but now 4 months later the window regulator breaks again. This time the dealer knows nothing and can't help me. 
      He doesn't believe that it has happened again but when I get there they bring a bulletin in that says it may be a recall soon, look at my car and then they send me home telling me I have to wait for a part. This is so wrong. They know it is faulty and should be paid by them, not me. They keep breaking every few months and it costs a bundle. I don't have $300.00 plus bucks to fork out every few months. Chrysler needs to step up and fix this problem! The consequence is a lot of money shelled out to Chrysler and I am sure they hike the repair costs up too.",NA
"A few months ago, my 2009 Jeep Liberty's tachometer surged to 2,000 RPM while stopped and foot on brake. This has happened four different times now while stopped and foot on the brake.

"On May 3, 2010, I was on my way home from work when my accelerator pedal stuck. I tapped it to get it unstuck which threw the car in super fast acceleration which careened my car over an embankment which only stopped when I hit a tree. I suffered a severe hematoma of the skull, concussion, severe bruising, which to this day I still have a black eye and suffer severe headaches. 
      The car’s air bags never deployed. The jeep overturned when hitting the tree. If these air bags had deployed, I believe I would not have sustained the trauma to my body, especially my head, as I did. Upon investigation, I see that the jeeps have had acceleration problems for years. I paid the consequences when my car’s accelerator stuck and on release threw me into an embankment. My head injuries were the worse. I still suffer from severe headaches. I lost a car, my air bags did not deploy, I lost 2 weeks of work of which I should have listened to my body and stayed off more, but economically I could not, especially having to purchase a car. I feel Chrysler/Jeep Corp. should be held responsible for this accident! Mentally, I have a fear of getting behind the wheel again even though this was not of my doing. I am extremely stressed over this situation and would like answers!",NA
"I have owned my 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport for almost 4 years. I have had to replace the motor on the rear windows 4 times. The rear driver side window 3 times and passenger side once. Although Jeep has picked up the cost one time, I have been responsible for the other times. I am currently in debate over this fourth window. I refuse to pay for it! My window is down and my car is not secure. It is over 100 degrees on a daily basis. My AC goes right out the window.",NA

"My 2007 Jeep Commander engine stalls out in the middle of driving and the service technicians claim to have no idea what is wrong with it or how to resolve.

This has not trickled down to my 2007 Commander yet.",NA
"My window regulator broke on my 2004 Jeep Liberty. Apparently this is a common problem. I was unable to buy the broken part anywhere, believe me I scoured. Why? This is because Jeep has redesigned the broken part, forcing me to buy new window glass. If their new design didn't go with the existing window, they should replace the window at their own cost. 
      They admitted their design was defective by virtue of replacing the whole system, that's their problem and shouldn't be mine. The dealer is charging me over $500, the broken part used to cost $80. I have no choice. The window broke and fell down into the door.I think we're ready for a class-action suit against Jeep. First, for making a defective part knowingly and then charging me for additional parts because they couldn't design it right the second time.",NA

It continues to stall, corporate customer assistance refused to discuss lemon law or arbitration or advise me on any other way to pursue the problem.

This has caused emotional stress, time to take car to dealer and financial obligation for vehicle with great potential for doing me bodily harm.",NA
"My 2005 Jeep Liberty was not starting. I turn the key and the dash lights would come on but no ignition. I thought perhaps it was the ignition switch. When my mechanic was disassembling my ignition, two metal pieces fell out of the switch. These pieces were the tip of the ignition rod the that fits into the ignition switch to turn the vehicle on. With this broken, the ignition switch can not be turned. The rod is approximately 3 inches long, very easy to access and easy to replace. 
      The only problem is that this part is not available. I have to buy the whole steering column for $374. This part is poorly made and appears to be a weak design. After investigating via internet, it appears to be a very common failure. I just wish that this part would be available or a new design made. As of now, I have to start my Jeep with a screw driver. I know it's not a safety issue but how does one go about getting a recall? Everything works on my steering column so I just think it is unnecessary to replace the whole thing. The part should be available!",NA
"I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty and have had to replace my window regulator switches about 8 times now and currently, I have two broken windows but was quoted $350, plus tax for each window to be replaced from Chrysler dealership located at Superstation Springs in Mesa AZ. As you can imagine, I don't want to pay $700 for something I know is just going to break again. I have asked them to ask the manufacturer for a discount. Basically, I don't feel that this part should continuously break and consumers should have to keep paying for something over and over and over again. I have owned my Jeep for almost 6 years now. Thank you.",NA
"I have been a loyal Jeep owner for ten years. This is my third jeep, and I love them, even though I could have bought another vehicle that had better gas mileage. In three years, I have had to take my 2006 Liberty into the shop 4 times for a bad window regulator on three different windows. Each time, I was covered under warranty. (I think Jeep knew this was a problem for many owners.) But now, I was told that it would cost me ""at least $470,"" and the guy never even looked at my car. 
      I told them that this particular window was already repaired, but he said I would still be responsible for the repair fee. I've been looking online, and there a hundreds of complaints about faulty window regulators. Chrysler is in the toilet right now, and they really can't afford to lose people like me. If there is a class action suit against Jeep, count me in. This should definitely be a recall. Shame on you, Chrysler. I will never buy another Jeep again.",NA

"We bought our 2006 Jeep Liberty Renegade under a year ago with 32,000 miles on it. Two days after driving off the lot, the rear driver side window went out. The dealership replaced this free of charge, which we are very grateful for. Now almost six months later, the passenger rear window has gone out. Right now, it is duct taped up to prevent rain and debris from coming into the jeep. However, we are not able to drive it anywhere because every tiny bump will knock it back down. I contacted Jeep and they seem willing to reimburse us, however, it's going to cost us anywhere from $350 on up to fix and this is out of our pocket. We are a military family and do not make that much to begin with. My question is why can't the Jeep dealer just fix it and discuss financial options within their own company? 
      I've read quite a bit on this issue on various consumer websites. Everyone is having this problem. It is a defect in the windows and Jeep should be made accountable for it! Instead, we are all paying out of pocket expenses, with a verbal agreement for reimbursement which who knows if we will actually get this. I really like my Jeep, however, with these little problems, I seriously doubt I will ever own one again.",NA
"I was driving my 2008 Jeep Rubicon on highway I96 about 25 miles south of Grand Rapids, MI. All of a sudden, I heard a ""whoosh!"" I stopped my Jeep. The driver-side, rear side window, which is part of the roof, popped off and shattered on the highway. A lost window is to be replaced. I lost faith in my vehicle. We bought an extended warranty. At first, the dealership wasn't going to replace the window because glass isn't covered under warranty. We argued and won. We now pay the $100 deductible. But I want to document this with someone. The window just popping off is a concern. What if someone had been beside my Jeep? It could have been fatal.",NA
"We purchased a new 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee and after we had about 35000 miles on it, we were driving down the expressway at 70 mph and the engine started to race to 7000 rpm, wna continued when the brakes were pressed.  I had to turn the key off and try to pull over with no power steering.  
      The dealers have never been able to find a problem and it has happened 10 to 15 times in many different cases.  Sometimes even when at a stoplight with foot on the break, it happens.  It sounds like the same problem that others have had.  There is no damage yet and I have been able to turn the engine off when it happens so far, but we will not sell this jeep to anyone because of this problem.",NA
"I had an unexplained acceleration on my 2007 Jeep Commander, with 6000 miles on it. The car was totaled. I'm alive, but terrified of driving. Multiple calls to Chrysler, denied me release of inspection reports. I was told that I would be provided same only by engaging an attorney or by virtue of my hiring an attorney. Everything I have read for the past number of days about Toyota, makes me convinced that I have been badly misled and hurt by Chrysler. Brand new car totaled. Damage to property. Extreme mental anguish.",NA

"My problem is with the manufacturer. I have had all four windows fixed under warranty. When the 5th window broke again, it was past the warranty. By the way, the 3rd and 4th window being fixed, the manufacturer sent an alert to dealers about how to fix the windows properly. This mean my first 3 windows were not fixed properly. 
      Anyway, I went around and around with the manufacturer rep (because he is only the speaker and can't negotiate) we got no where. To me, it's the principle of the matter to be fair. I have been a loyal customer of two jeeps. I guess my customer satisfaction is not worth paying to fix my window properly. I will never purchase another Jeep because of this experience.",NA
"Jeeps obviously have a window regulator problem. I have had two breaks on my Jeep already and there are many forums out there speaking about this as well as petition sites. I spoke to Jeep the first time and they paid half for a problem they caused. That is so unfair and now they want me to get the second window inspected at my expense for them to even talk to me. We all know warranty runs out and what it covers, but when a product is manufactured defective like this why can they not take ownership and fix it? The dealers will tell you there is a problem. I’m a frustrated Jeep owner.",NA
"When our vehicle was barely 3 years old and just past the warranty cut, the mechanism for our driver's rear window went out. It would no longer function or even hold in an upright position. The price to replace the mechanism was beyond our means, so we tied the window up. Then within a year, the rear passenger window also went out. Now a third window in our vehicle has given out. These are all clearly made with faulty materials but the company refuses to recall the part or repair it because it is out of the 3-year warranty zone.",NA

We had autozone reset it and when we unplugged and replugged the sensor it seemed to work fine. In the past two weeks, while stopped at a red light or stop sign, with my foot securely on the break, the jeep has suddenly accelerated and lurched forward. Each time has been a little worse.

This weekend, I was involved in a four car accident because the Jeep failed to slow down with me pressing on the brakes as hard as I could. I had not experienced any previous problems with the brakes and had just slowed down a minute or two earlier. Traffic slowed down and the car in front of me braked. I attempted to brake, pushing as hard as I could but my car did not slow down. The result was a four car chain reaction collision. I was charged with failure to slow down.",NA
"My parents bought me a demo 2006 Jeep Liberty in 2006 when I was 16. It had just under 500 miles on it. Within the first 6 months, the window made a grinding sound and then fell down. The dealership replaced it. Just shy of my warranty expiring, I had two more windows break in the same way. My father forced the dealership to change all of the regulators to ensure this problem wouldn't happen again. Just a few months ago, I had another window break. I was just out of the time warranty but under the mile warranty but that didn't help me. The dealership told me they couldn't fix it without ordering a new window, that cost me $400. They also charged me $182 for their service. 
      It was just under $600 for a problem that is widespread in all 2006 Jeep Liberties. The man working at the dealership told me this is a huge problem that Chrysler is ignoring. I am a college student, I can not afford to dish out $600 every few months to fix a poor-quality manufacturing part. Replacing the regulators is not working. I am living proof to that. Chrysler needs to recall this model and make.",NA
"Specifically, this is the worst Jeep I have ever owned and I have owned 4 other Jeeps. The light on the dash board that indicates problems with the tires stays on constantly. In fact, this past August I went for my yearly sticker and the intake worker, Courtney, at Grava Chrysler/Jeep said they could not give me a sticker unless I got two brand new tires for the rear. 
      Because the tire light was constantly on, I thought the new tires would correct the constant light. The car had about 21K miles on it. I don't drive all that much. I purchased the Commander for peace of mind in the winter months. The replaced tires were the original tires. So I paid $300.00 for two new tires to get a sticker and to hopefully make the dashboard light go out. I haven't gotten a mile with the new tires when the dashboard tire light turned back on. There is also a problem with the air conditioning motor according to Courtney at Grava Chrysler/Jeep. I have tried to have this problem rectified, but both times, Courtney told me the part was on order and she would call me when the part came in. When I checked back with her, the part hadn't come in and she stated that she would re-order it. I never got her call so my air conditioning/heating unit in the Commander still sounds like it has gravel in it. My most pressing problem right now is the on and off stalling of the engine. I can get in the car and start her up and drive to the store. I'll come out of the store and the car won't start. When this stalling occurs, it seems as though whatever was wrong corrects itself because the car will start after sitting for a couple of hours. Meanwhile, depending on where I am, I have to either walk home, have someone pick me up or take a taxi home leaving the car where it is. This has happened on numerous occasions and is still happening.In fact, when I go to the store, the doctor, etc. I either leave the car running with the doors locked so that I won't get stranded or I leave it home and take a taxi. The last car stalling event took place yesterday, 1/5/10. I took my grandson to school in Revere, MA., the next town over. The car started fine. But when I tried to start the car after dropping my grandson off, it wouldn't start. There I sat in 20 degree weather in a stalled car. I finally walked to my daughters house about a 1/4 mile away. I have called AAA on a couple of occasions when the car stalled. The tow truck driver said it's probably my starter. I recently read about the problems other folks are having with this stalling issue. Believe it or not, I thought I was the only one experiencing this problem. My Jeep has not stalled on me while I was driving. When I first got the car there was a seat belt recall, but that was completed.",NA
"The jeep windows drop and shatter; the cheap plastic parts they used will not hold up. I googled the problem, it is widespread. There should be a recall.",NA
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty had windows that fail to stay up and the regulator is bad. We had the rear windows (both) repaired sometime in middle of the year. Now, front driver window fell while I was driving down on the freeway to Sacto. Talk about a cold surprise! I stopped at my mom's house to try and fix with pliers and duct tape. I got the window up, but it was not fixed. I see forums about regulators failing at a regular rate. It seems to be a major flaw with the design and there should be a recall to fix massive problems with the windows. Where is product/manufacture value if it does not last?",NA
"This year alone I've had four window regulator replacements, on top of the long list of replacements I've already had. Both of my rear window regulators went out in February and were replaced. The rear driver one was replaced again around August. At this time, I was assured that the part problem had been fixed and there would be no further problems. Needless to say, I just had the forth replacement this December. Guess the problem isn't any closer to be fixed. I park on the street and the window regulators just break. My car is sitting out there with an open window, that I know nothing about until the next time that I go somewhere. 
      During the last repair, my service adviser asked how I liked my Liberty. My answer was I own a Jeep 4x4 that can't go off road because a window regulator will fall and I'll get another repair bill. What is the point of having a 4x4 that can only be on the pavement and even at that, the windows still give out? I believe that this last regulator replacement made number 12. When is someone going to hold Jeep accountable for this?",NA
"Today (Dec. 17, 2009) the passenger rear window on my 2007 Jeep Liberty fell. I am unsure if the regulator is broken. Tomorrow I will open the door and see the damage and try and replace it myself. After reading these posts, I am sure the regulator is broken, but I do not know if I will have to purchase the new style regulator. Is the old style still available to purchase? I'll find out. Well obviously, paying $400+ per window every time they fail (and they will fail) is unacceptable. Why can't we all just write one letter - everyone sign it who is having issues and send the letter to Chrysler/Jeep for resolution? If they do not, we all take them to court and force them to fix the issue. We can't simply allow them to continue to ignore this issue.",NA
"Two passenger regulators have broken on my 2006 Jeep Liberty. I am required to replace not only the regulators but the perfectly fine glass. Clearly Jeep has a design flaw with the glass/regulator system. Customers should not be forced to pick up the tab. The repairs are costing me over $400 per window! The regulators themselves are only about $150, but why I need to spend over $200 per window when my windows are intact is beyond me. I am paying over $800 to fix two window regulators and replacement glass as Jeep has changed the glass and regulator system of my 2006 Jeep Liberty.",NA
Electric window regulator is defective and has been a constant problem for thousands of Jeep owners. I just replaced mine for $357.08 at dealership.,NA
"Back in 2007, when my Jeep Liberty CRD diesel (a 2006 model) was under warranty,  the check engine light came off and some code was pulled from the computer about a problem with Turbo charger inlet pressure sensor. I was not told to replace anything and they blamed the computer for the problem. Now it's 2009 and I have my Jeep taken care of at the Bellevue, WA dealer and I have spent about $2000 already, replacing parts to fix the same issue that was coming up back in 2007. The problem is that, of course, my warranty has ended so I have to pay this all out of my pocket. I have receipts that state the computer in the car was coming up with the issue back in 2007. I think it's totally unfair. It was obviously something that came out wrong from the factory or that I could have fixed while under warranty.",NA
I just talked to a friend of ours who said her Jeep window will not go up or down. We have a Jeep Grand Cherokee that has 3 windows that will not go up or down.,NA
"We have a 2003 and a 2006 Jeep Liberty and both have had windows fall down due to the faulty regulator.  I called Chrysler when the second one occurred (just before Thanksgiving) and waas told I had to take it in to be ""diagnosed"" first, then I'd hear back from them in 24 hours.  So they force me to make 2 trips to the Jeep place since they wouldn't approve the repair on the spot.  Oh, and when they did call back, they want me to pay $150.00 towards the repair and they'll pick up the rest.  Chrysler needs to be sued as it is clear that they aren't going to voluntarily issue a recall.  And I am not even convinced that they have actually ""fixed"" the problem as there are people who have had the same window regulator replaced multiple times.",NA
"We bought our 2006 Jeep Liberty new in June of 2006.  This is an all-terrain vehicle that should hold up to about anything...So we thought.  Within the first six months we had to have the driver's side window repaired - the regulator.  A year later our second regulator went out on the rear drivers side.  Thankfully it was under warranty...but we now realize that it was fixed under the old way...and will probably go out again...and probably soon.  Six months ago and our mileage is at 39000 miles...3000 over the warranty...our 3rd window regulator broke...and since it wasn't under warranty anymore...and we were told, under the new redesign of Chrysler Jeep's initial design problem...we will have to not only replace the regulator but the perfectly good window as well...$460.00 out of our pocket...and in these times...money we don't have...and shouldn't have to pay to replace something that should last the life of the vehicle...this is ridiculous...a design problem that obviously they realized was a problem and are making the consumer (the ones that buy their vehicles) pay for.  And to top it all off...My fourth window regulator just broke tonight...less than 3 weeks before Christmas and I now have to pay for a new window.  We used to love our Jeep but have now decided that if this issue is not resolved and corrected by Chrysler Jeep, we will trade in our Jeep on a new (non-Chrysler) vehicle and will never buy one again...I would really like to continue buying Chrysler Jeeps, so please resolve this issue.",NA
Window regulator needs replaced on 2005 Jeep Liberty.  This is a manufacturer defect and a recall needs to be ordered for the thousands of consumers forced to spend millions of dollars in a repair that is clearly the company's fault.,NA
"An update on my post from a month or so ago.  When I called Chrysler customer relations, the gentleman was nice, I wasn't as pleasant after I was told the day before by Chrysler that a service warranty bought on my 2006 Jeep Liberty by the previous owner would cover the $365.  When I took my jeep into the dealer to fix the window regulator problem I was told it wasn't covered.  I asked to talk to the customer relations supervisor.  He told me that wasn't necessary and I said it was.   Surprisingly, I received a call back from the resolution dispute department the next day.  He told me Chrysler would reimburse me $130.  This tells me that Chrysler is making nearly $200 or more profit each time they replace the window regulator and a new window.  I received a call yesterday (December 3 )telling me that Chrysler is going to pay me $230, I need to call them back still.",NA

We purchased a brand new 2006 Jeep Liberty June of 2006.  Since then we have had to replace 5 window regulators.  Now that our warranty has run out of course the 6th one has now gone out.  I have been reading complaint after complaint on this website of coutless people going through the same thing.  It's an outrage.  This is a defect.  Jeep knows this is happening and has since corrected the problem but what about us who have to either try to never use our windows or pay outlandish prices every 6 months to fix yet another one that has already been fixed twice.  Why can't anything be done about this?,NA
"We bought a 2007 Jeep Liberty with less than 12000 miles on it for our daughter to take to college. We purchased it from a Chrysler/Jeep Dealer.

I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty new. I liked it until I had to bring it to replace the window regulators. I had to replace 2 of them the first year and one the second year. I saw a future of problems with the car after an additional 3 recalls. The reason I am complaining is about the window regulators. I found out nothing was done for the consumer even though the regulators keep breaking. I have a friend who also has the same issue. He has replaced 5 window regulators since he owned his Liberty. I think he is going to fill out this same form. His name is Robert Rivas.,NA
"I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty that I purchased used in February of 2008.  For the most part, I was happy with the vehicle to begin with.  Then My left rear window suddenly would not go up or down anymore.  I took it to the dealership and was told that it was the regulator that had broken and that it was not covered under any regulator.  So $233.00 with the part and labor included, it was fixed.  This was about a year ago.  Last week the right rear window did the same thing.  Since I did not have an extra $233 just lying around to fix it, I duck taped it so it would at least be closed until I could fix it.  Imagine that, Duck tape on a 3 year old vehicle!!!!!!!  Then yesterday, as I am looking for a second job to help pay for my vehicle expenses (I need 2 new tires as well), the right driver's side window does the same thing!!!  Only this time, I can't duck tape it because it is too heavy to stay up.  So, I drive to the dealership, which was closing in 10 minutes.  The guy looks at it and trys to get it to stay up at least until monday.  I ask about the price, just to see if it had changed at all since the last time I had this done. Turns out, the Jeep people decided that it was necessary to upgrade the regulator so it will not fit my current window.  So now, I have to replace the regulator and the window!!!  How much with that be?  $350 for parts and then another $200 for labor and taxes!  $550 just for the one window!  What the real kicker in all of this is, is the fact that the Jeep dealerships all say that this is a common problem in the Libertys.  However, there has been no recall or announcement of the defect by jeep.  So I'm supposed to just deal with every regulator breaking as it happens because Jeep made regulators that don't stand up to every day use????",NA
"I purchased a 2006 Jeep Liberty and we've had problems with the window regulators on all of the windows.  I noticed other Jeep Liberty owners on this forum have had the same problem.  My Jeep is in the shop this morning and they told me the same thing that the regulator has been upgraded and you need a new window to get the upgraded regulator. Chrysler hasn't heard the last from me on this.  It's going to cost more than $300 to repair.  There should have been a recall on this.

Is there going to have to be multiple deaths do to this problem?

"I purchased a 2006 Jeep Liberty in December of 2006... I'm gonna try to be as nice as I can. But within the first year the window regulator went out, it was replaced a few months later the second regulator went out and it was fixed then the third and it was fixed.  Now today 10/09 the first one has gone out again. And wouldn't you know my warranty is out.  I did purchase the extended warranty which will cover the regulator after a $100 ded is paid. But here is the kicker....Crysler has finally recongnized there is a problem and has redesigned the regulator, which now does not match up with the orginal factory window!!! and they will not cover it...They want the consumer who has taken off many hours of work drove 30 miles and wasted most of the day to have the other 4 fixed to pay for that window!!! Is Crysler a IDIOT!!!! or what.... I asked the service manager why do you think the redesigned the regulator and he said"" I assume it was because of all the problems and complaints""  Well you would think that if they redisigned the regulator they would eat the cost of the window  dud?  This is our government own Auto factory at work going to hell in a handbag!!!!! I am suprised anyone would buy a Jeep product if they read this web site.. I just got through reading at least 50 complaints with the windows and I stopped, there was 84 pages....

"I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty in February 2007 and little did I know I was fixing to have to spend a fortune replacing window regulators,after reading all these other complaints,I think I need to add my story.And also want to know why this is not a recall on this product,now days and time it takes all my money to make ends meet and now I am faced with replacing another regulator for the fifth time in two yr..First one went out in June 2007,I had it replaced at a local dealership for just over 500.00..That was hard to come up with,but I managed,okay thinking I would make the rest of the yr. without having to replace any more,wrong,July 2007 another one went out,so I go online and try to figure out how to replace them since it looked as if I was fixing to have to do this alot,all was well in the replacement of that one,was alot cheaper since I ordered the parts online.Mean time I still have a monthly note on this Jeep.2008 rolls around and in april another one goes out sitting in a parking lot and fell down.so here I go again,ordered more parts and replacement windows since I was told they changed the design to work with a certain window,more expensive but still cheaper doing it myself.lucked out in 2008 and only changed out one,2009 March here goes another one out,here I go again spending extra money on what seems like a default other than my own..And now sept.2009 am back to replacing the very first one I had replaced in 2007 at my dealership..It is obvious there is a very big problem here with these regulators,and so far it has cost me $1100.00,give or take a few bucks.Am fixing to order another one and the price of it from two yrs. ago has gone up 39.00..This is just a little something for Chrysler to chew on since they will not make a recall on thes Jeeps,one thing is for sure,as soon as I fix it I am fixing to replace the Jeep with another make and model..I will do more research this time so I want have this problem again..Thank you,Bobby",NA

I am concerned that when my warranty runs out, this will be a continuing problem. I had intended to keep this vehicle for the long term and am disappointed that Jeep does not seem to be concerned about this. This is potentially very costly. Is there any recourse for Liberty owners? I can see that this could potentially be a safety issue. One would think that Jeep would not treat this as lightly as they obviously are.",NA
"While stopped at a red light, the engine revved up and the car jumped forward, hitting the car in front even though I applied the brake. My Jeep Grand Cherokee suffered heavy front damage and the other car was badly damaged in the rear. Our insurance covered most of the cost.",NA
"I bought a new Jeep Liberty Sport 2002 in January 2002. Ever since I got this vehicle, until now, it's been one problem after the other resulting in my complete dissatisfaction. I thought I had purchased a new car, but I think I would have been better off buying a used car. I'm sure it wouldn't had been as much of a hassle as this new car has been. The biggest problem this car had (among many others) was right when I bought it. In California, the beginning of the year, it's rainy season. Well it turns out my car wouldn't stop completely on wet ground/pavement. It will slide forward and not only that, but it will fishtail meaning when breaking, it will go left and right. You can imagine how scary that is. 
      I've been almost involved in 2 accidents because of this defect - one driving on the street and one on the freeway. I went back to the dealer twice. I explained what had happened and on both occasions. I was told to come back when it was raining so they could see what I was talking about! Can you believe that? With all the frustration, I went back when it was raining and until then they agreed to fix it. I can't tell you enough how much of a nightmare my experience has been with this vehicle.",NA
"I bought a 2007 Jeep Liberty and have owned it one year. The window regulator went out, and now, they want to replace it at my cost. And the window too went out ($450). If this was faulty regulator (There are many postings.), why is this not a recall? I am 83 years old and felt this was a safe vehicle. The warranty wasn't good, up to 36000 miles; and now, I have 43,000. Is this a money-maker?",NA
"The other day, I was pulling out of the Neptune Post office parking lot. I had put my car in reverse to back out. When I put the car in drive, the engine revved up and it shot forward like a torpedo, broadsiding a parked car and starting to climb an embankment. The police officer accused me of lying, and issued me a careless driving summons. My airbags never opened. I had scheduled an appointment to have my Jeep's electronic system checked because my power windows and locks were working off and on, and the interior lights would not go off automatically. After looking at all the postings on this sudden acceleration, I am sure that my Jeep had malfunctioned. How can I prove it though?",NA
"Well, I have a 2008 Jeep Liberty and it came to my surprise of only having it 18 months, the driver's side window wouldn't go up. I couldn't believe it. I took it to the dealership who said it will cost $270 to fix. I said, ""Oh my gosh, I can't believe it. It's just a 2008 model. I expect it to last longer than this."" Anyway, I'm still going around with the regulator not fixed. Could I sue the company if something awful happens? If Chrysler knew about this, why don't they fix it or recall them especially when someone gets a new one? This is ridiculous.",NA
"I own a 2002 Jeep Liberty. The window regulators have to be replaced almost every year. I took the vehicle in to two different dealerships when it was under warranty and they said no problem found. Since the warranty has been out, I have replaced four or five times now. This is a very dangerous situation because the window just falls - if you're going down the road, it is startling and the thump thump of the rear tires can really hurt your ears. When this happens, the car is not secure and you must have it fixed immediately.",NA
"This problem is all over the internet. The 2004 Jeep Liberty started having problems with windows falling down within one year of purchase. It has been ""fixed"" at least once a year or more since then. Last time, it was only six months. This is unacceptable to me as I purchased a new vehicle to minimize the occurrence of vehicle failure and unforeseen interruptions of use. When this occurs, vacations (road trips) are ruined. Rain and other weather enters the vehicle. It cannot be secured and you have to drive around, unable to secure your vehicle. It is difficult even to drive home on the freeway but also unsafe to take side streets, etc. during evening hours. It is basically just a pain and I do not understand how, in five years, Jeep has not been able to figure out how to solve this problem. It is like an additional source of income to them, so I guess they have no reason to.",NA
The window regulators keep breaking and needing to be replaced; I have replaced 5 regulators (all rear window) between April 2007 and Aug 2009.,NA
"Two weeks ago, body control module and two window modules went out at once, $1,800 to fix all three. Had no warranty, and insurance won't cover. We will never buy a Dodge/Jeep again.",NA
I have a 2003 Jeep Liberty. I am about to replace the window regulator for the 4th time on the rear back window. I have also replaced the right rear back window twice. The Chrysler dealer has admitted this is a defect in the car. What recourse is there? Each replacement is about $350.00.,NA
"I purchased my 2007 Jeep Liberty on June 8, 2009. I have had it for 7 weeks and I just had to replace the driver side window regulator at a cost of $340.00. You not only have to replace the regulator, but also the window. If I would have known about this problem beforehand, I would not have purchased a Jeep. I thought I did all my homework before buying it. I guess I didn't. To some this might not seem like a lot of money, but it put a big dent in my budget. I am now afraid if and when the others go, I will not be able to afford to have it fixed. Why has this not been recalled?",NA
"I have a Jeep Liberty 2005, and it only has 71,000 miles. And now, I need a new transmission.",NA
"We have had a lot of problems with this Jeep. You can stop for a red light and when you try to go, it will start to cough and sputter. If you turn it off and restart, it will be okay. It has done this since about 19,000 miles. It is a standard 6-speed transmission. I have 41,000 miles and it is starting to act like it doesn't want to go in gear. My son bought the same model 2 weeks after me and he had the same problem until it wouldn't go into 4th gear. Just had to have the transmission rebuilt.",NA
"I am currently in the process of replacing my second window regulator within one month. The driver side window regulator was replaced first, and now, I need to replace the front passenger window regulator. The cost for each of these repairs is around $300 each. I am wondering why no recall has been issued by Daimler Chrysler because, as I have found out, this is a very common problem. This is an extreme cost that should be fixed for free by Daimler Chrysler and not the automobile owner. I would greatly appreciate any information and updates relating to the window regulator issue that you can provide me with.
      To date, I will have incurred approximately $600 in costs, not to mention the shock/surprise when my windows just ""fell down"" when the regulators went bad. This is especially inconvenient during summer time when the outside temperature is very high and the air conditioner is cooling the outside and not the inside of the car because of the open window.",NA
"All four regulators have went bad on my jeep, along with two electric fan relays. How many more complaints are needed to get a recall on this matter? I have always been a Jeep lover, but is it really worth it? $350.00 per each window is **!",NA
"My 2006 Jeep Liberty window regulator broke again. I have had all the windows fail and some have been repaired two times. Now, I have to pay $100 deductible per window. They will not waive the fee. They said it is written in my extended warranty contract. However, I already had it repaired and the repair failed. I have been trying to get this fixed for over two weeks. Now, I have been told they are fixing it a new way, so that tells me the original part failed. The first replacement failed and now they are replacing the glass. Can you say defect? My dealer closed and the place I was sent to for service dose not do anything for me. You can tell they do not want me there because I did not buy my car there. I called Chrysler everyday on my way to work. My open case is now about 14 pages long. Chrysler told me that they do not have any parts contracts at this time and do not know when they will have it. Therefore, I am paying $400 a month to drive a car with a taped window. I cannot lock the car because you can slide the window down. I do not feel safe in the car at night in parking lots or stopping at red lights. Chrysler said my safety is not a recall reason or a concern for them. See if I make my payment this month.",NA
"On February 2, 2009 while traveling out of town, my 2007 Jeep quit shifting. It would not shift out of first gear. The problem is the front module had to be reprogrammed. A computer chip lost communication with the electric gear shift module according to the dealer. I found out from the repair dealer that the reprogramming could have been done prior to the car break down and that the manufacturer was aware of the problem on Jeeps. I questioned why this was not a factory recall issue. The dealer stated since it was not considered a safety issue, it was not a recall. Not a safety issue? What is safe about one's car suddenly not shifting from first gear? This could result in a collision. 
      I had to pay for towing to a repair dealership, a hotel, and a rental car to use while it was fixed. I feel the manufacturer should notify consumers about a problem like this so it can be addressed prior to drivers being stranded on the side of the road. The total cost of towing and car rental came to $154.22. It would be good customer service if Jeep would reimburse me. The situation was preventable with a simple notice in the mail that the module needed reprogramming. I would appreciate hearing from Jeep on this issue. Thanks.",NA
"I have had my Jeep 2004 Liberty's window regulator replaced now for the 5th time. This time when it broke, it even took out the lock mechanism. The car is out of warranty, but for the past 3 years every summer, I have had to replace at least 1 regulator. Last year, it was 3 of them that went bad. I have called Chrysler/Jeep multiple times and they always tell me that they are not aware of any problems. They are able to lie through their teeth every time about it. If there are no problems, then why is there a freaking backlog on inventory for this part for the whole nation? According to the dealer, it is going to take them a while to even get the part. Currently, they had to manually lift the window up and duct tape the entire window so that it will not go down. The downside to that, beyond how cheap of a temporary fix it is, is that the door will no longer open either now. So I have now a door that will not open and ugly looking duct tape all around it. 
      On top of all of this, they are forcing me to pay for the repair that they know is going to break again. How is that even fair? I own 2 vehicles from Chrysler currently. My PT Cruiser from 2001 still has had no problems. Why can't they just use the same regulator used in those vehicles on the jeep or at least something made the same way. I can guarantee that I will never by any vehicle made by them again. My Chrysler was made in Mexico, while my Jeep was made in Detroit. No wonder they went bankrupt when they can't even fix a single item that so many people are having issues with.",NA
"I had to replace driver's window regulator for about $500. Yesterday, while driving, I heard a thump and the passenger window slipped down into the window well.",NA
"I purchased a 2003 Jeep Liberty with 4000 miles on it in 2004 from a Jeep dealership, Global Auto Mall. All the problems started at around 60,000 miles. First, the exhaust manifold cracked; then at 80,000 miles, the whole top end of the engine needed to be rebuilt. Now, the passenger side ball joint failed (mind you, after a recall they had a while ago), which I had replaced at the dealer. I am very lucky that I was not going that fast when it happened. I could have been in a serious accident.",NA
"My clutch pedal stopped working on my 2007 Jeep Compass while I was driving on Friday, June 26, and I had it towed to the nearby Central Avenue Chrysler Jeep Dodge (It is manual transmission and cannot be operated without a clutch). They found a cylinder to be defective, empty of fluid, and ordered replacement parts. As of July 6, I am still without my car -10 days - and they refuse to provide me with substitute transportation, saying that Chrysler requires the additional extended warranty to be purchased for such coverage (My car is under 30,000 miles and still under the original warranty). This has cost me hundreds of dollars in transportation costs and lost work hours!",NA
"My husband is a mechanic. He and his employer, Alan **, were trying to maneuver a Jeep Liberty into the work stall from the parking lot. The Jeep had a broken ball joint and would not steer, so my husband was guiding it with a floor jack while Alan was gently giving the vehicle gas to slowly move it forward and into place, so it could be worked on. The Jeep suddenly shot forward under full acceleration on its own, while Alan literally stood as hard as he could on the brake. The vehicle left a long black skid line behind it where the back tires were trying to brake, but the front tires were continuing to accelerate. My husband was hit and dragged fifteen feet then crushed against an upright support.
      My husband is currently hospitalized. He has a broken nose, broken collarbone, four broken ribs and a broken ankle. We don't know how long he will be hospitalized, and we're looking at a long recovery time during which he will be unable to work. It is a workman's compensation claim, which will cost his employer and which will cost us time and effort to pursue. Meanwhile, I don't know how we will meet our financial obligations and Alan **, who was behind the wheel, is under examination regarding the incident.",NA
"From 5/20/08 until 12/04/08, I have seen them four times involving my driver's side door. They replaced the door latch two times and charged me overall close to $400. I have had a compression fracture in my back and Willie Racine's is over two hours away for me to get to. Having to climb over the passenger seat every time I get in and out of my jeep has been a real problem. Recently, in February, I had my spine fused. Approximately three weeks ago (June 16), my door started to seize up again. I cannot drive to Burlington at this time, let alone, very much and having to now climb over the passenger seat once again has become ridiculous. 
      I called Jeep and they said ""I just don't know what is going on with that door"", ""bring it in and we will take another look at it"" to which I replied, ""I can't, I am too far away!"" I was charged $30 by McNeil's Auto Center to get the door to open, $65.00 for the part that we need for the door and that isn't including labor! I have spent over $400.00 on my door at the Jeep dealership where I purchased my jeep and I am about to spend another $150.00 for someone else to put the new part in and the cost of the part. This is totally ludicrous!",NA
"I have had two automatic windows go out at an expense of $300 each so I called Jeep! Their service dept simply stated that I did not have an insurance. Now, a third window is out. Why have they not sent a recall for the constant problem? It costs $300 to replace a piece of plastic inside the door that should never have failed in the place!",NA
"I have a grey  Chrysler 300 basic model 2.7liter v6 engine. All my lights on the dash board came on. I took it to the dealer. They said they did not see anything. Okay, I took the car back home next day. For the second time, the car shut off in the middle of the street with my kids in the car. I was very afraid. I had to call my husband. He came half an hour later. The car started back up but all the lights was still on. I called the dealer and they told me to bring it the next day. The lady at the dealer that put the number tags in the car got in the car with me and saw the dash light up. So they kept the car again. They called me back again and told me to come get the car. Again, they still don't see anything. They drove the car for 8 miles, nothing.
      I picked the car up that afternoon, drove of the lot lights and the RPM went crazy. Now I'm turning right back around. They told me again to come back in the morning to go out in the field with the technician. Now, the tech has the machine on the car driving around did not go not even two blocks, the lights and RPM went crazy but it's not showing up on the computer. They kept it again. Two days later, they called me back and said it was my aftermarket alarm that was the problem. I drove home no problem. Second day, Monday morning, lights and RPM, also the engine don't sound right and now the engine light is on. On Monday morning, 6/22/09, I took the car right back to the dealer. The technician said he do not know what's wrong and he did everything to the car. Now I don't know when I'm going to get my car back. I have kids to take care of and have no transportation. I'm financially very low to keep maintaining rentals. They had my car about five times. They blame my aftermarket alarm. Now, the car has no alarm park in the streets. The seller is not happy. They're trying to get me in another car and to get me to put more money down on a new car. That's not right. They have no answer on my car and I need help.",NA
"I bought and serviced my Jeep religiously at the dealership. I was having drivability issues and brake problems. It was supposedly serviced and the problems returned. My last visit, I was furious. My Jeep was blowing through stop signs, the brakes weren't reliable. I received a quote for rotors after leaving the vehicle for 24 hours for diagnosis. It had 18000km. I felt something wasn't right and seek service elsewhere. The two inside brake pads were incorrectly installed, right side on left wheel, left side on right wheel. The rotors were replaced at my cost. The front wheel bearing hubs, front axle seals and rear pinion seal failed shortly after, they were replaced under warranty. That was at 20,000km.
      Now, the sway bar connects have been replaced. The clutch, pressure plate, release bearing, pilot bearing have been replaced at my cost. The transmission is not functioning well and the rear axle seals show signs of leaking (I had the seals inspected twice, they were never replaced). I guess 20,000km of intermittently pushing the inside brake pads have diminished all the other drive line components, some to the point of failure. The customer support individual I contacted stated there was no power train issues. As a result, I asked for an email, document reflecting that none could be provided. No money in good work.",NA

I took it to the dealership once and was fixed after 2 days although I let them know this was my only vehicle and that I needed it ASAP. Customer service was poor, I have been having issues with my brakes as well. It seems like it takes a while to respond. I took it to have an oil change and had them check my brakes and they stated they were okay. My driver's window fell off and when I called to see if they would repair it, they told me my warranty had expired at 36K miles, it's 38K. I was furious. The thing is if they know that this particular cars are having issues with the windows, the least that they can do is extend this warranty and do some checkups every so often. I'm so unsatisfied. As soon as I can, I'm getting rid of this car.",NA
"Maybe I should be writing what hasn't gone wrong with my jeep. The passenger side window switch will roll the window down but not up, the transmission has locked up at 50K miles, the wheel bearings went out at 38k miles and now, it sometimes stalls when sitting in traffic. I really feel like letting Jeep have it back. If Chrysler made better quality cars then maybe they wouldn't be bankrupt!",NA
"I leased a 2006 Jeep Liberty, originating from a dealership in Louisiana, currently registered in California. I had the vehicle serviced at a Los Angeles dealership in July, 2008 and had an air compressor replaced under warranty. The vehicle lease included a 3-yr, 26,000 basic warranty. The Jeep now has $53,000 and during a routine oil change and tire replacement, the technician stated there seemed to be something wrong with the transmission fluid, it was ""unusually black"" for a car with low mileage. I called to make an appointment at Midway Jeep in San Diego and spoke with Pat Twist, service advisor. They have informed me since that there is metal in the transmission fluid and it will cost me $750 for them to do the tear-down just to see what the problem is. I called the Jeep main line and they said they would pay for the tear-down, then negotiate the fee for repair, assuming the transmission has a defect. Now the dealership has informed me I am responsible for the cost of tear-down, then paying an ""unknown fee"" for repair.  The lease on the Jeep end on January 1st 2010, therefore in 6 months the vehicle will be returned to Chrysler. The vehicle rightfully belongs to Chrysler, they are the lien holder, I do not feel I should pay for their faulty transmission then return the vehicle in six (6) months.",NA

"It happened shortly after purchasing my new 2007 Jeep Commander. It would give a hesitation while sitting at a stop light or while in park like it was about to die. It would also rev up the engine like it was accelerating. We took it in a few months after we bought it. They said they found nothing wrong and did nothing at that time. It continued to do it, but we just put up with it because we figured we'd hear the same thing (it doesn't happen every time we drive it, just periodically). So now, it's doing it more intensely. It's as if someone is mashing on the gas pedal while in park and also at stop lights while I have my foot on brakes. Once, it has jumped forward and I thought I would hit the car ahead of me.

"My husband and I were hit from behind by an out of control 2004 Jeep Liberty yesterday.  The Jeep was 2 cars behind us, swerved around one car at high speed and plowed into the back of our moving car at about 60 miles an hour.  We were pushed by this car for 1 1/2 blocks, at which time it veered to the right, taking out a utility pole and only coming to a stop after it hit 3 cars in a used car dealership.  The woman driving the Jeep stated that her brakes would not work and the car was clearly accelerating despite her attempts to stop.",NA

                                        My husband and I purchased two (2) 2008 Jeep Commanders, several weeks apart, from Toms River Auto Mall Route 37 East, in Toms River, NJ. There have been no issues with my husbands Jeep; however, mine has suffered a myriad of malfunctions since the date of delivery. These have included the front driver and passenger power windows, alarmingly loud rattling from both front doors and dashboard, a section of the rear bumper detaching and hanging off, the rearview mirror needing to be fixed ; and most recently, starting the car this morning, and discovering that neither the heat nor the radio were working.
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                         
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        Following the first three returns to the dealership for the above problems, I suggested that the lemon law might apply. I was told by the service manager, that it would not, as the law refers to a single problem that, following three attempts at repair, cannot be resolved. I cannot imagine that the law will not cover the purchase of a vehicle that continues, over the course of a year, to break down, piece by piece.
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                         
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        I have made an appointment yet again, with the dealer for this coming Saturday, January 24, 2009, to investigate the cause of the heater and radio failure. I have grown weary of these frequent trips to the dealer. As of this date, my vehicle has less than 9,000 miles on the odometer. I am hesitant to drive it any distance, as I am fearful of these continuing malfunctions.
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                         
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        The Jeep name has always been associated with words like rugged?, durable?, and reliable?.

"MY sliding roof is making excessive wind niose when driving 50 and above on the expressway.  It is so loud you can not hear the radio or another person talking without yelling.  I did take it to the dealership, but the service manager said that its the characteristic of the slidiing roof.  As I was doing some other research, I have also discovered that others with the sliding roof are having the same problem.  I would love to give this car back, but it is a lease.  If this problem is not fixed, I will propably not ever by a Chrysler product again.",NA
I drove my new jeep through some water less deep than the recommended height by jeep and at walking pace along with a number of other vehicles ( on my local road home ) the jeep died half way through and the garage say it is my fault as water splashed up the front of the car. In fact the jeep trail rating procedure shows jeeps fording water up over the bonnet so how can the garage say its my fault?,NA
I find it ridiculous that jeep has not had a recall on its exhuast manifolds for the 98 Jeep TJ model.  I have just recently installed another new exhaust manifold and this is literally number 4 for manifolds.  Obviously there is a defect but Jeep/Chrysler will not recognize it as defect and manifolds are anything but cheap!,NA
When we purchased our vehicle it was not disclosed to us that the key system had changed. My husband wanted a spare key for his car and  when we went to the hardware store we were told that they could not do this any longer and it would cost me $140 and up for a new ket from the dealer. I honestly feel this new safety chip issue is just another way for car corporations to make a buck off consumers. I used to be able to make a spare key for a couple of bucks  a few years back and now it costs a couple of hundred?!?! Where is the justice?,NA
"I was driving to work one a few days ago when I noticed that my rear driver side window was down.  I tried to get it to go back up.  Fortunately, I am able to push the window back into place as the vehicle is parked, but once I begin driving, the window slides back down a couple of inches.",NA
"Recently, my low coolant warning light was appearing. I did not see any apparent leaks and just refilled it to full level. That was then followed by the oil pressure gauge dropping down to near zero when at idle or just slowing down. It would rise up again during acceleration but not to normal status. After bringing it to a local reliable repair shop he discovered coolant mixed in with the oil and that it would ultimately cause damage to the main bearing, if not already damaged, resulting in a major overhaul or a new or rebuilt engine ($3,500.00).

"I have a 2005 jeep liberty. Since I have owned it i have had the same problem with it many times.  When I first got it it was in the shop a few months later.

Also the canister and the solenoid were replpaced.  on 8-25-06 it was in the shop again for nvld canister, vent valve solenoid circuit high and once again  a vaccum leak.  on 08-31-2006 it was in the shop for valve on natural vaccum leak and a leak in the emissions system. for the last few years my malfunction light comes on for weeks and then goes off. now it is on and it continues to stay on.

"I purchased a 2002 jeep liberty (used) in early spring 2004. It ran well until the end of November. Then whenever I drove it until the engine reached temperature it would die at an idle state. It would restart but it would die again if I was not able to give it gas. I have had it at several mechanics. They have no idea why it does this. They have tried everything. Chrysler dealership had it for almost 2 weeks and said they could not find anything wrong. Driving it home from there it died. I do not think quality motors is to blame but I think they knew they had a lemon vehicle. 
      I have called Chrysler corp. and they said to take it to another dealership and call them from there. In order to do this I must have it towed about 30 miles and pay for it. This has cost me a lot of money by not being able to go anywhere I want and to go, where and when I need. I am always afraid it will die and not start again. What I do not understand is that no one seems to know what to do. This vehicle could cause an accident very easily by stalling. That is why I do not push the idea of traveling very far.",NA
We purchased a used vehicle (2005 Jeep) for my daughter. I have experienced the sudden acceleration that launches the vehicle forward when your foot is on the brake. The only way to stop it is to turn the car off. Today I almost ran into a medical center. I have had it in once and CarMax said they could not find a problem. Today I had it towed and they can keep it!!!!! That car is going to kill someone!!!!!,NA
"My mother owns a 2004 Jeep Liberty Sport 4x4 which I drive daily. We purchased it used at 38,000 in excellent condition from a local dealer. We had purchased an extended warranty from her credit union. At 67,000 miles approx. without warning, meaning no lights came on to indicate any problems, the Jeep began sounding like the engine was knocking, like a 1970's hotrod missing most of its oil. I immediately pulled over, called my garage and had the Jeep towed. Long story short. Jeep would not cover the problem. 
      The problem, ALL THE LIFTERS WERE BAD!! I had every record of service on this Jeep. I changed the oil every 3,000. I did everything they required per their recommendations. This should have still been under the 70,000 mile drive train warranty. They of course said it was not, refusing to pay or speak to me any further. Thank God I had talked my mom into getting extended warranty. We had to fight them, but I had proof that I had taken excellent care of the Jeep and maintained excellent service on the Jeep and it was of no fault of ours, but a defect with the vehicle. The cost was in excess of $2300.00. Now I am having issues with the heating system!!! The Jeep is sucking down coolant almost daily; it does not leak, just drinks it! Again, not over heat light, the temp. gauge reads normal, all of the hoses are in good condition, and the thermostat does not need replaced. I am out of ideas. If my mom was not in debt for this piece of ** I would have her trade. I would hate for someone else to get our problems. We still have problems with the front suspension even after they did the recall, when it is cold the front end squeaks, moans, and groans every time you go over a parking bump, you think it was a 100 yrs old. This started right after they did the recall replacement. Thank you for allowing me to vent. I realize in no way this helps my situation, but sometimes, it is nice just to speak your mind.",NA

My second window regulator has failed in a car under 5 years old. It is obibously a design flaw that Crysler is unwilling to admit to. I was charges $100.00 more for the part this time than last. We are all feeling inflation but that is robery.,NA
"I own a 2007 Jeep Commander Limited with 5.7l hemi purchased new in September 2007. In October 2008 I began to experience sporadic engine stalling and bucking problems. The stalling occurred while at a stop, travelling at highway speeds with loss of all power, or while driving down the street. This situation could cause accident, injury, or death. Initially thought it might be contaminated gas, but problem persisted. Took it to the Jeep Dealer on November 24, 2008. Their diagnostic test did not pick up anything but based on their online research saw others experiencing similar problems. The dealer implemented Chrysler Star solution # KO5558363. Picked up the Jeep and it stalled within a few blocks of the dealer. Returned the Jeep to the dealer on December 2 (after Thanksgiving Holiday) and called Chrysler Service and received a Reference Number. Since December 2, the dealer has attempted each of the following which have all failed to fix the problem, 1)Replace ignition switch, 2) Added insulation to cables leading to engine control unit to shield against an electromagnetic field thought to be disrputing signals to/from ECU, 3) Replaced ECU, 4)Replaced airflow sensor based on diagnostic messages indicating this may be a problem, 5) at request of Chrysler, dealer went back over all cabling, connections and diagnostics. All of the preceding attempts failed to fix the problem. The vehicle is still at the dealer. Their next attempt will be to look at a potential wiring harness defect.",NA
"The window regulator in my 2006 Jeep Liberty has been repaired three times on the passenger window on the driver's side.  In addition, I have had the driver's side window repaired for the same reason.  I am being told the plastic regulator snaps causing the window to drop and the motor will no longer function to put it up.  As the passenger window is never and I stress never used I feel this is a flaw in the design.  I was told the regulator in the past was made of metal and now has been replaced with plastic.  If it gets cold (note I live on the Western Slope of the Rocky Mountains, cold is inevitable)this part will snap.  It is troublesome enough to have to be inconvenienced with having to take my wehicle to the shop, I am now inccurring charges for this replacement as the vehicle has 51,000 + miles and I am only helped by having the extended warranty with a deductible.  I feel I am being unfairly charged for a inadequency of the performance of this tough wehicle.",NA

A few months later the rear differential goes. So we replace that, another couple hundered. Between then and a few months ago I havent had much problem. Every once and a while IT wont start.

"I bought a new 2006 Jeep Liberty on November 28, 2006. Since then the window regulators have broken SEVEN times. Each of the four windows have been affected, replaced, and are breaking again with the replacement parts.

I have taken my 2007 Jeep Commander 3 times to a 5 star Daimler Chrysler dealer for engine repairs. My jeep is also turning off while I am driving. The response I received from the service manager (Dave **) was that there are no reported incidents like this on this vehicle. I was never told that they are aware of the problem and there is a dedicated team working on it. I also reported to him that I was nearly in a car accident due to this. I was driving on the parkway @ 65 mph when my engine completely stopped. All he did was shake his head and state that hopefully they could fix the problem. Well the problem is not fixed and I nearly was in another accident. Do you have any updates on the investigation? Can this car be considered a lemon by law? Please contact me @ above #.,NA
"This is the third or fourth time my vehicle has been brought in for the same problem. Each time it's for the ABS/BAS and ESP lamp coming on. The dealer said the codes are stored, but must be Active to locate the problem. My concern is the lamps come on while driving on the highway at 50-60 mph. I've written to Department of Highway Safety twice and filed a complaint. Tonight, I wrote to Chrysler and Car Survey.",NA
"I have a 2005 Jeep Liberty. I was driving with the windows up and heard a pop sound and the left rear window was down and the regulator is broken. I really can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars to fix this problem, so I have my windows help up with cardboard. I am afraid to park anywhere because the window is not secure. I've seen that many people have had this problem and I think Jeep should be responsible for paying for the repairs. My warranty was just up in May of this year and since then, I also had the A/C break and now I need a new transmission cooler which the dealer said is not covered under the powertrain warranty. I purchased this car because of its reputation as being dependable and sturdy, and it is falling apart after 3 years.",NA
"I have a 2004 Jeep Liberty that I have had for only a year and a half. I am on top of this car with everything that sounds fun or even looks funny. One day leaving the gas station I go to lower my driver side window when suddenly I hear a big pop and my window isn't moving at all. I took it to the Jeep dealer and they told me it was a window regulator.
      OK no problem. I figure I'll pay about 200 bucks and have it fixed. Well I was in for a big surprise. The part itself cost $329 bucks, $48.15 just to look at it, and another $175 bucks for labor. $552.00 to fix the window are you kidding me??? Why hasn't there been a recall on this. I have seen many complaints ONLINE and a couple of people that I know have all had the same problem around the same time I have. RECALL PLEASE!!!!!!!!!",NA
"I bought my 2006 Jeep Liberty used in January. While at the dealership my son and I were told that the Jeep had a warranty and to call Jeep and have it transferred. We were told that by the salesman and the guy who did the loan papers. I called Jeep and was told the only warranty that the Jeep had was a body warranty for the paint and what not. So, of course, I did not get that transferred. The low-lifes at the dealership lied to me. Well, as time went on the instrument panel lights, one at a time, flash on and off. My rear passenger window will no longer function and I shoved door stops in it to hold it up. And last but not least, so far, sometimes she will not start. I feel like I was lied to and taken advantage of. 
      I feel like this is fraud. I purchased a vehicle under false pretenses. Anyway, as you all know - Jeep and the dealership don't care. So now, I have 5 years to pay on a piece of crap while trying to work full time, part time, go back to school and raise a teenager on my own. I hate Jeep and they should pay for their deception and lack of care. All I pray for now is to get out of this payment and away from this vehicle. Heck, I can get a loan for 3 grand and buy a clunker down the road and have less drama. Oh, and the ding I hear constantly going off while driving is going to make me snap (forgot to mention that earlier). Thank you for listening or should I say reading. I feel a bit better. Good luck to you all.",NA
"I bought the Commander as a demo as told to us by the salesperson, but it actually turned out to be a rental that was turned in that I found out later on Carfax. Since day one, the car has been a nightmare--warped rotors, does not start every 2000-5000 miles, electrical just stops working, including radio, interior and exterior lights, battery, and it occasionally stalls. The car has been in the shop at least ten times but the problem keeps returning. I went on the NHTSA web site and saw that this car has over 300 complaints, including many where the car stalls at high rates of speed. I am terrified to drive it. 
      The dealer will only give me 13500 on my trade, but I owe 18,835. I saved to buy this car and there is no way I can take a hit this size. So I have a $456/mo payment, plus $110 for insurance, and I wont drive the car because it is not safe. Also, I am told that because there is a recall on the car, I just have to keep bringing it back to get fixed--I don't have a lemon law claim because Jeep acknowledged the problem.",NA
"Sentry Key Immobolizing System. The idea what to prevent theft. My truck thought that I was trying to steal my own truck. I have all of the original keys, and apparently sometimes those original chip keys go out. Therefore my Jeep could no longer read the original key and it has locked itself using the S.K.I.S. I have to pay $100 for a tow company, then fork over $90 to the dealership to have it analyzed. 
      Then they have to re-set the truck, $125-$325. After that it is going to cost me $50 to have new keys made. And I thought that only people with lost keys have new keys made. I was told by Jeep that sometimes these things happen, and if I wanted my truck to start again then I had to take it to the dealership, and have it reset by them. what a rip off! I am a poor college student who cannot afford to pay all of these extra non-mechanical mishaps. I am a girl, who found out how to fix my Jeeps alternator by buying a book and fixing it myself. I saw that there was some kind of lawsuit going on about this because studies have shown that this S.K.I.S does nothing to prevent theft!

"We bought a 2006 Jepp liberty because we were able to greenslip it. It has been the worse purchase that we have ever investied in. There was a problem with the interior seats staining from rain water. We tried and tried to get this fixed. They only response was we know there is a problem with stainig but there is nothing we can do. This was from the dealer and Jeep itself. 
      Then about 6 months ago the motor(regulator) in the window broke. It was $350 to fix. Now the other rear window has the same problem. We were told that they know that there is problem with the window tracts thta causes extra pressure on the window and the motor and its parts. It was in a bullentin but no recall. This is beyond frustrsating! Do we even dare put the windows down? How soon before we replace another window? We only have 46,000 miles. The Jeep is supposed ot be for my wife but with all the problems I am scared to keep it as her primary vehichle.We have had 2 window motors/regulators replaced at $350 a piece $200 a year to have the interior Zi-barted(they get the stains out as often as needed which is once a month)  Plus money for vehichles while ours was in the shop.",NA
"My boyfriend and I purchased the 2002 Jeep Liberty Limited and Sport, respectively. This spring he had the engine replaced at less than 120k miles.  Since my purchase I have had the air conditioner, catalytic converter and ball joints (recall) replaced.  In the last 1 3/4 years I have had the transmission replaced and my recently the cylinder valve springs on one cylinder.  I believe our problems are from the fact we bought the Libertys the first year they were out and Jeep did not work all the kinks out of it so we are paying dearly. 
      I am waiting to see if Chrysler reburses for the cost of the springs and I have yet to file a claim for the transmission and my boyfriend my submit one for the engine as well.  In the meantime we have received no information from Chrysler about the possible problems.  I doubt that out of thousands of models produced for 2002, that he and I have the only 2 lemons.

Now, 6 months later, another rear window fell down and I had the service station look at it and was told it was the regulator in the window.

"First of all, I love my Jeep Liberty (2002)! It goes downhill from here - What is with these window regulators? I just had the rear passenger replaced on 5-30-08. One replaced on the left rear on 6-27-06 and another one on the right rear on 2-28-06. I had to go to the grocery store this morning and when I put my daughter in the back seat something sounded like it fell. Guess what it was? MY LEFT REAR WINDOW! I am a stay at home mother with another one on the way, do I sound like I can just go out and get two windows fixed every 2 years? I am getting very frustrated with this issue. My mother-in-law has had to replace two of these in her front passenger window too. Thanks.

"i have a question regarding the complaint from -----Mart of Oakdale PA (05/09/07) Jeep Commander: Stalling - The only reason my engine stalled on a few occasion was because my knee hit the key and turned off the engine.-----can you actually turn these vehicles off while they are still in gear????? my understanding is (and i think i've had this happen to me) - if you attempt to turn the key off without putting the vehicle in park - it won't turn off. am i incorrect????? 
      just a question.....",NA
"I purchased my 2002 Jeep Liberty brand new in late 2001. I've had nothing but problems and excuses from Chrysler. In 2007 I parked at work (I'm in law enforcement), and much to my dismay, the window was all the way down. The rear window regulator had gone out. Gone was my laptop, portfolio, and backpack. It was raining, so the seats and paperwork were drenched. The local Jeep dealer made the repairs for upward of $250.00. Three months later, the other rear window went out in much the same way. I paid to have it repaired, as Chrysler explained it wasn't covered under warranty and wasn't a recall matter. Now in 2008, on September 12, 2008, I'm driving when I notice both rear windows are down, apparently due to the same problem. I took the vehicle to the local Jeep dealer who once again said it was the window regulator. Since it had been more than a year since they replaced the regulators with genuine Mopar parts it was no longer under warranty. What's more, they price of the regulators had gone up. I would have to pay almost $800.00 to have both window regulators replaced. Chrysler declined my request for an amicable remedy. While the first customer service rep. said she was certain Chrysler would reimburse me for the repairs last year, and pay to have the window regulators installed now, her Senior Rep. declined to assist with any of the charges. According to the Senior Rep., it's not covered under warranty....not their problem. To paraphrase, I should have gotten the extended warranty. Now the Jeep has too many miles since last repairs were done on windows. I also have a problem with the airbag light coming on intermittently. It stays on for a few minutes each time. I refused to pay the local Jeep dealer to repair it because it seemed to be a recall issue. They explained there was a recall on 2002 Jeep Liberty regarding the air bag light, but my problem was different. When I refused to pay to have it fixed, they gave me a copy of the invoice with their disclaimer stating, Customer was made aware of the serious safety risks if air bag warning light is not repaired, but refused service. When asked if Chrysler felt this air bag problem represented a significant safety hazard and concern, Chrysler's Senior Customer Service Rep. said Chrysler needed to determine what the diagnostic results found by the Jeep dealer were first. She declined to assist with this issue until they had an opportunity to do so. When I informed the Senior Rep that I was recording the conversation for my personal use, she abruptly terminated the call and stated she had not consented to having the conversation recorded. Surprise. I want a class action lawsuit filed against Chrysler. Safety is certainly not a priority or concern. The concept of customer satisfaction appears to elude them.",NA
"window regulator!!!!! i purchased my 2006 jeep liberty one year ago. about 2 weeks ago, my passsenger side rear window went down - yes, on it's own - and would not go up. i paid $250. to have it repaired. last week the driver side rear window went down - yep, on it's own - and will not go up. in a fit i contacted my warranty company who advised me that i have no coverage and would need to contact jeep directly. i did so and was told by jeep to get an estimate from an authorized dealer and call them back with my reference number. thinking (hoping and praying) that i was going to get some assistance with my expenses, i called back with my estimate amount and reference number and lo and behold i'm told that jeep won't do anything about it. one of the MANY excuses they used is that there are too many miles on the vehicle. EXCUUUUUSE ME?!?! what does the mileage have to do with the window regulator?!?! last time i checked, i drive my vehicle on the tires - not the windows! this is an outrage!! i work in a customer service business - if i provide substandard products or services, i make right on it. jeep needs to step up - they, along with massive numbers of other companies, have the American public by the purse strings! i agree with many of these other complaints - something drastic - a woman getting raped or a child being killed by falling out of one of these windows - is going to have to happen and jeep will have to get sued before they do anything about it.",NA
"I was driving back from church 9/14/08 when the next thing I know is that I have landed in a ditch, my Jeep kept going through the ditch, cross a road and finally coming to a stop in another ditch. I had a very hard time controlling the vehicle, it seemed that the further I went the faster the vehicle went. I was only driving about 30-35, so after hitting the first ditch (2-3 ft) the jeep should have stopped. I honestly do not know what happened. The road is a two way street, kind of narrow. Once all was said and done, I have a busted right front tire, radiator is busted and who knows what else. It is at the shop now. When my husband showed up to look at the damage he was amazed. I showed him where the ditches were that I went through, and he said that it looked liked I was going about 80 mph!! I know I was not going that fast, the road is a narrow back road that I have travelled many times, PLUS, right before the 1st ditch that I landed in, is a one way small bridge. You have to be crazy to be going that fast.",NA
"My 2001 Jeep excellerates when stopping and has a slow take off when excerlating. I stopped at a traffic light when applying the brakes the Jeep excerlated. I had to again apply the brakes. I never know when it is going to stop. The transmission light has come on and a gas cap was relaplaced when this first happened but now the excellerations have started again. I am afraid to drive the car close to any other car because I don't know if the Jeep will just take off. Also, the Jeep stalls when taking off or excellarating.",NA
"The front passenger window made a popping sound and now the window no longer moves. Upon doing research, I found out that this happens to alot of Jeep owners.

"I have had my JEEP Commander brand new since 2006-there have been no other drivers beside me. I've had no previous accidents or problems for almost two years with this JEEP. This summer my husband was filing the JEEP with gas and a woman came flying across the parking lot into the back of the JEEP. The JEEP was obviously in park and turned off but the crash sent the car flying 50 feet forward and it was still rolling as my husband jumped in to stop it. My 4 year old daughter and dog were luckily okay and belted in still. The car was repaired and the woman who caused the accident cited. Since I had no other problems to this point I am not sure if what happened next was a result of the recent accident or an original mechanical malfunction of the JEEP. The one thing that is certain is that no one wants to write anything thing down about the JEEP lurching forward without warning. So, the story... Just a few days ago while I was in the bank parking lot I had a crazy accident. My JEEP, after backing up, suddenly surged forward right toward the curb and slammed the curb. It hit so hard and went so fast I thought I was going to crash right into the bank. A bank teller ran out horrified and my daughter was screaming. No one was hurt. Luckily no one was in front of the car or it would have killed them. The teller saw the car excellerate unbelievably fast and couldn't believe we were okay. I have never had anything happen like this and have been driving for 22 years. I am really afraid of the car.",NA
"Picked up my Jeep Liberty-everything was fixed under warranty correctly. However, a week later the left rear window regulator went up. I know it's covered under warranty, but I keep reading in Car Survey and Consumer Affairs, so many people are having the same problem time after time. 
      There should be national recall to find out why this is happening. Chrysler must be aware of so many complaints. I can't blame the dealers, after all they are using the parts sent to them by Chrysler.Window fell-worried about rain getting into my vehicle. Without a vehicle to use. So many problems with such a new vehicle.",NA

"I bought a 2006 Jeep Liberty Limited Edition in August of 2007.  It had 25,000 miles on it.  So far, I have had to have three window regulators replaced, and the air conditioning fixed.  I did not know the window regulator was a problem until I took my jeep to be fixed for the third time.  I am so disgusted with Chrysler/Jeep.  They definitely do not stand by their product.  It is only a matter of time before someone is injured because of these regulators. 
      The least of my worries is that my jeep will be stolen!   I see a lot of women who drive Libertys, or just Jeeps in general, and I am sure like me they are afraid that one day after running errands they are going to find a stranger in their vehicle.  I work in a jail, and my Jeep is parked in the employee parking lot, however the inmates are released close by.  In daytime hours maybe the danger is not so high, but at night time, this could definitely be an issue if the regulator fails while I'm at work, which it has the last two times, both rear windows within two weeks of each other.  I'm afraid to really go anywhere and park it, I can't keep anything in it that I value or that would identify me or where I live.  I think it's sad that as much as people are encouraged to buy American, when we do, we get such a shoddy product and even shoddier treatment from the manufacturer.  Does someone have to lose their life, a woman get raped, or a child fall out of the window, before Chrysler will act!  I will NEVER buy another vehicle from Chrysler.  I think that the least they could do, since they know the regulators are bad is have a disclaimer for people so that they can make an informed choice as to whether they want to buy a Jeep.  The consumer is totally being taken advantage of.",NA

"I have just had the window regulator of the third window go bad in less than a year. Fist two cost me over $300 each to have repaired and when I called the dealer to get a price to fix this one because I was in another state and felt desparate to get it repaired, they told me between $400-$500 to fix it. I feel screwed by Jeep/Chysler and the repair shops. I settled for good old duck tape for the time being. It is the rear/driver side window which I am finding it hard to even find the part online. What does this tell me???? That there are an awful lot of people having the same problem if you can't get the part. Dealers and other repair shops are charging well over $200 just for the part. Save your self some money and don't put it there pokets, keep it in yours. Online parts companies are selling these parts for $60-$120 depending on which window needs repair. Ironically, the one that is in most demand is the highest priced. So in the long run, the internet companies are jumping on the money train as well, but it is still cheaper. I hear it is easy to repair, so gentlemen, do it yourself ,and for us women, if we don't want to try and tackle the job, I am sure there is a friend or family member who will step up to the plate and get the job done. Shame on Jeep/Crysler and all the rip off repair shops taking advantage of this situation!!!!",NA
"I too have a defective window regulator.  I have an extended warranty, but I paid $1500 for that with a $100 deductable.  Why should I even have to pay the $100 if this is a known problem.

"I was driving home from work and tried to roll up the front driver side window when I heard a loud pop.  I thought the glass had actually broken.  When I tried to roll the window up again it would not move.  I had to replace the regulator in the window because the cable had broken.  That was about 2 weeks ago. 
      Yesterday, 8/21/08 the front driver side window did the same thing.  This will be the second regulator that I will have to have put in.  The cost for repair is a over $300.  This is the second expense for the same thing in less than 30 days.  I am not happy about this.  If the manufacturer is getting all of these complaints they should really do something.  I am having to pay out approximately $600 in repairs for a the same issue.",NA

"In May 2008 the steering column bracket on my 2001 Jeep Cheroke broke off resulting in my not being able to steer the car.  Fortunately I was in a parking lot and not on the highway.  The car had to be towed to a garage.  As of today, August 15, 2008 the car is still waiting for the bracket from Chrysler.  After placing MANY, MANY calls to Chrysler I've been told the part has to be made by their supplier and they have no idea when that will be.  
      I've been waiting 3 months now, paying for a rental car on my own with no idea how long I will have to wait.

"The news in past few months about Jeep Commander SUVs stalling out is nothing new. I have 2003 Jeep Liberty - same exact problem. Dealers don't fix it - they just replace sensors which appears to be the middle of the problem.

"My 2006 Jeep Commander was involved in an on accident on I-40 near Statesville on 3/29/07 with an intoxicated driver parked in the center of the highway after having beed tangled in the cable barrier. The other driver was charged with DWI and lane violation. State Farm recommended Bell and Howard as their preferred provider for that area. There was $14,884.37 damage done to my vehicle. Bell and Howard preformed the repairs. Before accepting my vehicle I had State Farm send an appraiser to verify all repairs had been preformed in an acceptible manner. I was told everything looked good.
      I drove the vehicle for 16 months with wind noises from the previously damaged passenger side front and rear doors and wind noise from the winshield. During that time I returned it once to the body shop to only have it come back with worst noise.On July 1,2008  I had a third party investigate where the problems were. It was discovered that the doors could not fit properly due to bowing of the front and rear pillars. Upon further investigation it was found that many structural welds had been done and not primed and painted as required by the maufaturer but most shocking and dangerous was that the passenger side front frame rail had been sectioned and steel welding into the area where the frame rail had been damaged. This is not allowed by the manufacurer. Their only acceptible method to retain their designed crumple zone was repacing the frame rail. On July 3,2008 a State Farm adjuster inspected the vehicle and would not allow it to be driven, deemed it unsafe to operate and wrote it up as a total loss. Basically I operated an unsafe vehicle for 16 months because of unethical and dangerous hidden repairs that compromised the crumple zone/ safety restaint system of the vehicle. The dealership/body shop seem to feel that wasn't a problem and basically thumbed their nose that I was owed anthing by their incompitence.  The amount that State Farm paid was less than the payoff, I incurred rental car fees, drove to and from the third party inspector's shop numerous times and had other out of pocket expeses that the dealer/body shop refused to pay. My biggest concern is how many other vehicles and families has this shop sent out the door with unsafe hidden repairs",NA
"I bought a 2006 jeep commander and have had many problems with the control panel and computer system., Last time-still in shop day 5 car stalled completely while traveling 55 no lights no nothing. Dangerous. The Jeep dealer in Maine where it was towed while I was on vacation said he wouldn't even drive it not knowing if it will do it again. Chrysler needs to own up to its [poor] work and take the vehicle off the road.
      I have had to borrow and rent cars every time the car goes into the shop. I am paying 50 bucks a day while Jeep still tries to figure out what to do. I am still paying my whopping car payment without driving it. Thank God on this stalling event no one was hurt.",NA

      I contacted the delearship to ask why this recall had not been performed prior to selling this certified vehicle.  I was given a verbal apology, told to take the vehicle to any Jeep delearship to perform the recall fix and call Chrysler's 800 for any further system.

"I bought my Jeep Liberty brand new in 2005. My first big life purchase. I have had it for 3 years and have put 71,000 miles on it. A few weeks ago, the engine light went on. Took it in for service and they say that 3 coils on the left side of the engine broke. Cost to repair $2000. They repair it, only to find that the noise did not stop. They must now go back in to determine what the noise is. Now, they determine that some other engine part has broken and the cost to repair that is $5800. Total $7,800. For a car that is only 3 years old, it should not be having these problems. I called the 1-800 number for help and was pretty much told that I was on my own.

"I have now had to take my car in for two broken window regulators. The windows simply stop working while in the down position or slowly slide down when not being used and then never go back up again. Today when I took my car to the dealership to repair the second window, I asked that the remaining 2 be inspected so that I would not have to bring the car back when the other 2 inevitably break. The service manager, Erik, said no, he cannot fix them until the break (sure, by then the warantee will have expired). He did comment that the new regulators that Jeep makes are better, which leads me to believe the Jeep knows this is a problem and has fized it, but refuses to issue a recall. I have read online thousands of other people have had this exact same problem   Chrystler/Jeep needs to take some accountability for this!

"My 2004 Jeep Liberty won't start. It is on totally random occasions and seems to have something to do with the security system. We purchased the Jeep in March 2008 and this problem started 2 days after we drove it off the lot. We purchased it from a Hyundai dealership and they thought the problem was the starter so it was in the shop for 4 days to get that fixed. The next day I drove around to do some errands and at one of my stops it wouldn't start again. You turn the key and the starter clicks and that's it the screen below my speedometer then says done. Everything else in the car works (radio, windows etc)so I called the dealership again and they arranged to have a tow truck come get me. While i was waiting for 20 min. I tried again to start it and it worked, so I drove strait to the dealership and wanted to show them the problem but of coursr it started fine. i insisted they keep it till it was fixed so they sent it over to one of the local chrysler dealerships. They had it for 2 weeks and would try to start it and everything was fine, I told them some of the things that seemed to trigger the problem bt none of that seemed to work either. Eventually the mechanic asked if he could take it home over night to see if it would do it, sure enogh he was late for work the next morning because of the issue. They figred it was the computer module and a week later i got it back and it seemed fine. until about 2 weeks ago it started again and it is getting more and more frequent now too. Another odd thing that is happening this time is when the key is not in the ignition you can still open and close the power windows, but only when the car won't start. Anyone else having this kind of issue??",NA
"My 2005 Jeep Liberty has had TWO new water pumps, a new speedometer, a new radiator, new radiator reservior, and isnow in the shop for a new differential, new air conditioner pump and e brake. All this before 50,000 miles. It is an absoultue piece of junk. This is supposedto be ourreliable vehicle. I would recommend never buying a Jeep!

"Driving my 2002 Jeep Liberty to the Atlanta airport. The oil light came on while I was on the surface roads of the airport. Within 3 minutes of the light coming on I lost all steering and the car died. Called the police, had the car towed to my service station. The station owner said that he believed that the oil pump broke and that is what caused the engine to die. I called Chrysler and was told to have it towed to a dealership which I did. After having my car for 4 days got a call from the dealer saying that the chrysler adjustor had denied my warranty claim due to sludge in the engine. My claim was denied despite the fact that i had a 7 year 70,000 mile powertrain warranty and the car was 6 years old with approx. 57,000 miles. Chrysler than tells me it will be around $8700 to have a new engine installed.",NA
"Today was the last straw. My manager was almost killed by a jeep surge as we call them at the car wash i work at called PDQ. I am 18 years old and almost witnessed the death of a manager. She was pulling a jeep off of our track and because we keep the cars in neutral as they are washed, put it into drive as usual and was suprised by a sudden surge. She avoided cars in our 2nd lane of cars (we have three) and pulled to the 3rd lane surging out of control out the garage door, over a large curb with grass, into a busy road, across the curb across the street ending up in the parking lot (about 150 yards for the building) before getting it to stop. At PDQ we take strong action to make sure we are safe when it comes to jeeps. We must call over the intercom when one is in the building and turn on the hazard lights before driving. Only managers are allowed to drive. This was not the only PDQ incident. In another WI store earlier this winter, a girl pulled the jeep off of the track and quickly shot over to the intended 3rd lane smashing into the car in front of her, totalling it, pushing it through the glass door out to the parking lot totally both cars and nearly NEARLY killing a young woman by a hair. Imagine the number of young teens that must witness near DEATH and INJURY experiances. Horrible. Today was the day i decide i need to do something about this. Jeep and Highway control say nothing is wrong and that is COMPLETELY WRONG. If other models were crashing into walls at local car washes (even though some accidents/driver related do happen) were other than jeeps? i may not question it so heavily. this needs to stop. if anyone can help, please contact me.",NA
"I have owned my 2007 Jeep Commander for about ten months now.  The problem I have is when my knee bumps the bottom of the ignition key (turning it to the left, & shutting the vehicle off) which is unusually located at the bottom portion of the console (I guess this vehicle wasn't meant for tall people). When this happens the vehicle immediately shuts off, causing the power steering to shut off as well. This has happened four times now.  The last time it happened was Thursday, June 12, 2008 around 11:15 am. I was driving my 1 year old son to the babysitter's house. My knee bumped the key as I was approaching a turn, shutting off the vehicle/power steering, so I kept going straight, and nearly crashed. Luckily, I slammed the brakes and stopped just in time.  After this incident I realized how serious the problem really is. Although I have to drive it at the moment (backwards, so I can't afford to trade it in), I have become leery and uncomfortable with my Commander because of what could happen to my child, me, or someone else if (or rather when) this happens again. I am now constantly trying to stay aware of where my right knee is at all times.  Instead of reporting this to my dealership (I know they can't do anything about design flaws). I have decided to go straight to the NHTSA and consumer affairs.  I just found out that tons of people are reporting that their Jeep Commanders stall without warning. I wonder if they will realize that it is their knee bumping the ignition key that is the problem.  I really need to find an attourney who can help me asap, please!",NA

"I was driving down the road and I was unable to accelerate my 2007 Jeep Commander. I looked at the gas gage to find out that it said it was on E. I thought that was odd because I had just put 30.00 into the gas tank. I was passing by a gas station and turned in real quick. I then noticed my gages that told me the outside temp was black and all other electronical things were off. Then as I was turning into the gas station the power steering locked up on me and I almost ran directly into the gas pumps. I slammed on my breaks and was able to stop in time. When the power steering locked up thats when I realized the car had just turned off pervious and it wasnt the gas. I put the car in park, turned the key all the way off and restarted the car. The car started right back up again. This is only one of a few problems Im having in regards to the car going out of control.",NA
"at about 37000 miles i was hereing a noise when i would brake, i took it to the dealer under waranty they had to replace the whole front end, this 2005 grand cherekee had never even been near the woods or any rough terrain. at about 52000 miles the front rotars warped and had to have them replaced at my cost of 400 dollars. also at about 44000 miles the starter went on it, had to have it replaced. and at about 56000 miles one of the transmission cooler lines began to leek and had to have it replaced. so far if its any consolation it only stauled out one time. oh and one other thing at about 48000 miles i had new tires put two days later all four tires kept loosing air i had to stop and put air in every two days. I took it back to where i  bought the tires and after taking the tires off the aluminum aloy rims I was told that a bumpy rust had built up inside the rims where the tires get there bead to seal off the air. they had to wire brush these rust bumps down the best they could and apply a rubber adheisive around the inside of the rim to make the tires seal properly. And there was also a high speed balancing problem because off these terible factory jeep rims. Its ashame that crysler gets away with making a piece of junk and pawning it off on consumers and nothing is done about it. I work hard for what i have, but i cant afford to get rid of this jeep and buy another dependeble vihicle, so i suppose im stuck with this garbage grand cherekee until i can afford to sell it off and buy a dependable vehicle. I will never buy another crysler product again the rest of my life after i get rid of this junk Im stuck with for now.

"Since purchasing my 2006 Jeep Commander from this dealership NEW two years ago, I have had countless issues with random stalling while the vehicle is in operation. I have had the vehicle into the service department for days on end, many times only to be told there is nothing wrong. I was nearly killed when the vehicle stalled while travelling out of state with my children on a  highway in central Oklahoma,during a rainstorm and going about 70+ mph. I was stranded out of town. When I finally made it home days later. The dealership laughed it off and said I must be hitting the ignition with my knee.Most recently, they made me feel like I was just being a hysterical female when I said I did not feel safe in the vehicle and would not drive the car on the highway to bring it in during the last reported incident. I then tried to contact Chrysler about the Lemon Law and they only responded with a form letter- saying they were sorry to hear of my inconvenience,blah, blah.....! Today,a friend sent a link to your story about this safety recall by Chrysler. I have been ignored for 2 years and have never been notified of this....Considering, I refuse to drive on a highway with my children in the vehicle- and have had to live this way AND until some day when I am not upside down in my loan to trade it in (if that is even possible with its issues)I am incredibly unhappy that they have now taken a select few vehicles and issued a recall. What about the rest of us 2006 Commander owners who have been fighting this losing battle - and risking our safety for over 2 years now!Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated.",NA
"I purchased a 2004 Jeep Liberty Limited. I drove the car for three weeks with no problems. One day as I pulled into the driveway of my aunt's home the jeep suddenly accelerated and ran into her vehicle. Her vehicle then ran into one the bedrooms of the home knocking a sleeping family member out of the bed. I sent it to be inspected at a local Jeep dealership/body shop and they say that ""there is nothing wrong with the Liberty.""

"I purchased a 2008 Jeep Patriot (brand new). I've only had the vehicle three weeks. The head liner in the vehicle is loose and slaps/vibrates violently against the roof of the car when a window is down. It first started with all the windows up except one rear window. It sounds like a helicopter is flying inside the vehicle. After a week of driving since I first encountered the problem, it has gotten worse. It now does it with any window down to varying degrees, depending on the window and how far down it is placed. 
      The noise and vibration can be stopped by holding upward pressure on the head liner. I have gone back and forth between the dealer and Chrysler's customer service for over a week now. I was told that they all do it and that it is a design feature, it's normal. I have been back to the dealer three times and spent countless hours on the phone trying to resolve this. I have been told that Chrysler will not fix it and that I can pay to have it fixed if I want to (brand new car, lifetime warranty).",NA
"i purchased a certified pre owned vehicle on 4/7/08 when i got in the car the check engine light was on as well as the fuel light....yes, they gave me the truck with no gas. they took me to their mechanic right away and he put the light out and said it was probably because it was sitting fo a while. on 4/10/08 the service engine light came on again and i brought the truck in for service on 4/11/08 i was given a loaner car and was stuck with out my new truck until the night of 4/15/08 they also lied about the tires that were on the truck when i bought it......they said the rear tires were o.k, but when i went to a local service station they said there was no way it should have passed a new york state inspection and the dealer should not have sold the car with those tires. when i picked up the car the service engine light was out but they didi not change the tires. i had to come back after work on 4/17/08 to get the tires replaced. all was good until 5/2/08 when the drivers side speaker started cutting out and coming back on when i made a turn......then i noticed after it rained that there was a puddle of water under my rear seat and the carpet was soaked...i made an appt for service and was told that they have a leak specialist there every thursday to fix the leaking cars. i brought my truck in for service on 5/8/08 to fix the water leak and also replace the third brake light housing that had a slight crack in it.....very hard to see. i was told i would get the car back the same day and then they called me later and said their leak guy could not fix it and they had to send it out and i should be able to get it the next day (friday) friday they called in the late afternoon and said i would get it back saturday. saturday i called and was told that my truck was in the spray booth because the roofline had to be tweeked and the roof had to be painted. monday came and nobody called me so i called again on tuesday and was told it was ready and i could pick up any time. i went there after work and the job they did was unacceptible.....the truck had 2 new scratches on it...my brand new bedliner that cost me $675.00 was covered in some kind of dust from the body shop as well as my carpet along with footprints, a lucky five dollar bill that i had in a storage compartment was gone, and the third brake light lens that was replaced was sitting flush in one side and sticking out 1/4 inch on the other. i went back inside and got jake and he got the autobody guy. the autobody body guy said it must be from damage done prior to me buying the truck.......but the original light was completely flush. he said the only way to properly fix it was to cut out that section of the roof and replace it. i said that the work was not acceptable and refused to take the truck. i was put in anothe loaner that is covered in dog hair and was on my way. this all took place on 5/13/08 while all of this was going on i had tried to get in touch with chris the sales manager and he has not returned my call. i called him on 5/10/08 and he was not in....i spoke to robert figat the finance maqnager and he said he would give the message.it is now 5/13/08 and still have not been contacted by chris. please help me!",NA

"I have a 1997 Jeep Laredo that I purchased over 2 years ago from a used car dealer. The stalling problem started around January 2008. At first it just stalls when on idle or when turning. Now it is stalling while driving on the freeway/highway. I was going 60mph on the highway and it just died. We have changed the crack sensor, the oil, coil, cap and rotor, transmission fuild. Oxygen sensor was changed a little over a year ago. I don't know what else to do. I have brought it to the mechanic 2x and he can't find the problem. No warning code shows on the dash. I searched the web and discovered I'm not alone. It is now April 2008 and I'm scared to drive my car. What can we Jeep owners with the same problem do? There must be something we can do to get Chrysler to fix this problem. There is a recall but it doesn't cover the year of my car.",NA
I have had my jeep in and out of the shop in regards to it stalling all of a sudden.Each possibility proposed to me is not a sure fix and very expensive.Also the lights in my jeep like to dim out some times when I am driving.My anti loc brakes are down also now and I can only use them as reg. breaks. All of these things are very dangerous to me.It is my only vehicle to drive so I use it. I have read about other jeeps stalling. This needs to be addressed.,NA
"I purchased my 03' Jeep from a dealer in 06'. I bought it at what i thought was a very fair price(now i know why). Almost immediately, i had problems with the fan relay switch.Which by the way is under the passenger side headlamp, which is about 2 inches from the fender side of the of the headlamp cavity in the middle. This is important information because the part itself costs about $35.00 and the dealer will tell you they need to take the whole front end of the car apart.They do not need to rip the car apart.They fix the problem in 10 to 15 minutes by drilling into the headlamp assembly like I had already mentioned before. Then they charge you BIG money in labor to have your Jeep sit in the back of the lot all day.DO NOT FALL PREY TO THAT SCAM. My buddy who is a mechanic told me that scam  when I had him change my relay.    The alternator stopped working and my battery died about two weeks later and that was even more money about $300.00 down the drain.The tires need to be filled back up every 2 to 3 days because the cheap aluminum oxidizes and creates a hole between the tire bead and the rim for all the air to escape(that is annoying) about 4 months later the entire cooling system failed and litteraly exploded in my car.I ended up replacing the radiator,the dumb fan relay AGAIN,heater core,and the thermostat to the tune of $2000.00.I replaced the radiator on warranty from the initial explosion twice and to this day,a solid year later the thing still leaks.the mechanic will warranty the radiator but wants to charge me for the labor. I believe they get paid by the company to do warranty work so i wont let them touch it again for that reason(I think the mechanic is lying to me about the supposed charge) and because he has  done the radiator and all its components atleast 2 times already with NO positive results.    They also put in 2 thermostats and I can still hear fluids running through the heater core and that can't be good. To this very day the trucks heater blows cold air to luke warm air in the winter rendering the heater utterly useless.In the past couple months it has developed a problem with the steering(as if there is  anything else that could go wrong). The vehicle no longer turns left easily. My friend the mechanic told me it's the steering shaft.We changed it and the problem was still there. That was $250.00 down the drain. Then a jeep mechanic told MY mechanic, it is the ball joints. We changed them and the problem is still better than ever.It was a good thing i changed them because They were falling apart in the sockets.Nevertheless, that was another $185.00 down the drain. Now we think we have found the real culprate. We believe it is the steering gear box.The gear box is expensive about 350.00 plus labor to install.I have also replaced a front left and rear left brake calipers because the had seazed at different times but whats another 350.00 dollars right!!!! I have huge cracks down to the foam in my leather seats,adding insult to injury    I want the folks and workers at Chrysler/Jeep to know that I owned a full size Mitsubishi Montero sport for YEARS and almost 300,000 miles and I replaced the brakes,tires and oil as i should and replaced the alternator at about 250,000 miles. I will NEVER purchase another cheap jeep EVER again or an American car in general.I will be going back to foreighn cars. What a collosal disappointment this has been oh by the way MUCHO expensive",NA

"I bought a 2003 Jeep Liberty in March of 2003. Since that time, I have had it in to the local dealership to have the back window regulators replaced six times. The last two times have been after the warranty expired and the dealership has given me a hard time about replacing them for free. There is an obvious problem with them as my back windows are never rolled down, but the window just falls into the door. I have looked on the internet and discovered that other Jeep owners have the same problem. I have called Chrysler and they say there is nothing they can do for me until it happens again and then they might recommend a partial adjustment to help me pay for the repairs. I requested something in writing stating that Chrysler would pay to have the window regulators replaced for the life of the vehicle and they said they would never do that. Chrysler should have to fix the defective part and have a recall on all models affected or a class action lawsuit should be filed on behalf of all vehicle owners with the defective window regulators.",NA
"I bought a 2002 Jeep from this dealership on April 9,2008 after examining the vehicle and being given the oral assurance that the car had been thoroughly checked out by their mechanics and there were absolutely no problems with it. The car looked very clean and drove well. I noticed a sound in the engine which I asked to have them re-examine. The GM  agreed to keep the car overnight and have repaired any problem they found. Bob reported that the problem had been something to do with an oil sleeve and that they had replaced it.  We picked the car up the next day (the 10th) and drove it home. Later that day I noticed a HUGE oil spot on my driveway. I reported this immediately to the dealer and was told to bring the car in on Tuesday (the 15th). Upon doing so we were told they could do NOTHING to remedy the problem. They refuse to do ANYTHING to make the vehicle driveable. In short, I am now stuck with a repair bill for $1100 for a new radiator( which had not been disclosed as being cracked) and a rear oil seal replacement.",NA

"After having this vehicle for less than a month the check engine light comes on. I took it to Autozone for a diagnosis. They told me it was a computer memory checksum error and had little info on the particulars. I then took the vehicle to the dealer. He looks at it and then says he is going to have to keep it until the next day. I call the next day and am told that it needed a new ECM, they were on National Backorder and it would be at least a month before they would have one and then there were no guarantees on that. Amazingly enough I could find them on the internet for 115 bucks used and 320 new. I told him to put it back in and call me when he got the part (the vehicle still drove fine). I was told he could not allow the vehicle to be driven as it might be polluting!! Obviously this guy just did not want me getting service elsewhere. So it indeed took a month to get the ECM. Why are companies allowed to sell vehicles that they cannot stock parts for?? I thought there were consumer laws about this. The next issue arose when we left a restaurant before going to a wake. Had the whole family with, got in and the key would not turn. The dealer is closed (I bought the worthless service contract) so I call a locksmith. He tells me that the lock cylinders are junk, have been since 1996? or so and he services 2 - 3 per week in the Fort Wayne area. He replaced mine with an improved after-market version but he says Jeep still used the defective ones to this day. To make matters worse the service contract people refused to pay the 160 bucks because they said I should have called them and they would have sent a tow truck to take it to the dealer for repair in the morning. I told them that we would have been stranded 50 miles from home. He implied that was not their problem. I guess the biggest beef I have is the fact that they MUST know there are both design and material planning deficits and they refuse to do anything about it. As a matter of fact, they just keep right on using the junk parts.",NA

"My wife bought a 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport in 2002 from the dealer, had routine maintenance and even had the recall (see below) performed. Even though I believe it has to be performed again, the passenger front wheel sounds HORRIBLE, constantly vibrating, seems like the wheel will just fall off.. I dont think the ball joint issue is resolved efficiently.  Once she reached 75,000+ miles the real problems began. The vehicle light has come on consistently for the past several months. Brought it to a mechanic, said it was misfiring and 'fixed it, - however light came on again, so brought it to the dealer. They claimed he used the wrong plugs and charged her $300+ for the same thing he did and said there was a 'carbon build-up' on the valves and would be an additional $1000 approx (didnt bother with that). Left with the light off, a week later it came on again. A separate mechanic looked at it and fixed the light said it was misfiring and was then running fine. UNTIL a few weeks ago, it started a light tapping near the valves/intake and we havent driven it for fear it was going to stall (book says the trans light was flashing which means it will lose power). Yesterday it wouldnt start AT ALL; it took several tries and eventually started slooowly. I ran it for a few minutes and performed an oil change, tried 5w-30 the preferred winter weight and didnt change, still tapping. This vehicle should be recalled. WILL NEVER BUY A JEEP AGAIN.   I am going to try some additives and simple valve fixers, hoping to get it up to par to sell privately or trade for a new car.    This is a similar complaint I came across on a jeep forum: The first trip showed a misfire on Cylinder 3, all the plugs were replaced. The second trip was Oxygen sensor, it was replaced. Third trip, they claimed carbon build up, fourth trip was another misfire, 5th was Air Box. We have reset it twice this weekend, going back on Monday.  **Recall ID# 06V288000 - SUSPENSION, FRONT : CONTROL ARM : LOWER BALL JOINT",NA
"Went out one morning to take my kids to school in my 2006 Jeep liberty, started the jeep & clunk a loud noise occured & did not sound quite right. Had it towed to Adams Jeep for service,which is where it was purchased,was called by service dept. to let me know it was a definite engine problem & I would have to pay 4 hours of labor for them to look more in depth to what the exact engine problem was. said o.k.,at this point I could not drive it,it was dead!Service called next day & said a new engine was needed,I was given a quote of 4,900.00,I asked the mechanic if that included everything tax,labor,all parts-he said that would be the final amount. Okayed repair & engine was ordered.Asked if it was common for engines to be replaced in a vehicle with under 100,000 miles on it-Mechanic told me no, more like a vehicle with 250,000 or more miles.Mech. called to say engine was going to take a little extra time getting it in,& was offered a loaner car at there expense(which we found out later,is just a car they keep sitting around for this kind of use.) called week later and was told jeep was ready,when I re-verified the total I was told 6,100.00. Service manager said that the mechanic that was working on the car wrote on the ticket that he had called us to let us know the engine would cost a little more.I NEVER recieved a call. When I asked to speak to the mech.,I was told he was off. After argueing back in forth for quite awhile,we agreed to 4,900.00 and tax.After hearing a sob story from the service manager about the loss he was taking by settling on the price,I believe its me who suffered the bigger loss(5,100.00)I called again to speak to the mech. the next day and was told he was still off. It was not until I picked up the car,that I had found out (by the cashier lady) that the mechanic was no longer with them.Chrysler would not help in any way,because I did not buy the extened warranty.I explained I would have if I was told that their vehicles do not go over 100,000 miles without needing an engine.they said we were way out of the 36,000 mile warranty,and they could do nothing.(vehicle is maintained and has 88,000 miles on it,mainly highway-due to my job-bought a jeep because they run forever! YEAH RIGHT!)Have owned nothing but daimler/chrysler vehichles-but through this experiene,all the lying and feeling of being taken advantage of,I am done with, them if they go out of business from too many lawsuits they deserve it with the way they treat their customers!I would have loved to pursue this legally-but was already at a $5,100.00 loss!",NA

"After having the heated seat element replaced due to Jeep recall, I now have a hot seat!!! Way too hot to sit on even in the low position and even after turning it off. I have asked to have it tested three different times: Told to: Sit differently on the seat, turn it off or don't use it, put a blanket on the seat. None of these solutions solve the problem that it is just too hot in one location on the right side of the seat and slightly warm on the left side of the seat.

"I purchased my 2006 Jeep Liberty, May 2006, it has approximately 21,000 miles and is still under the original manufacturers warranty.  My Jeep Liberty broke down, 1/6/08, it has been in the shop since 1/9/08.  The dealership has been working to try to find the problem; at first they thought it was the harness belt, however,that did not resolve the issue.  I received a call today, 1/23/08, there are severe technical issues with my vehicle.  The dealership has the Chrysler Engineering Department involved.  I had to rent a vehicle and pay for those expenses out of pocket.  I had contacted Chrysler via email; reference number 17137777 EMAIL CASE NUMBER: 1926156  I received a response back from Karrie, Customer Service Representative Chrysler Customer Assistance Center, the following was her response:  Thank you for contacting the Chrysler Customer Assistance Center  regarding the current issue with your 2006 Jeep Liberty.   I have called Swope Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and spoke with Phil the  service manager.  I was advised that they have found a failure code and are currently  trying to work with their technical team to resolve the issue.   We suggest you continue to work with the dealership in regards to this  issue.  Thanks again for your email. Sincerely.  I am disappointed as well as frustrated at the lack of concern and unwillingness to accept any responsibility in reference to the defect of manufacturing by Chrysler Corporation.      
      I am still without a car, two weeks later and the dealership is unsure if they will be able to resolve this technical issue with Chrysler.  The dealership is losing money, they have 2 mechanics assigned to this job, which would usually require one.  At this point, I would like to receive the amount my vehicle is worth according to the blue book and look at purchasing another vehicle, which would not be a Chrysler product.  I have the extended warranty on this vehicle as well, however, that does me no good if the vehicle is inoperable.",NA
In March of 2006 I took ownership of a 2006 Jeep Liberty in which I paid almost sticker price for.  Since the purchase of this vehicle I have had a continuing leak that has not only cause interior damage it is now cause electrical issues.  The dealership keeps telling me that they will not consider this vehicle a lemon as they have not been able to find the source or opening of this leak.  I followed the lemon law to a T and spoke with many mechanics.  The dealership has my car for about a week every third month and keeps telling me that they can not duplicate the leak therefore do not believe it is a lemon.  I over the last year and a half have had the vehicle repaired over 7 times and that is not including 2 FINAL REPAIR attempts by the dealer.  I am in no financial position to hire a lawyer and feel as if the dealer should own up to this car as it's their product and do something to assist me as I have been nothing but patient with them and have followed all of their instructions.,NA
"Purchased a new 06 jeep liberty, thinking this would be a reliable vehicle. What a joke!!!

Ball joints replaced 1x, heater malfunction 3x, rotor malfunction 1x, cv boot replaced ( so far 1x ). Then just yesterday I had a front end collision with another vehicle. This one a chevy blazer, with damage to the doors.My Whole front end destroyed, only front view was radiator, 2 headlights,and a severely damaged hood. Bumper was completely destroyed and still no air bag deployment. I can't wait to get rid of this disaster on wheels.  I tell everyone I meet about this vehicle and warn them about my experiences.

"I purchased 2007 jeep commander 1 month ago and this vehicle has been in the shop more than I have been able to drive it. While driving the vehicle will start to jerk as though it had a bad miss. It has been to the dealership several times and once when the area service rep.was there and they tell me that the vehicle is suppose to drive this way.I had no problems with vehicle the first week driving it but since then while driving it is always in a jerking mode whether I am driving on a flat surface or on an incline. Why would anyone purchase a vehicle that drove this way is beyond me..I purchased a jeep vehicle thinking I could enjoy the ride. What a waste of $50,000.Does anyone have any idea what we all could do with this lousy chrysler product..Chrysler doesn't seem to want to help anyone..It's hard to imagine that this many people would have to keep vehicles that do not deliver what you purchase and get nothing resolved.

"Comments: I am frustrated and disappointed about my 2004 Jeep Liberty and the Maintenance Services (and recall repairs) performed/not performed on that Jeep. I bought the Jeep Liberty when it was brand new on my 48th birthday because I heard they (Jeeps) were dependable, durable, and fun to drive--I am disappointed because my jeep has not performed as promised. I am frustrated because there are more than eight recalls on Jeep Liberties including ball joint, exterior lights, power steering, door latch, etc.--I have experienced all those problems with my Jeep plus others. I purchased my Jeep from John Elway Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep in Englewood, Colorado--now known as GO Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge. I have taken my Jeep to the same dealership where I purchased it because they offered deals on service work. However, there is a pattern at the dealership of not having the parts to make the recall repairs most of the time when I take my Jeep in for oil changes, lube, filter replacement, etc. On three or more occasions, the dealership service department insisted that it did not have the parts to make repairs (while my car was under warranty). However, when the service department finally received the parts needed to make the repairs, I was told that I would have to pay for those parts and their installation because my car warranty had expired (my car warranty probably expired in September or October, 2007). Not only did the dealership charge/attempt to charge me for some of the warranty/recall repairs, it failed to perform the maintenance work on my last scheduled visit for the oil change, etc.. that I paid for. When I took my Jeep Liberty back to the dealership service department to get the work completed that I paid for, I also noticed that an exterior light was not functioning--a recall item. The service department pretended to be remorseful about not doing the automotive work that I had previously paid for, and promised to complete it and replace the exterior light for free--I had to pay for the bulb. However, when I picked up my Jeep, I was told by the service department that it could not repair the light because the housing that held the bulb in place had become so hot that it melted the bracket that held it in place. To me, the bracket looked as though it had been chipped on the inside. The service department told me that it would cost me about $300.00 to replace and install a new exterior lens/light. The outside of the lens/exterior light/housing is not cracked but looks new. While discussing the recall on the exterior light with the service department, I was told once again, that my Jeep was out of warranty to do the work. It is bad enought that the blue book value suggests that my 2004 Jeep liberty is worth under $7,000 (It was listed at $18,000.00+ when I purchased it in 2004), now it has electrical problems, exterior light problems, power steering problems, and my clutch seems to be malfunctioning.",NA
My almost brand new Jeep Patriot that I bought from them has been stalling at idle. I took it in and they said it was a programming problem.

"Safety Recall F25 - Jeep Grand Cheroke *Fan blades of the electric radiator fan may fracture & separate.  We took our Jeep into an independent and had the motor w/attached fan blades replaced before the recall. The mechanic told us that the fan blades & motor were bad & the blades could break. When the recall came out, we sent a copy of our original repair to Daimler Chrysler for reimbursement. First, they told us to take to a regular Chrysler Dealership and have them check it out to make sure the work was done correctly, We did that and all was fine (as so noted on my receipt from the dealership). Next they told us that they would not reimburse the money because the blades had not cracked, separated or broke prior to having it repaired. We asked them how many customers took their vehicles in for the recall repair & didn't have broken blades. They didn't want to hear that.  They refuse to let me speak to a manager and say we're sorry but there is nothing we can do, unless the blades cracked or broke prior to repair (Go figure--that is why they did the recall -- to fix the problem before they break and cause more damage!!!!!)",NA
"Several Incidents:  1) I took my Jeep in for a hard start situation and some other minor repairs. They told me I needed a new fuel pump for the hard start.  They had the car for 3 days.  I picked up the vehicle, took it home and the car still had a very hard start.  Took it back and the problem ended up being a bad fuel injector, which they charged me additional for.  Whole experience cost me $1800, and I got a new fuel pump I did not need.  Now, I took the vehicle back to them, even though I guess I should have taken it somewhere else, and same situation. 2) I took the vehicle in on Monday 12/3 for the transmission geting stuck in third gear, causing a check engine light, and a very small leak.  A couple of drops on transmission, but nothing on garage floor.  They diagnosed it as having a leaking torque converter and bad pump.  Quoted $2300 for overhaul of transmission.  Got a quote from AAMCO for $1900.  The dealer agreed to match the cost.  Picked vehicle up yesterday evening 12/6.  Cost $2242.17.  Higher than estimate.  Some additional work okayed, some misc expenses seem wrong.  Anyhow, needed car, paid bill.  Drove a few miles home and parked vehicle.  While driving to work this morning car gets stuck in third gear and check engine light comes on.  I am taking vehicle back this afternoon, they obviously misdiagnosed it again and now I am out $2242 for a transmission overhaul I never needed.  3)Bought a 2005 Pacifica from the same dealer.  Car is using 2-3 quarts of oil between oil changes.  Dealer lied to wife and said Chrysler design there engines to consume oil for some rediculous reason I can't recall.  Said there was nothing to fix.",NA

Its been in the dealership service about 6 times and the dealership has been unable to duplicate and it never produces codes for a technician to diagnose. On one occasion while it was at Bales Jeep dealership for the same problem it stalled while the service advisor was taking it for a test drive, but nothing was fixed since no codes were thrown. My jeep has stalled near busy intersections, near railroad tracks, and while entering 55 mph traffic lanes.

"I bought a brand new 2007 Jeep Commander car IN June 2007 and it has stalled out and dropped an axel. When the axel fell off it was towed into the dealer. When driving on the highway it stalled and completely died. The last incident the car would not accelerate above 30 mph and when the accelerator was pushed to the floor the car drove at 30 mph.

"I just had to replace the motor in my 2002 Jeep Liberty.  This car has been my favorite car ever up until this point.  I lost oil pressure in the middle of nowhere, and finally got a tow back to my home town.  I live in a very small town (pop. 3240 aprox.) and the mechanic we took it to said he has had to replace several Jeep Liberty motors as the oil pick up screen tends to clog.  I felt totally to blame since I have not been the best about oil changes, until I spoke with my brother who lives in Medford, OR and is a wonderful mechanic.  He is of the strong opinion that this is a manufacture problem and small pieces of gasket or something from manufacture fouled the screen.  He tells me that during routine oil changes you would not remove the oil pan and clean that screen.  Makes total sense to me.  Therefore I feel that this should be reported as a Jeep problem.",NA

"August 2006 I purchased a brand new Jeep Liberty.  Less than 2 months later my steering wheel fell off while I was driving.  (thats right fell off; completely detached from the column).

Afterward, everything happened so fast.  I do know I was driving diaganaly down the road; when I applied my breaks, the ABS went off but I wasn't stopping; I ended up crashing into a snowbank.   My questions 1)Nobody from DiamlerChrysler contacted me re: this error.  When I finally contacted them, I was told what more do you what, we fixed it didn't we?   Doesn't DiamlerChrysler have the responsibility to make sure their cars are in safe, working conditions before they are sold?  This was a major mistake on DiamlerChrysler's part.

"I bought a brand new Jeep Liberty in Jan of 2003.  My Jeep is now 4 years and 8 months old.  I make the last payment next month and warranty has just expired.  I was making a 3 hour trip to my sisters and almost made it to her house.  Right when I got off the highway, it started acting funny and started shutting off.  Luckily I was in one of those car dealer areas where there were dealerships all around me.  I saw the Jeep sign and managed to make it into the parking lot with basically no steering.  Turns out the car dropped a valve to no fault of my own and I need a whole new engine at $6000.00.  I could not believe that my first brand new car only lasted me 4 years and 8 months---and a Jeep of all things.

"On three random occasions during the month of October, I experienced power loss while driving my 2006 Jeep Commander, 4x4 Hemi.   The first time this occurred, I had taken a trip to the grocery store -- I turned the ignition to start the Jeep and it didn't kick over right away, all the warning lights lit up simultaneously, then randomly and at varying lengths of time went out. I thought oh, no my battery's going! but realized that some of the dash lights and the radio were turning on and off. So, I turned the ignition off and waited about 2 minutes, then I started the Jeep again. It started and everything seemed OK (except the airbag light remained on) so I decided to drive home. 
      As I was pulling out of the parking lot onto the main road, the dashboard lit up again, flashing on and off as before, and then a clunk-jerk -- no power steering, no power brakes, lights still going crazy. Luckily I was going quite slow and there wasn't much traffic, so I was able to coast into a parking lot on the other side of the road and stop in a parking spot, where I turned off the ignition. This time, I waited 5 minutes, it started and I made it home without incident (airbag light still lingered for a while). While this experience was a bit unnerving, I'd hoped it was a computer hiccup that wouldn't occur again.  Sadly, I was wrong, about two and a half weeks later, as I was leaving my house (so I was going slow) the dashboard started the same flashing routine as before. I shut the Jeep off immediately, waited about 2 minutes and re-started. No further problems but the airbag light lingered a few minutes as before.  The third incident was the day I brought it in for service (October 29th). I was driving along the main road about 40 mhp on a straight smooth section when all the warning lights began flashing on/off (oh, no!). Only a third mile from my home, at the first opportunity I turned off the main road and kept driving slowly to my garage. I made it there without losing the steering/brakes, lights flashing the whole way.   I no longer feel safe driving this vehicle. The whole idea of possibly losing my power steering/brakes while driving fast is very dangerous and puts my family and others on the road in harms way.  The vehicle was purchased from Desert Jeep in Las Vegas. It has been there 3 times for service (list of inconveniences) and the service has been lousy at best. This being an important safety issue, I decided to take it to a family run dealership - Jim Marsh Jeep. The service staff were much more helpful and genuinely seem to care - nevertheless unable to resolve my problem. These incidents did not leave a code in the computer and they are unable to re-create the problem, so they don't know what to fix. They called the manufacturer, who took two days to return the call, only to suggest that I remove the other three keys from my keyring because their weight must be causing the highly-sensitive ignition tumbler to toggle to accessory mode.  Uuuuugggghhhhhh. I am not comfortable with this explanation. I am still afraid to drive this vehicle. What should I do?",NA

The dealership informed me that the hydro-electrical connector would cost $179 and the seal would be another $199.  $378 not including labor!

"My husband and I bought a new 2006 Jeep Commander from Barton's Jeep on 12/15/2005. Bought the car right off the show room floor. At around 9,000 miles my Jeep started to stall on me. My Jeep does this at all miles per hour. It has happen at 65 miles per hour and as low as 15 miles per hour. When it does this the car has to be stopped and placed in park to restart. So in order to do this I have no power steering at all and have to get my auto to the side of the road. Very difficult when you are driving 65 miles per hour down the freeway. Looking at the car behind you wondering if you are going to die. I have taken my car to the dealer 35+ times with no results in fixing it.

I called Jeep service in Morristown the next morning but they could not get me in until next week. I had to pick up my kids again the next night and it happened again. Thank God we did not get into an accident. I called Jeep service again and they offered for me to drop off my car and get a loaner car. Great idea. I remember the sales person whom we purchased the car from tell us that a loaner car would be included in our agreement. But when speaking with the service department, he told me that I had to pay for the loaner car. So, I contacted Scott Snow, Head of Sales st Warnock Jeep and I explained the above to him. Scott Snow's response was Oh well, that's too bad.Even if my salesperson told you that the loaner was included, it is not true. You still have to pay for the loaner. Didn't you read the fine prints?  What kind of response is this? We have been customers of Jeep Warnock for over a decade and no issue. We have been quite satisfied. We have given them hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales and Scott Snow is turning me away for $30.00??? It does not make sense to me.

"4.7 V8 2007 commander purchased in May. Test drive- all dash lights went out. Took back to dealer and reported this. When I returned a few days later the same vehicle was on the lot and I was told that it simply got put on the lot without some sort of valves being engaged upon arrival to the dealership and that was what caused the initial problem, it was corrected and the vehicle was fine (this is what I was told) Stupidly I purchased the Jeep. Within a few days I started the vehicle to leave for work, put into drive and could not go faster than 5-8 MPH. 
      I stopped, put back in park, back in drive and was fine. This happened several more times and I called the dealership and was told that I needed to turn the key on and wait for all dash lights to cycle before actually starting the vehicle. Tired that, doesn't matter. Same thing happens, just never know when it will happen. I have pulled out into traffic from work place on several occasions only to be bogged down and not able to accelerate. Then all the light went out again and the electronic module was replaced and system flashed again. Still have same problem. I have been back to the dealership five times now. On the fourth trip with same issue and not being able to duplicate I left the dealership only to have the event happen again and I got a service employee in the vehicle with me and he witnessed it. I was asked to bring my vehicle back the following week (this week) and that a service person would drive the jeep home and to work for a few days to see if it happened with them. Guess what???? My jeep sat in the same spot undriven for three days. I went inside and was told, sorry we couldn't duplicate the event. I had written down the mileage and it showed 1 more mile on it than when I left it. I am sure it just turned over when they pulled the vehicle to the back of the building where it sat until I picked it up. I am ready to try for Lemon Law now. I am so frustrated with this problem. Most times when it happens I can put it in park then back in drive, but have occasionally had to turn the ignition off then on again. It feels to me like the transmission is stuck.

I complained to the company very shortly after I made this purchase and your response was that there was nothing wrong with this car. also her brakes lose it tightness when braking and they screech and this car has less than 24,000 miles, the next issue is that the front passenger seatbelt light comes on when it wants to and if she lays any object in that seat the light comes on. my fear is that the airbag is going to come out even when no-one is sitting there and an accident occurs. this is so ridiculous to have such a nice looking car that just may be a death trap.",NA

"I have the 2006 Jeep commander, which was purchased in December 23, 2006.  I have only it had it for 9 months.  The first problem is that I cannot use my third row, because due to the headrest I am unable to see safely out of rear view mirror.  This is very disappointing considering that this was a major feature that drew me to purchase the vehicle.  Most recently, tow months ago my car began to stall for no reason.  I have had all of my routine maintenance done the car is less than a year old, there should be no problem.  It has stalled on me while I was driving, luckily I was in my neighborhood with very little traffic and going at a low speed.  It stalled when I attempted to start it up on two occasions as well. Sometimes when I slow down it sounds as if its going to stall, but doesn't. I expressed my concern to the dealership and they tried to tell me it was the type of gas that I was using.  I frequent the same gas station for the past 5 years and have never had this problem with any of my vehicles. The dealership has been no help. I have pretty much made there sale and now the vehicle is my problem.",NA
"I've owned my 2006 Jeep Commander since September of 2006. I've had nothing but issues with it. The first time I took it to the dealership was due to the ac/heat and fan unit was malfunctioning. Turn on the fan with ac on and hot air blew out. The same results with heat being on. The mechanic at the dealership had to replace the whole ac/heat/fan unit. Two months later it still has issues with turning the fan off with the ac on. Not long after that a much more serious issue arose. Sporadically when I let off the accelerator and tap the brakes to slow at a stoplight the Jeep looses all power and the steering wheel of course locks up. I have to slam on the brakes, shove the Jeep into park and then crank the jeep back up and put it back in drive in time to not get rear ended. The Jeep also turns off at stop signs, on inclines at low speeds and also when accelerating from any kind of stopped point. The Jeep is unsafe for my family to drive and I am afraid my family will eventually be hurt in this Jeep. I now have my Jeep in the shop going on day 2 and the mechanic at the dealer still can't find anything wrong. Computer board sends no errors during testing is all they say to me. The warranty runs out in 200 miles so after that I'll have to pay to have it looked at. I'd like to trade it in to save my family but that will be endangering another family.",NA
"We bought our 07 Jeep Commander brand new March 2007.  We have had it for about 6 months.  In the short amount of time that we have owned this vehicle it has been in the service department to be fixed for 5 things.  
      The first time the jeep had about 2800 miles on it and the home link system and compass stopped working.  They had to replace what they called the computer module.  Then just 4 days after getting it back we had to take it in again.  The car stalled and all my lights came on and it wouldn't even shift out of first gear.  They said they had to replace the ignition switch. It worked for about 3 months and then did the same thing in August and had to go back.  They again replaced the ignition switch.  I am a little scared to drive it because I have no clue if it will do it again.  I have read online where others have had the same problem and they keep having to get it fixed only to have it do the very same thing over and over again.  Now they are going to have to replace both of my fog lamps because they are cracked.  Also my power locks have stopped working and I have even got out of my car shut the door and the car locked without me doing anything.  That is scary because I have small children in my car and it could have locked them in.  SO they are fixing that also.  I am really getting tired of this car and all the problems in the short amount of time we have had it.  We would like to get a new car (not a Jeep).  Hopefully we can get this all resolved.  We didn't go out and pay $35000 for a brand new car that I have to take in to be fixed all the time and don't feel safe driving my family in.",NA

"I have leased a 2006 Jeep Commander and have had nothing but issues with it. At first it was my windows, they would go up and down as they wish. Then the door locks, they would open and close as they wish. Then the sunroof, that also would stay open and would close when it would see fit. What was the last straw, I was driving on the highway doing a good 50 and the car completely shuts off!!! I was terrified!!! I towed my vehicle to the nearest Jeep dealership and was told that I would need a new computer? So here I am hoping it can be that simple but it's not. The mechanic puts in said computer and the car is not even turning on. This is crazy!!! I work to hard to pay for a vehicle that is manufactured incorrectly.",NA
"My 2003 Jeep Liberty has had the rear calibers seize at 25,000 miles and now again at 63,000 miles. Chrysler states this is standard wear and tear of a vehicle. I DISAGREE! Yes calibers need to be replaced, but calibers should NOT seize up totally, especially at this mileage. The first time this occurred the vehicle was still under warranty, but Chrysler is not willing to help out this time around. It's truly a shame to have an unexpected $600 repair bill to a vehicle that you're still making payments on. Also truly a shame that Chrysler has lost the sale of any new vehicles that are in my future.   I did ask Chysler if this was a problem reported by any other Liberty owners, but of course they denied such. Somehow I very much doubt it!",NA
"We bought a Jeep Compass because it was supposed to get 23 city and 26 highway (in the fine print on the sticker it states: 19-27 mpg city driving and 22-30 mpg highway driving with the options on our vehicle)for $27,000. Two days after we bought it we returned to the dealer complaining that it was only getting 17 -19 mpg and wanting to turn it back in. We bought the car hoping to save money on gas...it certainly wasn't for the size! We had a Ford Explorer before - much bigger and got THAT milage! We were told it just needed some time to get broken in. We made several more trips to the dealer to have the computer reflashed supposedly to improve the milage. After all of these trips to the dealers it still only averages 18 -19 mpg by keeping track of the milage and gallons used. This, by the way does not correlate to what the indicator on the dashboard states you are getting for milage.....and we do almost completely highway driving. Finally we did a cold call on the dealership and caught the manager. We had made several phone calls regarding this problem but no one returned our calls 99% of the time. Finally at this point we had 10,000 miles on the vehicle. The deal they offered us was $19,000 for trade in on a vehicle that was 2 months old and now had 10,000 miles on it, BECAUSE THEY KEPT TELLING US THAT TIME AND REFLASHING THE COMPUTER WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM....WHICH IT DID NOT. Therefore, it cost us not only the gas to fill it, but $800/mile in car cost. Tony says he talked to Chrysler and they will do nothing for us.",NA

"This is the first time owning a jeep product and we are very disappointed. Both of the front windows fell and broke out of the blue! Apparently the clip inside the window broke, and instead of replacing an inexpensive part we had to buy the entire motor for both windows, resulting in over $600.00.  Speaking with the machanics at the jeep dealership and the local garages, this is a very common problem for Jeep. Tens of thousands if not more customers have experienced this problem. My garage told us they keep jeep window mototors in stock because it is such a current problem. There is a faulty peice in the window and they refuse to recall or do anything about it. I am waiting for the rear windows to fall next! Please help.",NA
"my 2007 jeep shuts off while in transit, has happened 3x's within aprox 2-2 1/2 months apart, everytime it malfunctions I take it to the service Dept and they cannot find the problem. The first time, it was while on the freeway going about 70mph all power shut down for about 5 seconds, and restarted on its own. 2nd time I was traveling 10-15 mph it completely shut down, this time, I had to put it in park and restart it. 3rd time, I was aproaching a red light, and it completely shut down, I put it in park, and restarted it.

Been to three car dealer repair shops.  After 2 week, they still can't figure it out.  They replaced the speed sensors, checked the fuel filter, fuel pump, throttle body and idle control motor, ECU, wiring harness to ECM, fuel pressure gauge, air control valve.

"In February 2006, my front passenger window fell on its own and would not stay up.  It turned out to be the regultor and cost $260.00 to have replaced.  In May of 2006, the driver's side window did the same thing.  A friend was able to replace it, but the part itself was $250.00.  Most recently, in May 2007, the left rear window regulator has now gone out.  The Jeep dealer quoted me a price of $312.00 for the part.  As a result, I have been driving around for two weeks now with a piece of cardboard holding up the window.  I am a teacher and it is difficult for me to get the car somewhere to get it repaired since I have to be at work so early. Unfortunately the Jeep is past the warranty.    I contacted Jeep by e-mail, explained the situation, and was told they would not consider any reimbursement since the car is past its warranty.

"On April 14, 2007 I brought my 2007 Jeep Compass to Manhattan Jeep Dodge Chrysler in New York City for a 6k mile oil change.   The total charged for this service was $135 before labor expenses were dropped after I complained of the high charge.  The invoice which I regretfully paid was $85.72 which is still outrageous for a simple oil change.   
      The service advisor indicated the high charge was due to the use of special oil and labor.  When I informed the advisor that Jeep dealerships in Brooklyn, New York specifically Kings Plaza Jeep only charges $39.95 for the same service, he insisted that these Jeep service centers were putting the wrong oil in the car; this was an absurd response.  My annoyance with this situation compelled the service director to look into the charges while giving me a $40 credit toward my next service visit.  He also mentioned to fax him any documentation that would prove my argument and he would refund the difference.   On April 16 I faxed the service director a copy of the oil change receipt from Kings Plaza Jeep.  The fax clearly shows a $39.95 charge for the same service and oil as performed and used by Manhattan Jeep.  The fax also showed what Bay Ridge and Garden City Jeep both charge for a 2007 Jeep Compass oil change; both under $40 using the same oil. In addition the service director was provided a copy of a $29.99 oil change promotion certificate, which I received from Manhattan Jeep after purchasing my vehicle from them several months earlier (I didnâ€™t have the certificate with me at the time of the service).  Needless to say I never heard back from the service director so I called him a week after sending the fax.  Apparently annoyed I called him, he was abrupt and said he would credit my credit card $40.  As of today I have not received a credit or a returned phone call from the sales manager who I advised of this situation or the owner of the dealership who I left a message.       Do not do business with this dealership. Besides overcharging their customers for simple services their customer relationship skills are poor and they do not keep their word, which for me and Iâ€™m sure other consumers is more valuable than $40.",NA
"I have a 2004 hemi, I drove it through a puddle about 8-10 deep that was across the road. This is supposed to be a 4X4 'OFF ROAD' Vehicle? it's never even been off Road! If you look at the design of these trucks, you'll find a real brain buster, the air intake sits BELOW the motor, IN FRONT of the front tire. The result was water into the air intake from a little 8 puddle, hardly sounds like a rugged 'Off Road' truck!  OK, the Beauty is I had paid over $2000.00 for the 'Top of the Line' warranty, and they covered NOTHING! 
      I have brought it in for service before on a warranty related issue, all I ever get is an excuse why I have to pay. The insurance company paid them to put another motor in it, but when they did, they stole my other parts that they were supposed to re-install, like my Alternator, AC Pump, all the parts from the top of the motor were rusty and used, they put a junkyard motor in and instead of replacing my parts, the just left the junk stuff on the used motor and kept my 'Good' parts. The sales guy's thought the whole thing was pretty funny, as I was leaving one told me We got your Money again, have a great weekend sucker, the biggest problem with these guys in addition to just being crooks, is they are so cocky about it when you catch them and their rip-offs, they actually laugh about it, well, I suppose why not, after all they seem to get away with it. I'd adding here a picture of a postcard they sent me to try to get me to do business with them again, it features 'My Truck' (same make, etc.) driving through the ocean! It's just amazing how these crooks take advantage of people through deceptive advertising, if you did this you would blow the motor, trust me I did it.

"I live in Miami for school. I needed my transmission rebuilt and my jeep is still under warranty. They got the jeep on Friday and informed me that it would take a couple of days to fix the transmission. Four days (Sunday not included) later they told me that they had done the inspection (it apparently took four full days) and the parts would be in the following Friday.

Even though they are open for service and parts Saturday, I was told that they would start fixing it Monday, now a week and a half since they got it.  I told them I was leaving Miami until August that same Friday and I was given a very shady response along the lines of Well, let me check with my technician and call you back, he might have the part already (the same technician she claimed to have just spoken to). I believe that they are pushing back work on my jeep because of the warranty ($100 deductible v. $2400).  This is the same dealership who only weeks before my regular warranty was up told me there was nothing wrong when I told them my jeep seemed unusually unstable.  Two months later in New Jersey I took it to a friend who found the sway bar badly broken.

"I purchased a Jeep Commander from Maroone on December 11 2006, I had the car less than a month and the engine stalled on me at least 4 times due to a severe over heating problem also I lost considerable fluid from the engine. As I was told by the service manager it was a hose and fitting, so they proceeded to repair the problem, it took over two weeks to get it done. Approximateley two months later I saw I was again over heating, so I checked the radiator and there was no fluid in the radiator, I put a gallon and a half of coolant in the radiator and it ran cool for another two months. Then again I saw I was overheating, so I contacted the dealership for an appointment and here we are again in the shop for the exact same thing. I was treated very very badly. I was told that they would not give me a loaner for the duration it will take to repair my vehicle until I had to contact the GM at the dealership. He made arrangements for a loaner. Please advise me on what action I can take to reamody this problem. I cannot pay over $30,000.00 for a vehicle that is not in factory condition.

"We have owned our 2006 Jeep Commander for 9 months. In the 9 months that we have owned it, we have had 2 rock chips patched on the windshield, and now have 4 separate cracks spreading across the windshield that all originated from below the windshield wipers. 
      It seems that their is either a design flaw with the windshield (is it too boxy, square, and tall/big?) for all of these problems to be happening. We don't drive on gravel roads at all, and have never had rock chips and cracks in our windshield on any other vehicle we have owned except for this one. It seems that the cracks may be the result of stress on the windshield, or just a design flaw in particular. We have a friend that also owns a 2006 Jeep Commander, and they are currently on their 3 windshield after owning their vehicle for 11 months. We took it into the local Jeep dealership to have them take a look at it and tell us if they can repair it under warranty, and they pretty much told us they don't ever repair anything glass related under warranty, and continued to point out that each of the 6+ spots on the windshield (even below the wiper blades) were all rock chips and they couldn't do anything about that.  My biggest problem is, I do not want to pay close to $500 (what we received an estimate for) to have the windshield replaced only to have it happen again and again. I have heard that others have the same complaint about their windshields and am wondering how many others with this same problem have to complain before Jeep issues a recall on the Commanders because of the windshield (not to mention the major problem of the blind spot in the rear of the car.)  Other than the windshield and the blind spot in the rear, we love our Commander, but these two issues seem to be pretty major issues to us.",NA

Was really upset and told her we have owned 12 or more Chrysler products and they just lost a good customer and I would be buying G.M. from now on and more then likely shortly as I figure they are going to keep doing this. Of course they don't care. Checked around and people say there is no way this should have happened.I paid $272.50 for something that was a reocurring problem with a class action lawsuit and the car was still under a three year warranty",NA
"Although Jeep had issued a recall in Aug 2006on the lower ball joints of the vehicle, I did not receive my recall notice until the end of December 2006. I called the dealer and the part was apparently on back order. Its a shame the dealer did not have this part in a timely manner as on 1/30/2006 the wheel of my vehicle came off while I was driving!!! 
      The ball joint had broken which caused the wheel to come off completely. I was very lucky that I did not cause a serious accident!! It was a MAJOR inconvenience as I lost a day of work as well as had to pay for a tow truck to take me to the dealer to have it fixed. When I initially walked into the dealer, a representative had let me know that the part was still on recall. They were, however, able to fix the car, but I am still now out of pocket. I do not believe this recall notification is/was out to consumers in a timely fashion whatsoever and in such a safety hazard I do not think this part should be on back order at all. This is a MAJOR safety hazard that already has caused a number of accidents in the country,.",NA
Total engine failure in my 2005 Jeep liberty. The service manager says it is due to lack of maintenance. This is ridiculous. I have owned 8 Jeeps and I have never had any such problems.They are refusing to fix it under my Jeep warranty or my extended warranty that I purchased. I had no warning of any problems. The only thing that happened is that the transmission light came on.,NA
"My Jeep's freeze plug blew out 3 weeks ago. Then another blew out last week Each time it sprayed 200 degree antifreeze oil all over the Engine and the hood and compartment.  Every time I start the car,it smell like it is over heating.  I asked the dealer to clean the engine, he said Chrysler has to autorize it.  
      I call customer service. They told me it is a maintenance problem.  Since when do you maintain a Freeze plug it is a defect,and they fixed the plugs for free. they claim they don't know what is causing it. so now I have a car that smell and may break down at any time.  I asked them if it is a defect under warranty and they fixed it, since the defect cause the oil to spry it should be covered to clean up the car.  They said to bad, that is their policy.  I guess Ford Chevy or Toyota will be in our future purchase. that caused other damage",NA
"The Jeep commander I purchased on Mothers day 2006 has several problems. The windsheild has wind coming in it it has electrical problems and the paint is job has flaws. The vehicle has been in the shop at least 6-8 times and i am still having the same problems, right now i can not even lock my vehicle to protect my property when I go shopping because of the electrical problem which was fixed once before and the windshield was repaired 4 times. I need this problem corrected and Chyrsler is telling me they will not give me a rental while my car is being repaired under warranty.",NA
"Michael Red Lion PA  (12/13/06)I purchased a 2005 Jeep Liberty Diesel from Chrysler Jeep in Red Lion, PA in 10/05.    Since my purchase, I have had nothing but problems with the engine.  The Jeep has been in and out of the dealership at least 12 times.  I can provide many of the service papers if needed.  PA has a lemon law, but only up to 12,000 miles.  Due to my work, I put on 12,000 miles within 3-4 months.  I called Chrysler to complain about the problems I've been having and the only solution they gave me was to purchase the extended warranty that would give me coverage for up to 100K miles.  The cost of the extended warranty is about $2,500.  I went ahead and purchased the extended warranty and am paying that in monthly installments.  I would like to pursue the Federal Lemon Law at this point.
      The Jeep Diesel has had two recalls, which have been completed on my vehicle.  However, the transmission has had numerous problems that have been fixed and replaced various times.  I've had the Jeep 1 year and it's been back to the dealership every other month and the problems still persist.  The dealership and Chrysler have done nothing to assist me with these problems.  I want to consult with an attorney about the Federal Lemon Law.",NA
"I was injured and my vehicle was damaged when my jeep went into reverse on its own while idling in park.  After the incident I became aware that a recall had been issued for this reason.  I was never informed of this recall by the manufacturer or the dealer where I purchased and have my vehicle repaired at.
      The jeep knocked me to the ground and dragged me while my hand was slammed in the door.  It ran over my leg resulting in injurying my knee.  My hand is cut and severly bruised from being slammed in the door and my body is covered in road rash from being dragged.  In addition, my jeep is wrecked so I have no transportation to work or school or doctor's appointments.",NA
"I have a 2004 JEEP Liberty. Still under warranty. I have had it to two dealers because there is a problem with the transmission not shifting properly. Both dealers told me there was nothing wrong with it. Then I had a local mechanic tell me that my lower ball joints were bad. He took me right under the car and showed me how they were loose. Took it to a dealer and was told there was nothing wrong with it...that it was within their factory specs. I now suspect this is also the case with the transmission...it is probably within their factory specs. Not sure why they bother having a warranty if they are not going to fix anything that is wrong...only things that are totally shot. I now find out that my JEEP is included in a recall for....surprise, surprise...bad ball joints!! Only problem is that I have to continue driving it until they get around to sending me a recall notice. I feel this is unsafe since bad ball joints can wear on your tires.
      No damage yet, but there is certainly potential for damage since I have to drive around with bad ball joints.",NA
"I bought a new 2006 Jeep wrangle rubicon in Dec. of 2005. I have 11,000 miles on it. Twice in the past week the car has suddenly shut down while driving on the freeway.  There is no acceleration, power, etc. Then, the check engine light comes on.  I was nearly plowed into on both occasions from the rear. Luckily, I was going slighly downhill, so I could get to the center divide. This car is so dangerous and I could have been seriously hurt if not killed. I brought it to a jeep dealership. They are going to put it on the diagnostic machine to see what the problem might be. I have yet to hear from them. I refuse to drive this car until the problem is taken care of. It is an accident waiting to happen as it stands now.",NA
